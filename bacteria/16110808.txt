Many aspects of antimicrobial host responses are orchestrated by a complex
network of cytokines and their receptors. This review focuses on recent progress 
in our understanding of the function of cytokines in innate immune responses to
Aspergillus. TNF, a recognition cytokine, has been shown to be required for
initiation of the innate response in the mouse model of invasive aspergillosis.
Several recruitment cytokines play critical roles in mediating influx of specific
leukocytes to the site of infection in invasive aspergillosis. Among these, the
ELR + subset of CXC chemokines and their receptor CXCR2 are critical to
neutrophil recruitment, while CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha
and CCL2/ monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 are critical to recruitment of
monocyte-lineage leukocytes and NK cells, respectively. Of the activation
cytokines, those associated with the Th-1 phenotype, including interleukin
(IL)-12, IL-18, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), are critical to protective
responses to the infection. Conversely, the Th2-phenotype cytokines IL-4 and
IL-10 contribute to progression of infection. Modulation of the immune response
to Aspergillus by manipulating these mediators remains intriguing as a potential 
adjunctive treatment in patients with invasive aspergillosis.
