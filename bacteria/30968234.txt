Methane oxidation by methanotrophs is a very important environmental process in
the mitigation of methane. Methylobacter (Mtb.) clade 2 members have been
reported as dominant methane oxidisers in soils and sediments worldwide. We
enriched and purified a methanotroph from a tropical rice field soil sample from 
India. The highly enriched culture showed the presence of motile, long and thick 
rods (3-5 µm × 0.9-1.2 µm) and minor presence of short, thin rods. The culture
was purified on agarose medium and formed yellow colonies which showed the
presence of only thick and long rods, henceforth termed as strain KRF1. Based on 
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain KRF1 shows close phylogenetic affiliation
to Methylobacter tundripaludum SV96T (98.6% similarity). Due to the taxonomic
novelty, and being the first member of Mtb. related to Mtb. tundripaludum from
the tropics, the draft genome was sequenced. From the blastx analysis of the
contigs, it was clear that the culture still had contamination of another
organism, a Methylophilus species. The data binned in two clear bins: Mtb.
related contigs and Methylophilus-related contigs. The binned draft genome of
KRF1 shows features including the typical pathways for methane metabolism,
denitrification and the presence of molybdenum iron and vanadium-iron nitrogenase
genes. KRF1 is phylogenetically distinct from the five strains of Mtb.
tundripaludum including SV96T, Lake Washington strains and OWC strains, showing
~ 26% DDH and ~ 81% ANIb values and a unique position in a phylogenomic tree.
Subsequently, KRF1 has been completely purified from its methylotrophic partner
and a pure culture has been established and maintained in a WDCM approved culture
collection, the MACS Collection of Microorganisms (as MCM 1471). KRF1 is thus the
first cultured member of a putative novel species of Methylobacter clade 2
isolated from the tropics.
