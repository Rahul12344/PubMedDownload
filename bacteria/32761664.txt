Understanding physiologic T-cell development from hematopoietic stem (HSCs) and
progenitor cells (HPCs) is essential for development of improved hematopoietic
cell transplantation (HCT) and emerging T-cell therapies. Factors in the thymic
niche, including Notch 1 receptor ligand, guide HSCs and HPCs through T-cell
development in vitro. We report that physiologically relevant oxygen
concentration (5% O2 , physioxia), an important environmental thymic factor,
promotes differentiation of cord blood CD34+ cells into progenitor T (proT) cells
in serum-free and feeder-free culture system. This effect is enhanced by a potent
reducing and antioxidant agent, ascorbic acid. Human CD34+ cell-derived proT
cells in suspension cultures maturate into CD3+ T cells in an artificial thymic
organoid (ATO) culture system more efficiently when maintained under physioxia,
compared to ambient air. Low oxygen tension acts as a positive regulator of HSC
commitment and HPC differentiation toward proT cells in the feeder-free culture
system and for further maturation into T cells in the ATO. Culturing HSCs/HPCs in
physioxia is an enhanced method of effective progenitor T and mature T-cell
production ex vivo and may be of future use for HCT and T-cell immunotherapies.
