Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are proteoliposome nanoparticles ubiquitously
produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Typically bearing a composition similar to
those of the outer membrane and periplasm of the cells from which they are
derived, OMVs package an array of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Once
considered inconsequential by-products of bacterial growth, OMVs have since been 
demonstrated to mediate cellular stress relief, promote horizontal gene transfer 
and antimicrobial activity, and elicit metazoan inflammation. Recently, OMVs have
gained appreciation as critical moderators of interorganismal dynamics. In this
review, we focus on recent progress toward understanding the functions of OMVs
with regard to symbiosis and ecological contexts, and we propose potential
avenues for future OMV studies.
