Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, which can result in chronic
lung disease. The sequence of events leading to lung disease is not fully
understood but recent data show that the critical pathogenic event is the loss of
the ability to clear bacteria due to abnormal airway surface liquid secretion
(ASL). However, whether the inhalation of bacteria triggers ASL secretion and
whether this is abnormal in cystic fibrosis has never been tested. Here we show, 
using a novel synchrotron-based in vivo imaging technique, that wild-type pigs
display both a basal and a Toll-like receptor-mediated ASL secretory response to 
the inhalation of cystic fibrosis relevant bacteria. Both mechanisms fail in
CFTR-/- swine, suggesting that cystic fibrosis airways do not respond to inhaled 
pathogens, thus favoring infection and inflammation that may eventually lead to
tissue remodeling and respiratory disease.Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations 
in the CFTR chloride channel, leading to reduced airway surface liquid secretion.
Here the authors show that exposure to bacteria triggers secretion in wild-type
but not in pig models of cystic fibrosis, suggesting an impaired response to
pathogens contributes to infection.
