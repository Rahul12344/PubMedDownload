DNA methylation plays a significant role in tumor progression. In this study, we 
used CpG microarray and differential methylation hybridization approaches to
identify low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) as a novel
epigenetic target in gastric cancer. LRP1B was hypermethylated in four gastric
cancer cell lines, and low LRP1B mRNA expression was associated with high
methylation levels in gastric cancer cell lines. Addition of a DNA methylation
inhibitor (5-Aza-dC) restored the mRNA expression of LRP1B in these cell lines,
indicating that DNA methylation is involved in regulating LRP1B expression. In 45
out of 74 (61%) clinical samples, LRP1B was highly methylated; LRP1B mRNA
expression was significantly lower in 15 out of 19 (79%, P < 0.001) gastric tumor
tissues than in corresponding adjacent normal tissues. In addition, ectopic
expression of mLRP1B4 in gastric cancer cell lines suppressed cell growth, colony
formation and tumor formation in nude mice. These results collectively indicate
that LRP1B is a functional tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer and that is
regulated by DNA methylation.
