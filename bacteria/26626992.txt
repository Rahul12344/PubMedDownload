Mast cells are rare tissue-resident immune cells that are involved in allergic
reactions, and their numbers are increased in the lungs of asthmatics. Murine
lung mast cells arise from committed bone marrow-derived progenitors that enter
the blood circulation, migrate through the pulmonary endothelium, and mature in
the tissue. In humans, mast cells can be cultured from multipotent CD34(+)
progenitor cells. However, a population of distinct precursor cells that give
rise to mast cells has remained undiscovered. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of human lineage-negative (Lin(-)) CD34(hi) CD117(int/hi) FcεRI(+)
progenitor cells, which represented only 0.0053% of the isolated blood cells in
healthy individuals. These cells expressed integrin β7 and developed a mast
cell-like phenotype, although with a slow cell division capacity in vitro.
Isolated Lin(-) CD34(hi) CD117(int/hi) FcεRI(+) blood cells had an immature mast 
cell-like appearance and expressed high levels of many mast cell-related genes as
compared with human blood basophils in whole-transcriptome microarray analyses.
Furthermore, serglycin, tryptase, and carboxypeptidase A messenger RNA
transcripts were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction. Altogether, we propose that the Lin(-) CD34(hi) CD117(int/hi) FcεRI(+) 
blood cells are closely related to human tissue mast cells and likely constitute 
an immediate precursor population, which can give rise to predominantly mast
cells. Furthermore, asthmatics with reduced lung function had a higher frequency 
of Lin(-) CD34(hi) CD117(int/hi) FcεRI(+) blood mast cell progenitors than
asthmatics with normal lung function.
