Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare neoplasms of the
gastrointestinal tract. They commonly present with nonspecific symptoms and thus 
are often discovered incidentally. They are best identified by CT scan, and most 
stain positive for CD117 (C-Kit), CD34, and/or DOG-1. Several risk stratification
classification systems have been developed based on tumor size, mitotic rate,
location, and perforation. Traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have
been very ineffective, making surgery the mainstay of treatment. The discovery of
mutations associated with these tumors has revolutionized the treatment approach.
Imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, used as
adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, has greatly improved the morbidity and mortality
associated with GISTs. As the survival of patients has increased with the
long-term use of targeted therapies, quality-of-life issues now have become much 
more relevant and have come to the forefront of care. We present a young woman
who was successfully treated for GIST but now faces associated long-term adverse 
effects of imatinib, including the challenge of preserving fertility and the
potential for childbearing.
