BACKGROUND: Although enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has been used to promote
periodontal regeneration, little is known of its effect on the microbiome.
Therefore, this investigation aims to identify changes in periodontal microbiome 
after treatment with EMD using a deep-sequencing approach.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with mandibular Class II buccal furcation defects
were randomized to beta-tricalcium-phosphate/hydroxyapatite graft (BONE group),
EMD+BONE, or EMD alone. Plaque was collected from furcation defects at baseline
and 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was analyzed using terminal
restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16S pyrotag sequencing, resulting in
169,000 classifiable sequences being compared with the Human Oral Microbiome
Database. Statistical comparisons were made using parametric tests.
RESULTS: At baseline, a total of 422 species were identified from the 39 defects,
belonging to Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Filifactor, and
Parvimonas. All three regenerative procedures predictably altered the
disease-associated microbiome, with a restitution of health-compatible species.
However, EMD and BONE+EMD groups demonstrated more long-term reductions in a
higher number of species than the BONE group (P <0.05), especially
disease-associated species, e.g., Selenomonas noxia, F. alocis, and
Fusobacterium.
CONCLUSIONS: EMD treatment predictably alters a dysbiotic subgingival microbiome,
decreasing pathogen richness and increasing commensal abundance. Further
investigations are needed to investigate how this impacts regenerative outcomes.
