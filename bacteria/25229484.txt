Abstract Allspice Pimenta dioica as a feed additive was studied for its effects
on growth performance and disease resistance in Mozambique Tilapia Oreochromis
mossambicus. Five isonitrogenous (36% crude protein) and isocaloric (18.5 kJ/g)
diets were formulated to contain 0 (control), 5, 10, 15, or 20 g of allspice/kg
of fish feed. In a 50-d feeding trial, 15 plastic tanks (21 L) were stocked with 
35 fish fry (0.012 g) each. After the feeding trial, fish were exposed to
Streptococcus iniae and mortalities were recorded. The second-order polynomial
regression indicated that the dietary allspice level of 10 g/kg provided the best
growth performance and feed utilization. The greatest survival after pathogen
challenge was also obtained from the diet supplemented with allspice at 10 g/kg. 
Therefore, allspice acts as a growth promoter to improve feed utilization and
weight gain in Mozambique Tilapia fry and acts an antimicrobial agent to enhance 
disease resistance during first feeding of fry. These results suggest that
allspice can be used as an alternative to antibiotics in controlling
streptococcal disease in tilapia culture. Received October 19, 2012; accepted
