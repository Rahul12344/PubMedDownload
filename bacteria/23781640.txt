Chlamydia trachomatis has currently emerged as the most common sexually
transmitted pathogen. It is usually asymptomatic and is difficult to diagnose
clinically. It is one of the causes for bad Obstetric History (BOH) and
infertility. Women at highest risk often have the least access to health care
facilities. Therefore there is a need for a rapid, simple, inexpensive and
non-invasive test to detect C. trachomatis infection. Serological testing forms
the mainstay of diagnosing the disease and to treat BOH and infertility. Hence
the present study was conducted. Enzyme linked immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was
used for detection of IgG antibodies against C. trachomatis. Out of 260 cases,
130 had history of BOH, 80 had history of infertility and 50 healthy pregnant
women (HPW) were used as controls. The seropositivity of C. trachomatis in the
study was 25.4% (66). Out of 130 cases of BOH, seropositivity was 27.7% (36). Out
of 80 cases of infertility, seropositivity was 35% (28) and out of 50 cases of
HPW seropositivity was 4% (2). In BOH cases, women with history of two abortions 
showed seropositivity of 7.3% and women with history of three or more abortions
showed seropositivity of 62.5%. Hence, seropositivity of C. trachomatis infection
was found to be significant among women with BOH and infertility as compared to
HPW.
