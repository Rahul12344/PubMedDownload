BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the most common infectious diseases. The aim of this
study was to systematically review acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
and to represent a new case.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched for articles in nine databases for
case reports, series or previous reviews reporting ADEM cases in human. We used
Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. Classification trees were used to find
the predictors of the disease outcomes. We combined findings using fixed- and
random-effects models. A 13-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital due to
fever. She has a urinary retention. The neurological examinations revealed that
she became lethargic and quadriplegic. She had upper limbs weakness and lower
limbs complete paraplegia. Her status gradually improved after the treatment. She
was nearly intact with the proximal part of her legs had a mild weakness in
discharge. The prevalence of ADEM among dengue patients was 0.4% [95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI) 0.1-2.5%], all neurological disorders among dengue was 2.6%
[95% CI 1.8-3.8%], and ADEM among neurological disorders was 6.8% [95% CI
3.4-13%]. The most frequent manifestation of ADEM was altered
sensorium/consciousness (58%), seizures and urination problems (35%), vision
problems (31%), slurred speech (23%), walk problems (15%) then ataxia (12%).
There was a significant difference between cases having complete recovery or bad 
outcomes in the onset day of neurological manifestations being earlier and in
temperature being higher in cases having bad outcomes (p-value < 0.05). This was 
confirmed by classification trees which included these two variables.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of ADEM among dengue and other
dengue-related neurological disorders is not too rare. The high fever of ADEM
cases at admission and earlier onset day of neurological manifestations are
associated with the bad outcomes.
