Anthrax toxin (AnTx) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of anthrax. AnTx is
composed of three proteins: protective antigen (PA), edema factor, and lethal
factor (LF). PA is not toxic but serves to bind cells and translocate the toxic
edema factor or LF moieties to the cytosol. Recently, the low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein LRP6 has been reported to mediate internalization and
lethality of AnTx. Based on its similarity to LRP6, we hypothesized that LRP5 may
also play a role in cellular uptake of AnTx. We assayed PA-dependent uptake of
anthrax LF or a cytotoxic LF fusion protein (FP59) in cells and mice harboring
targeted deletions of Lrp5 or Lrp6. Unexpectedly, we observed that uptake was
unaltered in the presence or absence of either Lrp5 or Lrp6 expression. Moreover,
we observed efficient PA-mediated uptake into anthrax toxin receptor
(ANTXR)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (PR230) that had been stably
engineered to express either human ANTXR1 or human ANTXR2 in the presence or
absence of siRNA specific for LRP5 or LRP6. Our results demonstrate that neither 
LRP5 nor LRP6 is necessary for PA-mediated internalization or lethality of
anthrax lethal toxin.
