Myxobolus cerebralis, the myxozoan parasite responsible for whirling disease in
salmonid fishes, has a complex life-cycle involving an invertebrate host and 2
spore stages. Water flow rate is an environmental variable thought to affect the 
establishment and propagation of M. cerebralis; however, experimental data that
separates flow effects from those of other variables are scarce. To compare how
this parameter affected parasite infection dynamics and the invertebrate and
vertebrate hosts, dead, infected fish were introduced into a naive habitat with
susceptible hosts under 2 experimental flow regimes: slow (0 x 02 cm/s) and fast 
(2 x 0 cm/s). Throughout the 1-year study, uninfected fry were held in both
systems, the outflows were screened weekly for spores and the annelid populations
were monitored. We found clear differences in prevalence of infection in the
worms, prevalence and severity of infection in the fish, and host survival. Both 
flows provided environments in which M. cerebralis could complete its life-cycle;
however, both the parasite and its invertebrate host proliferated to a greater
extent in the slow flow environment over the 1-year study period. This finding is
of significance for aquatic systems where the flow rate can be manipulated, and
should be incorporated into risk analysis assessments.
