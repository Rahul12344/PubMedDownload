Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) functions as innate biosensor for proteases
and regulates numerous functions of the skin. However, the expression and
physiological role of PAR-2 in sebocytes remain to be elucidated. Here, we
identified PAR-2 expression in SZ95 sebocytes at both mRNA and protein levels.
Intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization by PAR-2 agonist peptide (PAR-2 AP) or
Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) culture supernatant was detected, indicating
that P. acnes is a potent activator of PAR-2 on sebocytes. The small interfering 
RNA (siRNA)-mediated PAR-2 knockdown in sebocytes resulted in defective
differentiation and lipogenesis. PAR-2 AP treatment enhanced lipogenesis and
sterol response element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) expression, suggesting a role
of PAR-2 in the differentiation and lipogenesis of sebocytes. Moreover, PAR-2 AP 
induced cytokines and human Î²-defensin-2 (hBD-2) transcription in sebocytes.
PAR-2 expression was increased in sebaceous glands of acne lesions. PAR-2
silencing by siRNA abrogated the increase in sebaceous lipogenesis and SREBP-1
expression by P. acnes supernatant. PAR-2 knockdown also inhibited the P. acnes
supernatant-induced expression of cytokines and hBD-2. In conclusion, PAR-2 is
expressed in SZ95 sebocytes and mediates differentiation, lipogenesis,
inflammation, and innate immunity in response to P. acnes. Therefore, PAR-2 might
be a therapeutic target for sebaceous gland disorders such as acne.
