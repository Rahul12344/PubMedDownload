A search was made for active cultures that break down DDT. More than 600
microorganisms were isolated from soils treated for a long time with DDT and from
accumulating cultures with DDT or its analogs as the carbon source and with DDT
or its analogs and supplementary carbon sources. Cultures capable of degrading
DDT under conditions of cometabolism were found among them. It was shown that the
dechlorination of the trichloromethyl group of DDT was accomplished by a large
number of microorganisms and occurred primarily under conditions of limited
aeration. The elimination of chloride ions from the aromatic rings occurred only 
in the presence of cosubstrates under aerobic conditions and only with two
strains. The strain Nocardia sp. 306x carried out complete degradation of DDT
with the formation of DBH, DCBP, and an as yet unidentified entirely
dechlorinated product. The most profound decomposition of DDT was produced by a
culture of Ps. aeruginosa 640x, which entirely degraded the DDT molecule with the
formation of phenylacetic acid.
