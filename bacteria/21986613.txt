This study constitutes a first attempt to describe the genetic population
structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in Salvador, Bahia State,
Brazil. A total of 56 confirmed cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, identified
between March and June 2008, were analyzed using restriction fragment length
polymorphism (IS6110-RFLP). The study population was characterized by a
predominance of males (71.43%) over 30 years of age (68.75%). Forty-one isolates 
were found to belong to a single pattern (73.2%), while 15 (26.7%) were found in 
group patterns, forming six clusters. The higher level of diversity observed is
much more suggestive of endogenous reactivation than recent transmission.
