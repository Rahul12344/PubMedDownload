An in vitro model with human serum and human 0 Rh-negative erythrocytes was used 
for studies on preformed BSA/anti-BSA complex binding to complement receptor type
1 (CR1). The serum used was first depleted of Clq, factor D and properdin, then
of C3, C4 or both and finally reconstituted with the desired proteins (serum
reagent). With varying C4 concentrations and 100% C3 present, binding curves
obtained for the two C4 isotypes were similar. When the serum reagent was not
reconstituted with factor D and properdin there was no difference between the CR1
binding of normal serum and the partially reconstituted serum reagent, nor
between the two C4 isotypes in this serum reagent. When C3 at 50% or 100% of
normal concentrations was added to the serum reagent together with 100% C4A3 or
C4B1, the C4B1-opsonized complexes showed more binding than the C4A3-opsonized
complexes. At very low levels of C3 (< 25%) the binding could not be
distinguished from the background. The results suggest that the binding of
complement opsonized antigen/antibody complexes to erythrocyte CR1 is mediated
mainly by C3, originating from activation of the classical pathway, and that the 
difference in properties between C4A and C4B does not have a major influence.
