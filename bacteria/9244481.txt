In a brief review of 50-year scientific activity of professor N. N. Sirotinin and
his students the authors emphasize that this broad-minded scientist contributed
to development of such disciplines as microbiology, pathophysiology,
high-altitude, aerospace medicine. However, his main goal was evolution of
reactivity and resistance, approaches to perfection of human health and
performance. Much attention was paid to effects of low partial oxygen pressure on
human and animal body, to hypoxic states of different origin. Methods of
hypoxytherapy and hypoxic training are widely used in Russia and abroad. The
contribution of academician N. N. Sirotinin to modern pathophysiology,
high-altitude and aerospace physiology, internal and sport medicine is highly
appreciated in Russia.
