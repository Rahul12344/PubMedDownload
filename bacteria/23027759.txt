Bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a 3'-5' processive
exoribonuclease that participates in mRNA turnover and quality control of rRNA
precursors in many bacterial species. It also associates with the RNase E
scaffold and other components to form a multi-enzyme RNA degradasome machinery
that performs a wider regulatory role in degradation, quality control and
maturation of mRNA and noncoding RNA. Several crystal structures of bacterial
PNPases, as well as some biological activity studies, have been published.
However, how the enzymatic activity of PNPase is regulated is less well
understood. Recently, Escherichia coli PNPase was found to be a direct c-di-GMP
binding target, raising the possibility that c-di-GMP may participate in the
regulation of RNA processing. Here, the successful cloning, purification and
crystallization of S1-domain-truncated Xanthomonas campestris PNPase
(XcPNPaseΔS1) in the presence of c-di-GMP are reported. The crystals belonged to 
the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 132.76, b = 128.38, 
c = 133.01 Å, γ = 93.3°, and diffracted to a resolution of 2.00 Å.
