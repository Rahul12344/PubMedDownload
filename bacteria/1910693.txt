Human B lymphocyte differentiation is regulated by signals transmitted after
binding of cytokines to their specific receptors and/or cross-linking of
cell-cell adhesion receptors. In addition to surface immunoglobulin (sIg)
receptors for antigen, a number of B cell-associated surface molecules have now
been identified which may regulate activation and adhesion of B cells. These
include members of the Ig supergene family such as CD19, CD22, B7/BB1, and BMC1, 
cell surface enzymes such as CD10, CD73, and CDw75, and proteins with multiple
transmembrane domains such as CD20 and CD37. In this review we describe how
several of these accessory molecules may affect signaling via antigen receptors
and influence primary vs secondary immune responses. For instance, signaling via 
either CD21 or CD22 can augment responses to anti-Ig; the B cell activation
marker B7/BB1 may function to trigger T cells via its ligand, CD28, to produce
cytokines which in turn stimulate B cells; and the receptor, CD40, may transmit a
signal to protect germinal center B cells from undergoing programmed cell death. 
Understanding how B cell accessory molecules regulate key interconnections during
development may provide insights into the control and management of diseases with
B-cell dysfunctions.
