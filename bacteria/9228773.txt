The presence of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), an enzyme catalyzing the final
step of arginine biosynthesis, was demonstrated in the heterocystous
cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 73102 by measuring in vitro enzyme activity and by
visualization of ASL in native protein gels. Activity staining of a native PAGE
gel revealed one ASL-dependent band with a molecular mass of about 240 kDa. A
colorimetric assay for ASL based on the measurement of urea produced from
arginine in the presence of an excess of arginase was further used to analyze the
cyanobacterial ASL. The in vitro ASL activity was highest in cells in exponential
growth phase and decreased significantly during the stationary phase of growth,
ranging from 4.4 to 0.8 nmol of product formed (mg protein)-1 min-1. Including
arginine, citrulline or ornithine in the growth medium resulted in no significant
change in the ASL activities, indicating that Nostoc PCC 73102 ASL is not
regulated by metabolites of the ornithine cycle.
