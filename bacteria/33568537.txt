OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the association between group A Streptococcus
(GAS) pharyngeal exposures and exacerbations of tics in a large multicenter
population of youth with chronic tic disorders (CTD) across Europe.
METHODS: We followed up 715 children with CTD (age 10.7 ± 2.8 years, 76.8% boys),
recruited by 16 specialist clinics from 9 countries, and followed up for 16
months on average. Tic, obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS), and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) severity was assessed during
4-monthly study visits and telephone interviews. GAS exposures were analyzed
using 4 possible combinations of measures based on pharyngeal swab and serologic 
testing. The associations between GAS exposures and tic exacerbations or changes 
of tic, OC, and ADHD symptom severity were measured, respectively, using
multivariate logistic regression plus multiple failure time analyses and mixed
effects linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 405 exacerbations occurred in 308 of 715 (43%) participants. 
The proportion of exacerbations temporally associated with GAS exposure ranged
from 5.5% to 12.9%, depending on GAS exposure definition. We did not detect any
significant association of any of the 4 GAS exposure definitions with tic
exacerbations (odds ratios ranging between 1.006 and 1.235, all p values >0.3).
GAS exposures were associated with longitudinal changes of
hyperactivity-impulsivity symptom severity ranging from 17% to 21%, depending on 
GAS exposure definition.
CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support GAS exposures as contributing factors
for tic exacerbations in children with CTD. Specific workup or active management 
of GAS infections is unlikely to help modify the course of tics in CTD and is
therefore not recommended.
