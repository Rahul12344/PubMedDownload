Measurement of thioesterification activities for dodecanoic acid (C12) and
ketoprofen was done using five firefly luciferases, from Pyrocoelia miyako (PmL),
Photinus pyralis (PpL), Luciola cruciata (LcL), Hotaria parvura (HpL), and
Luciola mingrelica (LmL). Among these, PmL, PpL, and LcL showed the expected
thioesterification activities toward both substrates. All the enzymes exhibited
(R)-enantioselectivity toward ketoprofen, which had same tendency as firefly
luciferase from Luciola lateralis (LUC-H). HpL and LmL, however, did not accept
ketoprofen, although they had thioesterification activity toward C12. These
results indicate that the substrate acceptance of luciferases for the
thioesterification reaction varies dramatically relying on the origin of firefly.
Hence we focused primarily on PmL and investigated the effect of pH on enzymatic 
activity. In addition, by determining the kinetic parameters at various pH
values, we verified that the k(cat) parameter contributed to the preferential
enantioselectivity of this enzyme.
