OBJECTIVES: Death domain-associated protein (Daxx) has been recently implicated
as a positive factor in ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, but the role of Daxx 
in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has never been addressed. Herein, we
investigate the expression and function of Daxx in OSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RT-quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and
immunohistochemistry were used to evaluation of the expression of Daxx in human
OSCC cell lines and clinical surgical specimens. Short hairpin RNA targeting Daxx
was transduced by lentivirus infection to knockdown the expression of Daxx in SAS
and SCC25 cell lines, and the influence of this knockdown was evaluated by
analyzing the growth and the cell cycle in transduced cells. Immunoprecipitation 
and sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR were used to
analyze the associations between Daxx, TCF4, and cyclin D1 promoter. Xenograft
tumor model was used to evaluate the in vivo tumorigenicity of Daxx in OSCC.
RESULTS: Daxx mRNA and protein expression are elevated in several OSCC cell lines
and human OSCC samples in comparison to those in normal tissue. We further find
that depletion of Daxx decreases OSCC cell growth activity through G1 cell cycle 
arrest. Daxx silencing reduces cyclin D1 expression via a Daxx-TCF4 interaction, 
whereas the Daxx depletion-mediated G1 arrest can be relieved by ectopic
expression of cyclin D1. Moreover, we show that in OSCC clinical samples, the
expression of Daxx is significantly correlated with that of cyclin D1.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the importance of Daxx in regulation of cyclin
D1 expression and provide the first evidence that Daxx exhibits tumor-promoting
activity in OSCC.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Daxx plays an important role in malignant transformation of
OSCC and may serves as a target for cancer prevention and treatment.
