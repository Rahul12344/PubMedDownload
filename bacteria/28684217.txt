Interaction between the activating NKG2D receptor on lymphocytes and its ligands 
MICA, MICB, and ULBP1-6 modulate T and NK cell activity and may contribute to the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). NKG2D ligands are generally not expressed
on the cell surface of normal, non-stressed cells, but expression of MICA and
MICB in CD intestine has been reported. In this exploratory study, we further
characterize the expression of NKG2D and its ligands, including the less
well-described ULBP4-6, in CD, and test if NKG2D ligand interactions are involved
in the migration of activated T cells into the affected mucosal compartments.
Intestinal tissue from CD patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow
cytometry, mass cytometry, and immunohistochemistry for expression of NKG2D and
ligands, and for cytokine release. Furthermore, NKG2D-dependent chemotaxis of
activated CD8+ T cells across a monolayer of ligand-expressing human intestinal
endothelial cells was examined. Activated lymphocytes down-regulated NKG2D
expression upon accumulation in inflamed CD intestine. NKG2D expression on CD56+ 
T and γδ T cells from inflamed tissue seemed inversely correlated with CRP levels
and cytokine release. B cells, monocytes, mucosal epithelium, and vascular
endothelium expressed NKG2D ligands in inflamed CD intestine. The expression of
NKG2D ligands was correlated with cytokine release, but was highly variable
between patients. Stimulation of vascular intestinal endothelial cells in vitro
induced expression of NKG2D ligands, including MICA/B and ULBP2/6. Blockade of
NKG2D on CD8+ T cells inhibited the migration over ligand-expressing endothelial 
cells. Intestinal induction of NKG2D ligands and ligand-induced down-regulation
of NKG2D in CD suggest that the NKG2D-ligand interaction may be involved in both 
the activation and recruitment of NKG2D+ lymphocytes into the inflamed CD
intestine.
