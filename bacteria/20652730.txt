INTRODUCTION: We describe a previously unreported 437 T→G missense mutation
producing a V146G substitution in the first coiled-coil (CC1) domain of nuclear
factor-κB essential modulator (NEMO) in a 9-month-old boy with ectodermal
dysplasia with immunodeficiency who presented with methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus subdural empyema. We performed in vitro experiments to
determine if this novel mutation resulted in impaired NF-κB signaling.
METHODS: IκBα phosphorylation experiments were performed using a Jurkat T cell
line lacking endogenous NEMO expression that was transfected with vectors
containing either the wild type or the patient's V146G mutation. The cells were
stimulated with TNF-α to activate the NF-κB pathway. Phosphorylated IκBα was
detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IκBα antibodies. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from the patient were stimulated with TNF-α or anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28. Impaired IκBα degradation was detected using antibodies against the
IκBα protein.
RESULTS: While TNF-α stimulation resulted in IκBα phosphorylation in
NEMO-deficient Jurkat cells reconstituted with wild-type NEMO, cell transfected
with the V146G mutant exhibited a 75% reduction in phospho-IκBα. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from the patient showed impaired degradation of IκBα after
stimulation when compared with normal controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient's V146G mutation results in impaired NF-κB activation in
vitro. The mutation extends the known N-terminal boundary within the CC1 domain
that produces an ectodermal dysplasia phenotype, and defines an infectious
susceptibility previously unappreciated in ectodermal dysplasia with
immunodeficiency (methicillin-resistant S. aureus subdural empyema), broadening
the clinical spectrum associated with the disease.
