There are contradictory literature reports on the role of verotoxin (VT) in
adherence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157 EHEC) to intestinal
epithelium. There are reports that putative virulence genes of O island 7 (OI-7),
OI-15, and OI-48 of this pathogen may also affect adherence in vitro. Therefore, 
mutants of vt2 and segments of OI-7 and genes aidA(15) (gene from OI-15) and
aidA(48) (gene from OI-48) were generated and evaluated for adherence in vitro to
cultured human HEp-2 and porcine jejunal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells and in vivo
to enterocytes in pig ileal loops. VT2-negative mutants showed significant
decreases in adherence to both HEp-2 and IPEC-J2 cells and to enterocytes in pig 
ileal loops; complementation only partially restored VT2 production but fully
restored the adherence to the wild-type level on cultured cells. Deletion of OI-7
and aidA(48) had no effect on adherence, whereas deletion of aidA(15) resulted in
a significant decrease in adherence in pig ileal loops but not to the cultured
cells. This investigation supports the findings that VT2 plays a role in
adherence, shows that results obtained in adherence of E. coli O157:H7 in vivo
may differ from those obtained in vitro, and identified AIDA-15 as having a role 
in adherence of E. coli O157:H7.
