pill users in Alexandria.

PIP: A stratified random sample of 1000 women with proportionate allocation
according to district of residence was taken from normal females living in
Alexandria, Egypt, and attending family planning centers in order to understand
social-pathological changes in the vaginal flora of oral contraceptive (OC)
users. Cases were examined over 18 months, and all cases were given a combined
OC. Bacteriology and pH changes in vaginal flora were determined after 18 months.
Results of the bacteriological examination revealed a positive correlation
between those having a vaginal discharge and pH above 5, mixed infection, and
illiteracy. As the duration of pill use increased, so did the incidence of
monilla, staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic streptococci, gram negative bacilli,
trichomonas vaginalis, and hemophilus vaginalis, whereas lactobacilli decreased. 
Duration of pill use also corresponded to increase in vaginal pH. Longer duration
of OC use, practice of bad hygiene, and illiteracy were factors associated with
an alkaline pH, changed pattern of vaginal flora, and greater susceptibility to
infection by staph aureus and E. coli.
