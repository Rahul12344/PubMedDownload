The glucocorticoid-induced TNF-related gene receptor (GITR) is the newest member 
of the costimulatory molecule family and is expressed on both resting CD4+CD25+
regulatory T (T(R)) cells and activated CD4+ T cells. We investigated the
endogenous mechanisms that regulate GITR expression on both T(R) and CD4+ T
cells, as well as the functional interaction between GITR and other costimulatory
molecules. CD28 stimulation increased GITR expression on both T(R) and CD4+ T
cells via IL-2-dependent mechanisms. In addition, ligation of GITR and/or CD28
increased the level of CD4+ T cell proliferation and effector function under both
APC-dependent and -independent conditions, suggesting that these costimulatory
molecules cooperate to regulate CD4+ T cell activation and function by directly
signaling to the CD4+ T cell. Thus, GITR may serve opposing functional roles on
CD4+ T(R) and effector cells and alterations in GITR expression and/or function
may tip the balance between immune tolerance and effector function.
