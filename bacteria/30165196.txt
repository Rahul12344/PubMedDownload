We previously identified a metastasis suppressor RAB37 small GTPase that
regulated exocytosis of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) to
suppress lung cancer metastasis. Here, we show that vesicle-associated membrane
protein 8 (VAMP8), a v-SNARE (vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
activating protein receptor), interacts with RAB37 and drives the secretion of
TIMP1 to inhibit tumor metastases. Confocal and total internal reflection
fluorescence microscopic images demonstrated that VAMP8 co-localized with RAB37
and facilitated trafficking of RAB37-TIMP1 vesicles. Reconstitution experiments
using tail-vein injection and lung-to-lung metastasis in mice showed that VAMP8
was essential for RAB37-regulated vesicle trafficking of TIMP1 to suppress cancer
metastasis. Lung cancer patients with low VAMP8 showed distant metastasis, poor
overall survival and progression-free survival. Importantly, multivariate Cox
regression analysis indicated that patients with low VAMP8/low RAB37 expression
profile showed significantly high risk of death (hazard ratio = 3.42, P < 0.001) 
even after adjusting for tumor metastasis parameter. Our findings reveal that
VAMP8 is a novel v-SNARE crucial for RAB37-mediated exocytic transport of TIMP1
to suppress lung tumor metastasis. VAMP8 possesses a tumor metastasis suppressor 
function with a prognostic value in lung cancer.
