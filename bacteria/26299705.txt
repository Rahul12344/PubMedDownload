The cellular prion protein is expressed in almost all tissues, including the
central nervous system and lymphoid tissues. To investigate the effects of the
prion protein in lymphoid cells and spleen structure formation, we used prion
protein-deficient (Prnp(0/0)) Zürich I mice generated by inactivation of the Prnp
gene. Prnp(0/0) mice had decreased lymphocytes, in particular, CD4 T cells and
lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Decreased CD4 T cells resulted from impaired
expression of CCL19 and CCL21 in the spleen rather than altered chemokine
receptor CCR7 expression. Importantly, some of the white pulp regions in spleens 
from Prnp(0/0) mice displayed impaired T zone structure as a result of decreased 
LTi cell numbers and altered expression of the lymphoid tissue-organizing genes
lymphotoxin-α and CXCR5, although expression of the lymphatic marker podoplanin
and CXCL13 by stromal cells was not affected. In addition, CD3(-)CD4(+)IL-7Rα(+) 
LTi cells were rarely detected in impaired white pulp in spleens of these mice.
These data suggest that the prion protein is required to form the splenic white
pulp structure and for development of normal levels of CD4 T and LTi cells.
