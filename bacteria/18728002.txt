The human endometrium undergoes cyclical changes regulated by sex hormones.
Evidence suggests that sex hormones regulate NK cell recruitment into the uterus 
in large numbers. NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed on human NK cells,
gammadelta and CD8 T cells. NKG2D ligands are known to be sensors of cellular
"stress". In this study, we investigated whether sex hormones directly regulate
expression of NKG2D ligands in the human uterus. Estradiol increased MICA
expression on uterine epithelial cells; regulation was estrogen
receptor-dependent. Real-time PCR analysis showed that NKG2D ligands MICA and
MICB were expressed in the human endometrium. MICA protein was detected primarily
on epithelial cells, and greater expression was observed in immunohistochemical
analysis of tissues from patients in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. 
Thus, estrogens regulate expression of MICA. These data suggest hormonal
regulation of innate immunity and NKG2D-mediated recognition in other tissues and
diseases where estrogen may be involved.
