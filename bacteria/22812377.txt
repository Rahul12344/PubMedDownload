Synthetic studies of the antimicrobial secondary metabolite thiomuracin A (1)
were initiated to improve chemical stability and physicochemical properties.
Functional group modifications of 1 included removing the C2-C7 side chain,
derivatizing the C84 epoxide region, and altering the C44 hydroxyphenylalanine
motif. The resulting derivatives simplified and stabilized the chemical structure
and were evaluated for antibacterial activity relative to 1. The simplified
structure and improved organic solubility of the derivatives facilitated
isolation yields from fermentation broths and simplified the procedures involved 
for the process. These advancements increased material supply for continued
medicinal chemistry optimization and culminated in the identification of 2, a
structurally simplified and chemically stable analogue of 1 which retained potent
antibiotic activity.
