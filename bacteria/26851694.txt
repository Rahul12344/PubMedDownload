OBJECTIVE: Central nervous system (CNS) infections after cervical spine surgery
are a rare but serious complication and may be caused by uncommon pathogens. We
report the case of a 57-year-old male who developed slowly progressive mental
confusion with headaches, increased daytime sleepiness and mild gait disturbance 
within the last 3 weeks. Six weeks prior to admission to our department, he
underwent an atlantoaxial fusion by C1-C2 transarticular screw fixation for
rheumatoid arthritis related C1-C2 multidirectional instability.
METHODS: We analyzed clinical and neuroradiological findings.
RESULTS: The findings were consistent with communicating hydrocephalus secondary 
to ventriculitis and the left C1-C2 screw was found to be misplaced with
perforation of the dura. The situation was interpreted as implant related
surgical site infection of the cerebrospinal fluid followed by ventriculitis and 
hydrocephalus. Bacterial broad range 16S rRNA gene PCR from the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) followed by sequencing identified Aggregatibacter aphrophilus as the 
causative agent, while conventional cultures remained negative due to its
fastidious growth. The patient was successfully treated with a lumbar drain and
intravenous ceftriaxone.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of Aggregatibacter
aphrophilus ventriculitis following C1-C2 transarticular screw fixation.
