Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis, remains
the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide. The
emergence of drug-resistant M.tb strains stresses the need for drugs acting on
new targets. Mycolic acids are very long chain fatty acids playing an essential
role in the architecture and permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall. Their
biosynthesis involves two fatty acid synthase (FAS) systems. Among the four
enzymes (MabA, HadAB/BC, InhA and KasA/B) of the FAS-II cycle, MabA (FabG1)
remains the only one for which specific inhibitors have not been reported yet.
The development of a new LC-MS/MS based enzymatic assay allowed the screening of 
a 1280 fragment-library and led to the discovery of the first small molecules
that inhibit MabA activity. A fragment from the anthranilic acid series was
optimized into more potent inhibitors and their binding to MabA was confirmed by 
19F ligand-observed NMR experiments.
