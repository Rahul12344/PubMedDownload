rheumatism].

[Article in Russian]

Goriaeva NIu.

A study of histocompatibility antigens in 165 patients with rheumatic fever
showed that the most commonly high titers of ASL-O, ASH, ADNAse B were found in
the carriers of HLA, A11, B27, CW1, CW2, CW3, DR5 and DR7 antigens which,
according to our data, were associated with rheumatic fever. High titers of
streptococcal antibodies were found in persons with HLA-A1 and B27.
