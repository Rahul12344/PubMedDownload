Pregnancy is a special period marked with complicated changes in various immune
responses. Although pregnant women are prone to developing gingival inflammation,
its immunological mechanism remains to be clarified. In a modified
ligature-induced periodontal disease murine model, pregnant mice developed more
severe alveolar bone loss. Using this model, we investigated the Treg responses
during exacerbated periodontal disease in pregnant mice. We tested
Treg-associated molecules in gingival tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and
found decreased gingival expression of Foxp3, TGFβ, CTLA-4, and CD28 in pregnant 
mice after periodontal disease induction. We further confirmed that lower number 
of Treg cells were present in the cervical lymph nodes of pregnant periodontitis 
mice. Treg cells from the cervical lymph nodes of ligated pregnant mice and
non-pregnant mice were tested for their suppressive function in vitro. We
manifested that Treg suppressive function was also down-regulated in the pregnant
mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that more inflammatory Th17 cells were
present in the cervical lymph nodes of ligated pregnant mice. Therefore, impaired
Treg development and function, together with upregulated Th17 response, may
contribute to the exacerbated periodontal disease during pregnancy.
