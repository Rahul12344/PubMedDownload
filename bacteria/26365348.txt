Fhb is a surface virulence protein from Streptococcus suis, which could aid
bacterial evasion of host innate immune defense by recruiting complement
regulator factor H to inactivate C3b deposited on bacterial surface in blood.
Here we successfully expressed and purified the N terminal domain of Fhb (N-Fhb) 
and obtained crystals of the N-Fhb by sitting-drop vapor diffusion method with a 
resolution of 1.50 Å. The crystals belong to space group C2 with unit cell
parameters a = 127.1 Å, b = 77.3 Å, c = 131.6 Å, α = 90°, β = 115.9°, γ = 90°.
The structure of N-Fhb was determined by SAD method and the core structure of
N-Fhb is a β sandwich. We speculated that binding of Fhb to human factor H may be
mainly mediated by surface amino acids with negative charges.
