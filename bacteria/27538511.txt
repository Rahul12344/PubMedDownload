Some melanomas and hepatocellular carcinomas have been shown to be auxotrophic
for arginine. Arginine deiminase (ADI), an arginine degrading enzyme isolated
from Mycoplasma, can inhibit the growth of these tumors. It is a catabolizing
enzyme which catabolizes arginine to Citrulline. Tumor cells do not express an
enzyme called arginosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and hence, these cells become
auxotrophic for arginine. It is found that ADI is specific for arginine and did
not degrade other amino acid. This review covers various aspects of ADIs like
origin, properties and chemical modifications for better antitumor activity.
