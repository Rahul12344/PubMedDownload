OBJECTIVES: Human tuberculosis (TB) remains an important cause of death globally.
Bangladesh is one of the most affected countries. We aimed to investigate the
impact of pulmonary TB on pro- and anticoagulant mechanisms.
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in Chittagong, Bangladesh. We
performed an in-depth analysis of coagulation activation and inhibition in plasma
obtained from 64 patients with primary lung TB and 11 patients with recurrent
lung TB and compared these with 37 healthy controls. Additionally, in nine
patients coagulation activation was studied in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) harvested from the site of infection and compared with BALF from a
contralateral unaffected lung subsegment.
RESULTS: Relative to uninfected controls, primary and recurrent TB were
associated with a systemic net procoagulant state, as indicated by enhanced
activation of coagulation (elevated plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin
complexes, D-dimer and fibrinogen) together with impaired anticoagulant
mechanisms (reduced plasma levels of antithrombin, protein C activity, free
protein S, and protein C inhibitor). Activation of coagulation did not correlate 
with plasma concentrations of established TB biomarkers. Coagulation activation
could not be detected at the primary site of infection in a subset of TB
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary TB is associated with a systemic hypercoagulable state.
