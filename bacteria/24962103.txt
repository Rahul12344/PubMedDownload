Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is 
a dreadful disease common in South-East Asia and Northern Australia and is
characterized by chronic suppurative lesions and pneumonia. Melioidosis may
evolve into severe sepsis with multi-organ failure with high mortalities, despite
proper antibiotic therapy. Besides activation of a strong pro-inflammatory host
response, the coagulation system plays an important role during melioidosis,
which is thought to be host-protective. In particular, a procoagulant state
together with downregulation of anticoagulant pathways and activation of
fibrinolysis are present, all closely interrelated with parameters of
inflammation. This review presents an overview of recent studies in which the
role of coagulation, anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis during melioidosis was
investigated both in patients and in experimental settings.
