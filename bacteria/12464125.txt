INTRODUCTION: Chronic allograft nephropathy is the major cause of long-term graft
failure in human allografted kidney transplantation. In addition to macrophages
and T lymphocytes, mast cells have been shown to increase in chronic allograft
nephropathy. The present study examined tryptase-positive mast cells and
microvessels in the allografted kidney.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 131 biopsy specimens obtained from 100
allografted, 14 non-grafted renal biopsy specimens and nine nephrectomy specimens
due to renal cell carcinomas. Formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded specimens were
immunostained using primary antibodies for mast cell tryptase, mast cell chymase 
and CD34. The number of the mast cells and microvessels was counted in at least
20 high-power fields (10 x 40).
RESULTS: Tryptase-positive mast cells outnumbered chymase, toluidine blue or
naphthol-AS-D choloacetate-positive mast cells. The mean number of the
tryptase-positive mast cells was significantly higher in the 36 specimens with
chronic allograft nephropathy (5.1 +/- 3.5) among the grafted kidneys with other 
disease categories (P < 0.001). In the chronic allograft nephropathy, the mean
numbers of mast cells was significantly higher in Ci 2 + Ci 3 (n = 20; 6.4 +/-
3.89) than in Ci 1 (n = 16; 3.6 +/- 2.65) (P < 0.01). In the non-grafted kidney, 
the number of mast cells was highest in the four specimens with diabetic
nephropathy. Mast cells and microvessels were analysed in the two representative 
cases, which subsequently developed chronic allograft nephropathy. Both of the
cases showed the highest number of mast cells in chronic allograft nephropathy.
In contrast, the mean number of microvessels tended to decrease along with
interstitial fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated clearly a close association between renal
interstitial fibrosis and mast cells, which might play an important role in the
development of chronic allograft nephropathy.
