HLA-linked genetic control of host response to Mycobacterium leprae.

de Vries RR, Fat RF, Nijenhuis LE, van Rood JJ.

Non-random parental HLA-haplotype segregation is demonstrated in siblings with
leprosy. A new method is described for the statistical analysis of non-random
segregation among sibships of different sizes. Sibs with the same type of leprosy
show a significant excess of identical HLA haplotypes. This is also true for
families in which only tuberculoid leprosy is found, which is by far the
commonest type in the population studied. However, sibs affected with different
types of leprosy share a haplotype less often than expected. This indicates that 
both susceptibility to and type of leprosy are controlled by at least two
HLA-linked genes. Our findings suggest that the equivocal results of previous
population studies are due to differences of linkage disequilibrium between
HLA-linked genes controlling the host response to Mycobacterium leprae and
alleles of HLA A and B loci in various populations.
