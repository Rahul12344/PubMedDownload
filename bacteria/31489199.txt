Background: Early recognition of sepsis is challenging, and diagnostic criteria
have changed repeatedly. We assessed the robustness of sepsis-3 criteria in
intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
Methods: We studied the apparent incidence and associated mortality of sepsis-3
among patients who were prospectively enrolled in the Molecular Diagnosis and
Risk Stratification of Sepsis (MARS) cohort in the Netherlands, and explored the 
effects of minor variations in the precise definition and timing of diagnostic
criteria for organ failure.
Results: Among 1081 patients with suspected infection upon ICU admission, 648
(60%) were considered to have sepsis according to prospective adjudication in the
MARS study, whereas 976 (90%) met sepsis-3 criteria, yielding only 64% agreement 
at the individual patient level. Among 501 subjects developing ICU-acquired
infection, these rates were 270 (54%) and 260 (52%), respectively (yielding 58%
agreement). Hospital mortality was 234 (36%) vs 277 (28%) for those meeting
MARS-sepsis or sepsis-3 criteria upon presentation (p < 0.001), and 121 (45%) vs 
103 (40%) for those having sepsis onset in the ICU (p < 0.001). Minor variations 
in timing and interpretation of organ failure criteria had a considerable effect 
on the apparent prevalence of sepsis-3, which ranged from 68 to 96% among those
with infection at admission, and from 22 to 99% among ICU-acquired cases.
Conclusion: The sepsis-3 definition lacks robustness as well as discriminatory
ability, since nearly all patients presenting to ICU with suspected infection
fulfill its criteria. These should therefore be specified in greater detail, and 
applied more consistently, during future sepsis studies.
Trial registration: The MARS study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(identifier NCT01905033).
