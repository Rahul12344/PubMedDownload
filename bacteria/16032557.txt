In the early 1990s, we witnessed a dramatic and relentless increase in
multidrug-resistant pneumococci worldwide. However, there is now evidence of
decreasing resistance to some antimicrobials in some regions of the world. This
may well be a result of several initiatives to promote the judicious use of
antimicrobials, as well as the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine, suggesting that the fight against resistance is maybe not futile.
