Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is an important pathogen involved in serious
nosocomial infections all over the world. Here, we describe the first report on a
blood-stream infection caused by an OXA-48/NDM-1 ST101-KP, in Italy. The patient 
was an Italian woman, transferred from Cairo Hospital to a Neurosurgery ward in
Cuneo (IT). The detection described here enhances the need for an effective
National infection control strategy in Italy.
