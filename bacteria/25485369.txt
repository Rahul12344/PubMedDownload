A matching model based on earth mover's distance for tracking Myxococcus xanthus.

Chen J, Harvey CW, Alber MS, Chen DZ.

Tracking the motion of Myxococcus xanthus is a crucial step for fundamental
bacteria studies. Large number of bacterial cells involved, limited image
resolution, and various cell behaviors (e.g., division) make tracking a highly
challenging problem. A common strategy is to segment the cells first and
associate detected cells into moving trajectories. However, known detection
association algorithms that run in polynomial time are either ineffective to deal
with particular cell behaviors or sensitive to segmentation errors. In this
paper, we propose a polynomial time hierarchical approach for associating
segmented cells, using a new Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) based matching model.
Our method is able to track cell motion when cells may divide, leave/enter the
image window, and the segmentation results may incur false alarm, detection lost,
and falsely merged/split detections. We demonstrate it on tracking M. xanthus.
Applied to error-prone segmented cells, our algorithm exhibits higher track
purity and produces more complete trajectories, comparing to several
state-of-the-art detection association algorithms.
