Lipoproteins (Lpp) of Gram-positive bacteria are major players in alerting our
immune system. Here, we show that the TLR2 response induced by commensal species 
Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis is almost ten times lower
than that induced by noncommensal Staphylococcus carnosus, and this is at least
partially due to their different modifications of the Lpp lipid moieties. The N
terminus of the lipid moiety is acylated with a long-chain fatty acid (C17) in S.
aureus and S. epidermidis, while it is acylated with a short-chain fatty acid
(C2) in S. carnosus. The long-chain N-acylated Lpp, recognized by TLR2-TLR1
receptors, silences innate and adaptive immune responses, while the short-chain
N-acetylated Lpp, recognized by TLR2-TLR6 receptors, boosts it.
