SUMO conjugation is a conserved process of eukaryotes, and essential in metazoa. 
Different isoforms of SUMO are present in eukaryotic genomes. Saccharomyces
cerevisiae has only one SUMO protein, humans have four and Arabidopsis thaliana
has eight, the main isoforms being SUMO1 and SUMO2 with about 95â€‰% identity.
Functionally similar to human SUMO2 and SUMO3, Arabidopsis SUMO1 and 2 can form
chains, even though they do not possess a consensus SUMOylation motif. The
surprising finding that plants have dedicated enzymes for chain synthesis implies
a specific role for SUMO chains in plants. By the cooperative action with SUMO
chain recognizing ubiquitin ligases, chains might channel substrates into the
ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.A method is described to generate SUMO
chains, using plant enzymes produced in E. coli. In vitro SUMO chain formation
may serve for further analysis of SUMO chain functions. It can also provide an
easy-to-synthesize substrate for SUMO-specific proteases.
