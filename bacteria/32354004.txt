The aim of this study was to investigate S. aureus carriage among children with
sickle cell disease (SCD), including the prevalence, risk factors, and antibiotic
resistance. The study was cross-sectional, and involved 120 children with SCD
recruited at the Princess Marie Louise Children's Hospital (PML) in Accra and 100
apparently healthy children from environs of the hospital. Nasal swab samples
were collected from the study participants and cultured for bacteria.
Confirmation of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
isolates were done using the tube coagulase test and mecA polymerase chain
reaction, respectively. All the S. aureus isolates were tested against standard
antimicrobial agents using the Kirby-Bauer method. A structured questionnaire was
used to obtain the socio-demographic and clinical data of the study participants.
Binary logistic regression was used to identify determinants of S. aureus and
MRSA carriage among the study participants. The nasal carriage prevalence of S.
aureus was 33.3% (n = 40) and 10% (n = 10) among the participants of the SCD and 
control groups, respectively. As regards MRSA nasal carriage prevalence, the
respective values were 3.33% (n = 4) and 0.00% (n = 0). SCD was significantly
associated with S. aureus colonization (p < 0.0001, OR = 4.045), but not MRSA
colonization (p = 0.128). In the SCD group, the significant predictors of S.
aureus carriage were increasing age (p = 0.003; OR = 1.275) and living in
self-contained apartments (p = 0.033; OR = 3.632), whereas male gender (p =
0.018; OR = 0.344) and the practice of self-medication (p = 0.039; OR = 0.233)
were protective of S. aureus carriage. In the control group, a history of
hospitalization in the past year was a risk factor for the carriage of S. aureus 
(p = 0.048; OR = 14.333). Among the participants of the SCD and control groups,
respectively, the resistance prevalence recorded by S. aureus against the various
antibiotics investigated were penicillin (100% each), cotrimoxazole (27.5% vs.
20%), tetracycline (25% vs. 50%), rifampicin (82.5% vs. 50%), erythromycin (30%
vs. 20%), clindamycin (32.5% vs. 50%), gentamicin (7.5% vs. 20%), cefoxitin
(27.5% vs. 20%), linezolid (30% vs. 40%), and fusidic acid (95% vs. 80%). The
proportion of S. aureus isolates that were multidrug resistant (MDR) was 92.5%
(37/40) in the SCD group and 100% (10/10) in the control group.
