The peripheral B cell compartment in mice and humans is maintained by continuous 
production of transitional B cells in the bone marrow. In other species, however,
including rabbits, B lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow abates early in life, and
it is unclear how the peripheral B cell compartment is maintained. We identified 
transitional B cells in rabbits and classified them into T1 (CD24(high)CD21(low))
and T2 (CD24(high)CD21(+)) B cell subsets. By neutralizing B cell-activating
factor in vivo, we found an arrest in peripheral B cell development at the T1 B
cell stage. Surprisingly, T1 B cells were present in GALT, blood, and spleen of
adult rabbits, long after B lymphopoiesis was arrested. T1 B cells were distinct 
from their counterparts in other species because they are proliferating and the
Ig genes are somatically diversified. We designate these newly described cells as
T1d B cells and propose a model in which they develop in GALT, self renew,
continuously differentiate into mature B cells, and thereby maintain peripheral B
cell homeostasis in adults in the absence of B lymphopoiesis.
