Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and its severe condition with extensive skin
detachment and a poor prognosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are
immunologically mediated severe cutaneous reactions of the skin and mucous
membranes such as the ocular surface. Genetic variations on the HLA-A and other
autosomal genes have been identified as risk factors for cold medicine-related
SJS/TEN with severe ocular complications (CM-SJS/TEN with SOC). Using a
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach, we explored other susceptible variants of
CM-SJS/TEN with SOC, especially among rare variants and structural variants
(SVs). WGS was performed on samples from 133 patients with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC
and 418 healthy controls to obtain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
SVs. Genome-wide association tests were performed with these variants. Our
genome-wide association test reproduced the associations of the common variants
of HLA-A and loci on chromosome 16q12.1. We also identified novel associations of
SVs on these loci and an aggregation of rare coding variants on the TPRM8 gene.
In silico gene expression analysis on the HLA-A locus revealed that the SNP
(rs12202296), which was significantly associated with susceptibility to
CM-SJS/TEN with SOC, was correlated to an increase in HLA-A expression levels in 
the whole blood (P = 2.9 × 10-17), from the GTEx database. The majority of
variants that were significantly associated with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC were found
in non-coding regions, indicating the regulatory role of genetic variations in
the pathogenesis of CM-SJS/TEN with SOC.
