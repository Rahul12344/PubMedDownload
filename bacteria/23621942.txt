Investigation of an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in a primary school in Milan,
Italy, found 15 schoolchildren had active TB disease and 173 had latent TB
infection. TB was also identified in 2 homeless men near the school. Diagnostic
delay, particularly in the index case-patient, contributed to the transmission of
infection.
