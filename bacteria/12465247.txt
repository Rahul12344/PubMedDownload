We describe a system capable of measuring the laser induced fluorescence emission
of two coenzymes (NADH and FAD) via an optical fibre for in vivo monitoring of
anatomical, physiological or pathological changes in biological systems. This
optical technique permits the measurement of changes in the metabolism of cells
in real-time and is nearly non-destructive. We present results of examinations on
the localisation of transitions between different tissue and the monitoring of
the oxygenation level (ischemia) in muscle or changes in the cellular activity of
bacteria in a bioreactor.
