Orthodontic brackets made from stainless steel were introduced in dentistry,
though they have less ability in reducing enamel demineralization and are not
successful in preventing microbial as well as biofilm growth. In this study, we
evaluated the significant role of different brackets in reducing enamel
demineralization indirectly. Results from different tests indicate the
significant reduction in adhesion, biofilm formation and slow growth of tested
bacterial species on brackets coated with Ag + TiO2 and found to be statistically
significant lower than control. There was no loss in cell viability in all
brackets indicating that the cells are biocompatible with different bracket
materials. Scanning electron microscopy showed less bacteria attached with the
surface coated with Ag + TiO2 indicated that bacteria were losing adherent nature
on coated surface. In conclusion, TiO2+Ag coating on stainless steel brackets
possessed anti-adherent properties and also have demonstrable antibacterial
properties therefore helps in preventing dental caries and plaque accumulation
indirectly. The cell compatibility of TiO2+Ag coated brackets is superior to the 
uncoated samples therefore can be used in orthodontics as it not only provide
suitable antimicrobial activity and resistance to biofilm formation but also
sustained the cell viability of human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cell lines.
