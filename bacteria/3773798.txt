[Relationship of gastric aspirate fluid examination to infections in the newborn 
infant in cases of premature rupture of the membranes].

[Article in Turkish]

OÄŸuz A, Bakici MZ.

In fifty newborn babies, gastric aspirate fluids obtained during the one-hour
post partum period were examined from the stand point of PML and cultures. A
susceptibility to infections (especially lung infections and sepsis) were
established in 8 (30.8%) out of 26 cases with EMR more than twelve hours. PML
counts of these cases were 13 and more than 13 per high power field. Significant 
differences were found between the babies with and without EMR, from the
point-of-view of PML count in gastric aspirate fluid and the increased incidence 
of infections (p less than 0.05).
