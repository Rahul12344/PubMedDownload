A 37-year-old man developed Henoch--Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) with
nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis after otitis media 
and externa due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Despite
resolution of the infection and prednisolone therapy, his kidney disease
worsened. However, the addition of cyclosporine A finally resulted in complete
remission of the nephrotic syndrome. A review of similar cases with
post-Staphylococcal infection HSPN revealed strong similarities between this
entity and immunoglobulin A-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis
(IgA-PIGN), an increasingly recognized form of PIGN typically associated with
Staphylococcal infection, in both clinical and morphological features.
Post-Staphylococcal infection HSPN may constitute a subgroup of IgA-PIGN.
