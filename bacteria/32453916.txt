Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging
malignancies. Desmoplasia and tumor-supporting inflammation are hallmarks of
PDAC. The tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor progression
and spread. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) facilitate therapy resistance
and metastasis. Recent reports emphasized the concurrence of multiple subtypes of
CAFs with diverse roles, fibrogenic, and secretory. C-X-C motif chemokine
receptor 2 (CXCR2) is a chemokine receptor known for its role during inflammation
and its adverse role in PDAC. Oncogenic Kras upregulates CXCR2 and its ligands
and, thus, contribute to tumor proliferation and immunosuppression. CXCR2
deletion in a PDAC syngeneic mouse model produced increased fibrosis revealing a 
potential undescribed role of CXCR2 in CAFs. In this study, we demonstrate that
the oncogenic Kras-CXCR2 axis regulates the CAFs function in PDAC and contributes
to CAFs heterogeneity. We observed that oncogenic Kras and CXCR2 signaling alter 
CAFs, producing a secretory CAF phenotype with low fibrogenic features; and
increased secretion of pro-tumor cytokines and CXCR2 ligands, utilizing the NF-κB
activity. Finally, using syngeneic mouse models, we demonstrate that oncogenic
Kras is associated with secretory CAFs and that CXCR2 inhibition promotes
activation of fibrotic cells (myofibroblasts) and impact tumors in a
mutation-dependent manner.
