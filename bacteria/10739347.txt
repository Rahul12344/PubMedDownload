This study demonstrated that atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to obtain 
high-resolution topographical images of bacteria, and to quantify the tip-cell
interaction force and the surface elasticity. Results show that the adhesion
force between the Si3N4 tip and the bacteria surface was in the range from -3.9
to -4.3 nN. On the other hand, the adhesion forces at the periphery of the
cell-substratum contact surface ranged from -5.1 to -5.9 nN and those at the
cell-cell interface ranged from -6.5 to -6.8 nN. The two latter forces were
considerably greater than the former one, most likely due to the accumulation of 
extracellular polymer substance (EPS). Results also show that the elasticity
varied on the cell surface.
