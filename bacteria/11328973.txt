The authors have described the issues surrounding Listeria monocytogenes
infection with reference to cases diagnosed and managed during the 5-year period 
(1995-2000) in the Clinical Department of Neonatal Pathology and Intensive Care
of the National Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. Four cases of congenital
listeriosis have been diagnosed. Some mothers presented with "flu-like" symptoms.
All mothers delivered prematurely (29 hbd - 32 hbd). Among the 4 infants the most
common clinical features were: perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress,
pathological icterus, haematologic abnormalities. Septicemia occurred in 50% of
cases; pneumonia in 100%. Three of them presented skin manifestations; one of the
neonates had mucosal abnormalities of the laryngopharynx. Cerebral sonography
showed intracranial hemorrhage. One of the infants died within 7 days of birth.
The other two neonates developed posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Only one infant
has normal development. Although listeriosis appears to be not a frequent cause
of perinatal infection, clinicians must be aware of Listeria, particularly in
gravid patients who present with fever and "flu-like" illness and go into
premature labour. Initial therapy implemented in our Department, with ampicillin 
and aminoglycosides seem to be the most appropriate.
