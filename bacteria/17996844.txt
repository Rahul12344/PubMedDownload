OBJECTIVE: Aberrant matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and human beta-defensin (HBD) 
functions have been found in inflammatory diseases. The objectives of this study 
were to investigate the immunolocalisation, mRNA expression and molecular forms
of MMP-25, MMP-26, HBD-1 and HBD-2 in chronic and aggressive periodontitis and in
peri-implantitis. The expression of MMP-25 by cultured human plasmacytoma cells
and macrophages, and the effects of MMP-26 and Porphyromonas gingivalis
trypsin-like proteinase on HBD-1 and -2 were also studied.
DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescent analysis, reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting were used to assess localisation,
mRNA expression and molecular forms of MMP-25, MMP-26, HBD-1 and HBD-2. HBD
degradation by MMP-26 and P. gingivalis proteinase was studied by sodium dodecyl 
sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: MMP-25 was present in plasma cells and polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and
MMP-26 was present in oral and sulcular basement membrane zones. HBD-1 was
distributed perivasculary in gingival connective tissue and in oral and sulcular 
epithelium, and HBD-2 was found to a lesser extent in the perivascular space. Low
MMP-25, MMP-26, HBD-1 and HBD-2 mRNA expression was found. Immunoblot revealed
29-57-kDa MMP-25 in myeloma cell lysates, but not in macrophages, and partly
activated MMP-25 and -26 in diseased gingival crevicular fluid and peri-implant
sulcular fluid. P. gingivalis trypsin-like proteinase degraded HBD-1 and -2.
CONCLUSIONS: Both MMP-25 and -26 were expressed more strongly in extensively
inflamed gingiva compared with healthy gingiva. The expression of HBD-1 was
stronger than that of HBD-2 in periodontitis and peri-implantitis. De-novo
expression of MMP-25 and -26 is associated with periodontal and peri-implant
inflammation. Furthermore, P. gingivalis trypsin-like proteinase, but not MMP-26,
can degrade HBD-1 and -2, which could lead to a weakened innate immune response.
