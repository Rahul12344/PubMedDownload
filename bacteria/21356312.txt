The vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multi-subunit proton pump that is
involved in both intra- and extracellular acidification processes throughout
human body. Subunits constituting the peripheral stalk of the V-ATPase are known 
to have several isoforms responsible for tissue/cell specific different
physiological roles. To study the different interaction of these isoforms, we
expressed and purified the isoforms of human V-ATPase peripheral stalk subunits
using Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis system: E1, E2, G1, G2, G3,
C1, C2, H and N-terminal soluble part of a1 and a2 isoforms. The purification
conditions were different depending on the isoforms, maybe reflecting the isoform
specific biochemical characteristics. The purified proteins are expected to
facilitate further experiments to study about the cell specific interaction and
regulation and thus provide insight into physiological meaning of the existence
of several isoforms of each subunit in V-ATPase.
