BACKGROUND: Melioidosis is a frequent cause of sepsis in Southeast Asia caused by
the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Patients with melioidosis 
have elevated circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1
(PAI-1), an important regulator of inflammation and fibrinolysis.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of PAI-1 during
melioidosis.
METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and PAI-1-deficient (PAI-1-/1(-/-) ) mice were
intranasally infected with B. pseudomallei. Mice were killed after 24, 48 or 72
h. Lungs, liver and blood were harvested for measurement of bacterial loads,
cytokines, clinical chemistry, histopathology, and coagulation parameters.
Additionally, survival studies were performed.
RESULTS: PAI-1(-/-) mice demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to B. pseudomallei 
infection, as shown by a strongly increased mortality rate (100% vs. 58% among WT
mice, P < 0.001), associated with enhanced bacterial loads in lungs, liver, and
blood. Additionally, PAI-1(-/-) mice showed elevated levels of proinflammatory
cytokines in lungs and plasma, accompanied by enhanced local and systemic
coagulation activation (thrombin-antithrombin complexes and D-dimer), increased
hepatocellular injury (plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase), and renal failure (plasma creatinine and urea).
CONCLUSIONS: PAI-1 has a protective role during severe Gram-negative sepsis
caused by B. pseudomallei by limiting bacterial growth, inflammation, and
coagulation, and probably, as a consequence thereof, distant organ injury.
