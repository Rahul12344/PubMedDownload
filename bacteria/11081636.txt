The Listeria monocytogenes surface protein InlB promotes bacterial entry into
mammalian cells. Here, we identify a cellular surface receptor required for
InlB-mediated entry. Treatment of mammalian cells with InlB protein or infection 
with L. monocytogenes induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Met, a receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) for which the only known ligand is Hepatocyte Growth Factor
(HGF). Like HGF, InlB binds to the extracellular domain of Met and induces
"scattering" of epithelial cells. Experiments with Met-positive and Met-deficient
cell lines demonstrate that Met is required for InlB-dependent entry of L.
monocytogenes. InlB is a novel Met agonist that induces bacterial entry through
exploitation of a host RTK pathway.
