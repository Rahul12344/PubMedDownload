In recent years, much attention has been paid to physiological functions of foods
due to increasing concerns for health. Although there has been limited
information of physiological functions of meat until recently, several attractive
meat-based bioactive compounds, such as carnosine, anserine, l-carnitine,
conjugated linoleic acid, have been studied. Emphasizing these activities is one 
possible approach for improving the health image of meat and developing
functional meat products. This article provides potential benefits of
representative meat-based bioactive compounds on human health and an overview of 
meat-based functional products. Strategies for designing novel functional meat
products utilizing bioactive peptides and/or probiotic bacteria, is also
discussed. This article focuses particularly on the possibility of meat
protein-derived bioactive peptides, such as antihypertensive peptides. There are 
still some hurdles in developing and marketing novel functional meat products
since such products are unconventional and consumers in many countries recognize 
meat and meat products to be bad for health. Along with accumulation of
scientific data, there is an urgent need to inform consumers of the exact
functional value of meat and meat products including novel functional foods.
