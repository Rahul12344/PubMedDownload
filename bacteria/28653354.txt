BACKGROUND: The total nucleated cell dosage of umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an
important factor in determining successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation after a minimum human leukocyte antigen donor-recipient match.
The northern South American population is in need of a new-generation cord blood 
bank that cryopreserves only units with high total nucleated cell content,
thereby increasing the likelihood of use. Colombia set up a public cord blood
bank in 2014; and, as a result of its research for improving high total nucleated
cell content, a new strategy for UCB collection was developed.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 2933 collected and 759 cryopreserved cord
blood units between 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. The correlation of donor and
collection variables with cellularity was evaluated. Moreover, blood volume, cell
content, CD34+ count, clonogenic capacity, and microbial contamination were
assessed comparing the new method, which combines in utero and ex utero
techniques, with the conventional strategies.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis confirmed a correlation between neonatal birth
weight and cell content. The new collection method increased total nucleated cell
content in approximately 26% and did not alter pre-cryopreservation and post-thaw
cell recovery, viability, or clonogenic ability. Furthermore, it showed a
remarkably low microbial contamination rate (1.2%).
CONCLUSION: The strategy for UCB collection developed at the first Colombian
public cord blood bank increases total nucleated cell content and does not affect
unit quality. The existence of this bank is a remarkable breakthrough for
Latin-American patients in need of this kind of transplantation.
