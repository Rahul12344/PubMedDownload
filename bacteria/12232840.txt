CD8(+) T cells could make an important contribution to protection against
tuberculosis (TB), but the antigenic determinants recognized in the context of
major histocompatibility complex class I molecules remain ill defined. Our aim
was to identify nonamer peptides derived from the acr/16-kDa antigen. Two
immunogenic peptides (p21-29 and p120-128) were identified by their ability to
elicit cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells from juvenile patients recovering from TB.
Epitope-specific recognition was demonstrated by the lysis of both Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis-infected and peptide-pulsed macrophages, the release of cytotoxic
granules, and interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. CD8(+)
T cell responses to p21-29 and p120-128 were detected ex vivo in freshly isolated
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with TB but not in those from
healthy control subjects. Our data suggest that these antigenic peptides can play
a critical role in effective immunity against mycobacterial infection and TB.
