Comment in
    Sci Immunol. 2018 Feb 2;3(20):.

The immune system can mount T cell responses against tumors; however, the antigen
specificities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are not well understood.
We used yeast-display libraries of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) to
screen for antigens of "orphan" T cell receptors (TCRs) expressed on TILs from
human colorectal adenocarcinoma. Four TIL-derived TCRs exhibited strong selection
for peptides presented in a highly diverse pHLA-A∗02:01 library. Three of the TIL
TCRs were specific for non-mutated self-antigens, two of which were present in
separate patient tumors, and shared specificity for a non-mutated self-antigen
derived from U2AF2. These results show that the exposed recognition surface of
MHC-bound peptides accessible to the TCR contains sufficient structural
information to enable the reconstruction of sequences of peptide targets for
pathogenic TCRs of unknown specificity. This finding underscores the surprising
specificity of TCRs for their cognate antigens and enables the facile
indentification of tumor antigens through unbiased screening.
