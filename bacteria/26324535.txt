Serratia marcescens is a soil- and water-derived bacterium that secretes several 
host-directed factors and causes hospital infections and community-acquired
ocular infections. The putative two-component regulatory system composed of EepR 
and EepS regulates hemolysis and swarming motility through transcriptional
control of the swrW gene and pigment production through control of the pigA-pigN 
operon. Here, we identify and characterize a role for EepR in regulation of
exoenzyme production, stress survival, cytotoxicity to human epithelial cells,
and virulence. Genetic analysis supports the model that EepR is in a common
pathway with the widely conserved cyclic-AMP receptor protein that regulates
protease production. Together, these data introduce a novel regulator of
host-pathogen interactions and secreted-protein production.
