The two putative ars operons in Alkaliphilus metalliredigens QYMF are distinctive
in that the arsA gene is split in halves, amarsA1 and amarsA2, and, acr3 but not 
an arsB gene coexists with arsA. Heterologous expression of one of the A.
metalliredigensars operons (ars1) conferred arsenite but not antimonite
resistance to DeltaarsEscherichia coli. Only the co-expressed AmArsA1 and AmArsA2
displayed arsenite or antimonite stimulated ATPase activity. The results show
that AmArsA1-AmArsA2 interaction is needed to form the functional ArsA ATPase.
This novel AmArsA1-AmArsA2 complex may provide insight in how it participates
with Acr3 in arsenite detoxification.
