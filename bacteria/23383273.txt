Previous studies have demonstrated that valosin-containing protein (VCP) is
associated with H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis. By identifying the
interactome of VCP overexpressed in AGS cells using a subtractive proteomics
approach, we aimed to characterize the cellular responses mediated by VCP and its
functional roles in H. pylori-associated gastric cancer. VCP immunoprecipitations
followed by proteomic analysis identified 288 putative interacting proteins, 18
VCP-binding proteins belonged to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. H. pylori
infection increased the interaction between Akt and VCP, Akt-dependent
phosphorylation of VCP, levels of ubiquitinated proteins, and aggresome formation
in AGS cells. Furthermore, phosphorylated VCP co-localized with the aggresome,
bound ubiquitinated proteins, and increased the degradation of cellular
regulators to protect H. pylori-infected AGS cells from apoptosis. Our study
demonstrates that VCP phosphorylation following H. pylori infection promotes both
gastric epithelial cell survival, mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway, and the
degradation of cellular regulators. These findings provide novel insights into
the mechanisms of H. pylori infection induced gastric carcinogenesis.
