This study examined the oral epithelial immunotranscriptome response patterns
modulated by oral bacterial planktonic or biofilm challenge. We assessed gene
expression patterns when epithelial cells were challenged with a multispecies
biofilm composed of Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and
Porphyromonas gingivalis representing a type of periodontopathic biofilm compared
to challenge with the same species of planktonic bacteria. Of the 579 human
immunology genes, a substantial signal of the epithelial cells was observed to
181 genes. Biofilm challenged stimulated significant elevations compared to
planktonic bacteria for IL32, IL8, CD44, B2M, TGFBI, NFKBIA, IL1B, CD59, IL1A,
CCL20 representing the top 10 signals comprising 55% of the overall signal for
the epithelial cell responses. Levels of PLAU, CD9, IFITM1, PLAUR, CD24, TNFSF10,
and IL1RN were all elevated by each of the planktonic bacterial challenge vs the 
biofilm responses. While the biofilms up-regulated 123/579 genes (>2-fold), fewer
genes were increased by the planktonic species (36 [S gordonii], 30 [F
nucleatum], 44 [P gingivalis]). A wide array of immune genes were regulated by
oral bacterial challenge of epithelial cells that would be linked to the local
activity of innate and adaptive immune response components in the gingival
tissues. Incorporating bacterial species into a structured biofilm dramatically
altered the number and level of genes expressed. Additionally, a specific set of 
genes were significantly decreased with the multispecies biofilms suggesting that
some epithelial cell biologic pathways are down-regulated when in contact with
this type of pathogenic biofilm.
