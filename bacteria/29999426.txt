INTRODUCTION: MUC16 is overexpressed in multiple cancers and plays an important
role in tumorigenicity and acquired resistance to therapy. Area covered: In this 
review, we describe the role of MUC16 under normal physiological conditions and
during tumorigenesis. First, we provide a summary of research on MUC16 from its
discovery as CA125 to present anti-MUC16 therapy trials that are currently in the
initial phases of clinical testing. Finally, we discuss the reasons for the
limited effectiveness of these therapies and discuss the direction and focus of
future research. Expert opinion: Apart from its protective role in normal
physiology, MUC16 contributes to disease progression and metastasis in several
malignancies. Due to its aberrant overexpression, it is a promising target for
diagnosis and therapy. Cleavage and shedding of its extracellular domain is the
major barrier for efficient targeting of MUC16-expressing cancers. Concerted
efforts should be undertaken to target the noncleaved cell surface retained
portion of MUC16. Such efforts should be accompanied by basic research to
understand MUC16 cleavage and decipher the functioning of MUC16 cytoplasmic tail.
While previous efforts to activate anti-MUC16 immune response using anti-CA125
idiotype antibodies have met with limited success, ideification of neo-antigenic 
epitopes in MUC16 that correlate with improved survival have raised raised hopes 
for developing MUC16-targeted immunotherapy.
