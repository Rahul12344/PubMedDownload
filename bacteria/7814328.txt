The arsA and arsB genes of the ars operon of R-factor R773 confer arsenite
resistance in Escherichia coli by coding for an anion-translocating ATPase.
Arsenite resistance and the in vivo energetics of arsenite transport were
compared in cells expressing the arsA and arsB genes and those expressing just
the arsB gene. Cells expressing the arsB gene exhibited intermediate arsenite
resistance compared with cells expressing both the arsA and arsB genes. Both
types of cells exhibited energy-dependent arsenite exclusion. Exclusion of
73AsO2- from cells expressing only the arsB gene was coupled to electrochemical
energy, while in cells expressing both genes, transport was coupled to chemical
energy, most likely ATP. These results suggest that the Ars anion transport
system can be either an obligatory ATP-coupled primary pump or a secondary
carrier coupled to the proton motive force, depending on the subunit composition 
of the transport complex.
