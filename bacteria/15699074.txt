Lipid raft membrane compartmentalization and membrane-associated guanylate kinase
(MAGUK) family molecular scaffolds function in establishing cell polarity and
organizing signal transducers within epithelial cell junctions and neuronal
synapses. Here, we elucidate a role for the MAGUK protein, Dlgh1, in polarized T 
cell synapse assembly and T cell function. We find that Dlgh1 translocates to the
immune synapse and lipid rafts in response to T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28
engagement and that LckSH3-mediated interactions with Dlgh1 control its membrane 
targeting. TCR/CD28 engagement induces the formation of endogenous
Lck-Dlgh1-Zap70-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) complexes in which Dlgh1 
acts to facilitate interactions of Lck with Zap70 and WASp. Using small
interfering RNA and overexpression approaches, we show that Dlgh1 promotes
antigen-induced actin polymerization, synaptic raft and TCR clustering, nuclear
factor of activated T cell activity, and cytokine production. We propose that
Dlgh1 coordinates TCR/CD28-induced actin-driven T cell synapse assembly, signal
transduction, and effector function. These findings highlight common molecular
strategies used to regulate cell polarity, synapse assembly, and transducer
organization in diverse cellular systems.
