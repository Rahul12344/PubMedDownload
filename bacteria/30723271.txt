Hepatocarcinogenesis is tightly linked to liver fibrosis. Recently, two GWAS
variants, MICA rs2596542 and DEPDC5 rs1012068 were identified as being associated
with the development of HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japanese
patients. The role of these variants on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis that
are closely associated with HCC development is not known, nor are the biological 
mechanisms underlying their impact on the liver. Here, we demonstrate in 1689
patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (1,501 with CHC and 188 with HCV-related 
HCC), that the MICA (T) allele, despite not being associated with HCC
susceptibility, is associated with increased fibrosis stage (OR: 1.47, 95% CI:
1.05-2.06, p = 0.02) and fibrosis progression rate (hazards ratio: 1.41, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.90, p = 0.02). The DEPDC5 variant was not associated with any of these
phenotypes. MICA expression was down-regulated in advanced fibrosis stages.
Further, (T) allele carriage was associated with lower MICA expression in liver
and serum. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression suppresses MICA
expression in hepatic stellate cells. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism
linking susceptibility to advanced fibrosis and subsequently indirectly to HCC,
to the level of MICA expression through TGF-β1-dependent mechanisms.
