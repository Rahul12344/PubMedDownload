Significant resources are invested into efforts to improve the production yields 
of natural products from Actinobacteria, a well-recognized source of leads for
several industries, most notably pharmaceutical one. Introduction of changes into
genes for ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL) and/or 16S rRNA methylation (rsmG) is one 
of traditional approaches (referred to as ribosomal engineering) towards
actinobacterial strain improvement. Yet, true potential of ribosome engineering
remains unknown as it is currently coupled to empirical selection for
aminoglycoside-resistance; rpsL mutations without such phenotypic expression
could not be isolated. Here, we report a systematic and rational ribosome
engineering approach to study the effect of a range of rpsL mutations on the
production level of different biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC). The severe effect
of diverse rpsL mutations together with deletion of rsmG engineered in
Streptomyces albus has been revealed on the transcription level of several
indigenous BGCs. The aforementioned mutations strongly impacted the transcription
of indigenous BGCs, possibly because they alter the transcription of BGC-situated
and global regulatory genes. The rsmG deletion with certain rpsL mutations can
have a synergistic effect on the transcription level of indigenous BGCs. Our work
thus provides the first streptomycete platform for rational engineering and study
of virtually any nonlethal rpsL mutation. The tremendous effect of ribosome
engineering on the transcription profile of the strains was reported for the
first time. A library of described S. albus rpsL*/ΔrsmG strains represents a
useful tool for overproducing known secondary metabolites and activating silent
biosynthetic gene clusters in Actinobacteria.
