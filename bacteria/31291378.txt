Somatic mutations in cancer are a potential source of cancer specific
neoantigens. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has common recurrent mutations shared
between patients in addition to private mutations specific to individuals. We
hypothesized that neoantigens derived from recurrent shared mutations would be
attractive targets for future immunotherapeutic approaches. Here we sought to
study the HLA Class I and II immunopeptidome of thirteen primary AML tumor
samples and two AML cell lines (OCI-AML3 and MV4-11) using mass spectrometry to
evaluate for endogenous mutation-bearing HLA ligands from common shared AML
mutations. We identified two endogenous, mutation-bearing HLA Class I ligands
from nucleophosmin (NPM1). The ligands, AVEEVSLRK from two patient samples and
C(cys)LAVEEVSL from OCI-AML3, are predicted to bind the common HLA haplotypes,
HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*02:01 respectively. Since NPM1 is mutated in approximately 
one-third of patients with AML, the finding of endogenous HLA ligands from
mutated NPM1 supports future studies evaluating immunotherapeutic approaches
against this shared target, for this subset of patients with AML.
