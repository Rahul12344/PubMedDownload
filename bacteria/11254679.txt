TCR aggregation at the point of contact with an APC is thought to play an
important role in T cell signal transduction. However, this potentially important
phenomenon has never been documented during an immune response in vivo. Here we
used immunohistology to show that the TCR on naive Ag-specific CD4 T cells in the
lymph nodes of mice injected with Ag redistributed to one side of the cell. In
cases where the APC could be identified, the TCR was concentrated on the side of 
the T cell facing the APC. In those T cells that produced IL-2, the TCR and IL-2 
localized to the same side of the cell. In vivo IL-2 production depended on
costimulatory signaling through CD28, whereas TCR redistribution did not. These
results show that Ag-stimulated CD4 T cells produce IL-2 in a polarized fashion
and undergo CD28-independent TCR redistribution in vivo.
