2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloro-ethylene (DDE) is the most abundant and
persistent degradation product of the pesticide
2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) and is encountered in
contaminated soils worldwide. Both DDE and DDT are classified as Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POPs) due to their high hydrophobicity and potential for
bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the food chain. Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo 
ssp. pepo) has been shown to accumulate high concentrations of DDE and other POPs
and has been proposed as a phytoremediation tool for contaminated soils. The
endophytic bacteria associated with this plant may play an important role in the 
remedial process. Therefore, this research focuses on changes in endophytic
bacterial communities caused by the exposure of C. pepo to DDE. The total
bacterial community was investigated using cultivation-independent 454
pyrosequencing, while the cultivable community was identified using
cultivation-dependent isolation procedures. For both procedures, increasing
numbers of endophytic bacteria, as well as higher diversities of genera were
observed when plants were exposed to DDE. Several bacterial genera such as
Stenotrophomonas sp. and Sphingomonas sp. showed higher abundance when DDE was
present, while, for example Pseudomonas sp. showed a significantly lower
abundance in the presence of DDE. These findings suggest tolerance of different
bacterial strains to DDE, which might be incorporated in further investigations
to optimize phytoremediation with the possible use of DDE-degrading endophytes.
