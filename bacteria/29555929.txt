This study assessed the effects of crystalloid versus synthetic colloid in vitro 
on immune cells co-cultured with mouse splenocytes. Mouse splenocytes were
co-cultured with three different types of fluid: Plasma solution-A® (CJ
HealthCare, Seoul, Korea; the crystalloid group); Tetraspan 6%® (B. Braun
Medical, Melsungen, Germany; the Colloid-T group); and Volulyte 6%® (Fresenius
Kabi, Bad Homburg vor dér-Höhe, Germany; Colloid-V group). To evaluate the
acquired immune response, cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T cells and CD8+ T
cells were measured. To evaluate the innate immune response, neutrophils were
measured. The frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not differ significantly
among the three groups on day 1 or 3. However, the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells in the two synthetic colloid groups were significantly higher than those in
the crystalloid group on day 7. On day 1, the frequency of neutrophils was
significantly lower in the two synthetic colloid groups, compared with the
crystalloid group. However, the values on the other days were similar among all
three groups. In conclusion, crystalloid had a limited effect on the immune
response; on the other hand, synthetic colloid increased the acquired immune
response, although it temporarily inhibited the innate immune response.
