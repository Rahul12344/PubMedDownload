The immunosuppressive activity of myriocin (ISP-1), a lead compound of fingolimod
(FTY720), is derived from its 2-amino-1,3-propandiol structure. A
non-proteinogenic amino acid, (2S,6R)-diamino-(5R,7)-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid
(DADH), that contains this structure, was recently identified as a biosynthetic
intermediate of a dipeptide secondary metabolite, vazabitide A, in Streptmyces
sp. SANK 60404; however its effect on adaptive immunity has not yet been
examined. In this study, we examined whether DADH suppresses mixed lymphocyte
reaction using mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and allogeneic
splenic T cells. Although T cell proliferation induced by cross-linking CD3 and
CD28 were not suppressed by DADH unlike ISP-1, the pre-incubation of BMDCs with
DADH but not ISP-1 significantly decreased allogeneic CD8+ T cell expansion.
Based on these results, we concluded that DADH suppresses DC-mediated T cell
activation by targeting DCs.
