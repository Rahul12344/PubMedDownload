SUMOylation is involved in the development of several inflammatory diseases, but 
the physiological significance of SUMO-modulated c-Maf in autoimmune diabetes is 
not completely understood. Here, we report that an age-dependent attenuation of
c-Maf SUMOylation in CD4+ T cells is positively correlated with the
IL-21-mediated diabetogenesis in NOD mice. Using 2 strains of T cell-specific
transgenic NOD mice overexpressing wild-type c-Maf (Tg-WTc) or SUMOylation
site-mutated c-Maf (Tg-KRc), we demonstrated that Tg-KRc mice developed diabetes 
more rapidly than Tg-WTc mice in a CD4+ T cell-autonomous manner. Moreover,
SUMO-defective c-Maf preferentially transactivated Il21 to promote the
development of CD4+ T cells with an extrafollicular helper T cell phenotype and
expand the numbers of granzyme B-producing effector/memory CD8+ T cells.
Furthermore, SUMO-defective c-Maf selectively inhibited recruitment of Daxx/HDAC2
to the Il21 promoter and enhanced histone acetylation mediated by CREB-binding
protein (CBP) and p300. Using pharmacological interference with CBP/p300, we
illustrated that CBP30 treatment ameliorated c-Maf-mediated/IL-21-based
diabetogenesis. Taken together, our results show that the SUMOylation status of
c-Maf has a stronger regulatory effect on IL-21 than the level of c-Maf
expression, through an epigenetic mechanism. These findings provide new insights 
into how SUMOylation modulates the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes in a T
cell-restricted manner and on the basis of a single transcription factor.
