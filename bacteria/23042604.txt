E3-19K binds to and retains MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum,
suppressing anti-adenovirus activities of T cells. We determined the structure of
the adenovirus serotype 2 (Ad2, species C) E3-19K-HLA-A2 complex to 1.95-Å
resolution. Ad2 E3-19K binds to the N terminus of the HLA-A2 groove, contacting
the α1, α2 and α3 domains and β(2)m. Ad2 E3-19K has a unique structure comprising
a large N-terminal domain, formed by two partially overlapping β-sheets arranged 
in a V shape, and a C-terminal α-helix and tail. The structure reveals
determinants in E3-19K and HLA-A2 that are important for complex formation;
conservation of some of these determinants in E3-19K proteins of different
species and MHC I molecules of different loci suggests a universal binding mode
for all E3-19K proteins. Our structure is important for understanding the
immunomodulatory function of E3-19K.
