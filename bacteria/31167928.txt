Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), a
monogenic disorder caused by AIRE mutations, presents with several autoimmune
diseases. Among these, endocrine organ failure is widely recognized, but the
prevalence, immunopathogenesis, and treatment of non-endocrine manifestations
such as pneumonitis remain poorly characterized. We enrolled 50 patients with
APECED in a prospective observational study and comprehensively examined their
clinical and radiographic findings, performed pulmonary function tests, and
analyzed immunological characteristics in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
and endobronchial and lung biopsies. Pneumonitis was found in >40% of our
patients, presented early in life, was misdiagnosed despite chronic respiratory
symptoms and accompanying radiographic and pulmonary function abnormalities, and 
caused hypoxemic respiratory failure and death. Autoantibodies against BPIFB1 and
KCNRG and the homozygous c.967_979del13 AIRE mutation are associated with
pneumonitis development. APECED pneumonitis features compartmentalized
immunopathology, with accumulation of activated neutrophils in the airways and
lymphocytic infiltration in intraepithelial, submucosal, peribronchiolar, and
interstitial areas. Beyond APECED, we extend these observations to lung disease
seen in other conditions with secondary AIRE deficiency (thymoma and RAG
deficiency). Aire-deficient mice had similar compartmentalized cellular immune
responses in the airways and lung tissue, which was ameliorated by deficiency of 
T and B lymphocytes. Accordingly, T and B lymphocyte-directed immunomodulation
controlled symptoms and radiographic abnormalities and improved pulmonary
function in patients with APECED pneumonitis. Collectively, our findings unveil
lung autoimmunity as a common, early, and unrecognized manifestation of APECED
and provide insights into the immunopathogenesis and treatment of pulmonary
autoimmunity associated with impaired central immune tolerance.
