Natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes deploy perforin and granzymes to
kill infected host cells. Perforin, secreted by immune cells, binds target
membranes to form pores that deliver pro-apoptotic granzymes into the target
cell. A crucial first step in this process is interaction of its C2 domain with
target cell membranes, which is a calcium-dependent event. Some aspects of this
process are understood, but many molecular details remain unclear. To address
this, we investigated the mechanism of Ca(2+) and lipid binding to the C2 domain 
by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. Calcium titrations, together with 
dodecylphosphocholine micelle experiments, confirmed that multiple Ca(2+) ions
bind within the calcium-binding regions, activating perforin with respect to
membrane binding. We have also determined the affinities of several of these
binding sites and have shown that this interaction causes a significant
structural rearrangement in CBR1. Thus, it is proposed that Ca(2+) binding at the
weakest affinity site triggers changes in the C2 domain that facilitate its
interaction with lipid membranes.
