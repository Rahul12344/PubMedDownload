We aimed to determine the prebiotic impact of Mushroom Bulgaria inquinans (BI) on
the host immune response and gut microbiota. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet
supplemented with 0, 1, or 2% BI for 4 wks. Compared to mice fed with a control
diet (0% BI), mice fed with 1 or 2% BI had an increase of T cell proliferation
from the spleen, but such change was not found between 1 and 2% BI treated mice. 
Also, BI at 2% increased the production of IL-2 of splenocytes stimulated with
T-cell mitogens, but BI at 1 and 2% did not affect productions of other splenic-T
cell cytokines including IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Interestingly, BI at 1 or 2%
inhibited T cell proliferation of mesenteric lymph node (mLN) but this effect was
not found between 1 and 2% BI treated mice. Furthermore, BI inhibited the
production of IL-2 in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells from mLN in a
dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, BI at 2%, not 1% inhibited the production of
IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ of mLN. Since BI at 2% produced a more significant effect 
on the immune response, we further used BI at 2% to evaluate the effect of BI on 
gut microbiota. Of note, BI reduced the diversity of gut microbiota and resulted 
in an increase of Faecalibaculum and Parabacteroides abundance and the decrease
of Allobaculum, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, and Rikenella abundance at the genus
level. Finally, the correlation was observed between specific bacteria genera and
the productions of T-cell cytokines from mesenteric lymphocytes: Rikenella and
Candidatus_Saccharimonas correlated positively with IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ;
Bacteroides and Parabacteroides correlated negatively with IL-2 and IL-4;
Faecalibaculum correlated negatively with IFN-γ and IL-4 and Bacteroides and
Bifidobacterium correlated negatively with IFN-γ. The specific role of each
intestinal microbiota observed is still unclear, but BI might exert a prebiotic
effect on gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of potentially beneficial
bacteria (Faecalibaculum). This is helpful for further demonstrating the
healthy-promotion mechanism of B. inquinans.
