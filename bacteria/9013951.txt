To elucidate the molecular basis for inhibition of B cell proliferation and
differentiation by the Fc receptor for IgG (Fc(gamma)RII), we compared the
signaling events in B cells stimulated by cross-linking surface Ig alone
(positive signaling), or by co-cross-linking surface Ig and Fc(gamma)RII
(negative signaling). Both modes of stimulation induced tyrosine kinase
activation. Positive signaling induced activation of Ras, Raf-1 kinase, and
mitogen-activated protein kinase; these events were significantly attenuated
during negative signaling. Since Ras is activated by SOS and Vav, two known
guanine nucleotide exchange factors, activation events associated with these
molecules using the two different stimuli were examined. Results of these
experiments indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav did not change upon
co-cross-linking. In contrast, the association of Shc and Grb2 was abrogated
under negative and induced under positive signaling conditions. Concomitantly,
Shc was observed to associate with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 145-kDa protein,
previously identified as Src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase, only
under conditions of negative signaling. Based on these results, we hypothesize
that negative signaling via the Fc(gamma)RII in B cells is at least partly the
result of a block in Ras activation, and that SOS, but not Vav, is the major
guanine nucleotide exchange factor in B cells for Ras activation.
