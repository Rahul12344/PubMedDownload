A chromosomally located operon (ars) of Escherichia coli has been previously
shown to be functional in arsenic detoxification. DNA sequencing revealed three
open reading frames homologous to the arsR, arsB, and arsC open reading frames of
plasmid-based arsenic resistance operons isolated from both E. coli and
staphylococcal species. To examine the outline of transcriptional regulation of
the chromosomal ars operon, several transcriptional fusions, using the
luciferase-encoding luxAB genes of Vibrio harveyi, were constructed. Measurement 
of the expression of these gene fusions demonstrated that the operon was rapidly 
induced by sodium arsenite and negatively regulated by the trans-acting arsR gene
product. Northern blotting and primer extension analyses revealed that the
chromosomal ars operon is most likely transcribed as a single mRNA of
approximately 2100 nucleotides in length and processed into two smaller mRNA
products in a manner similar to that found in the E. coli R773 plasmid-borne ars 
operon. However, transcription was found to initiate at a position that is
relatively further upstream of the initiation codon of the arsR coding sequence
than that determined for the E. coli R773 plasmid's ars operon.
