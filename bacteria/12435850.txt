Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by
increased spontaneous and DNA crosslinker-induced chromosome instability,
progressive pancytopenia and cancer susceptibility. An increasing number of genes
are involved in FA, including the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2. Five
of the FA proteins (FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF and FANCG) assemble in a complex
that is required for FANCD2 activation in response to DNA crosslinks. Active
FANCD2 then interacts with BRCA1 and forms discrete nuclear foci. FANCD2 is
independently phosphorylated by ATM (the protein whose gene is mutated in ataxia 
telangiectasia) in response to ionizing radiation. In addition, the FA proteins
are interconnected with other nuclear and cytoplasmic factors all related to
cellular responses to carcinogenic stress and to caretaker and gatekeeper
functions. In this review, the most recently published data on the molecular
biology of the FA pathway and its molecular crosstalk with ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2, 
proteins involved in xenobiotic and reactive oxygen species metabolism,
apoptosis, cell cycle control and telomere stability, are summarized. The
currently available data indicate that FA is a central node in a complex nuclear 
and cytoplasmic network of tumour suppressor and genome stability pathways fully 
committed to prevent cancer.
