Existing pertussis surveillance systems tend to underidentify less severe cases
among older children and adults. For routine follow-up of notified, nonconfirmed,
clinically diagnosed pertussis cases, use of an oral fluid test was pilot tested 
in England and Wales during June 2007-August 2009. During that period, 1,852
cases of pertussis were confirmed by established laboratory methods and another
591 by oral fluid testing only. Although introduction of serologic testing in
2002 led to the greatest increase in ascertainment of pertussis, oral fluid
testing increased laboratory ascertainment by 32% overall; maximal increase
(124%) occurred among children 5-9 years of age. Patients whose pertussis was
confirmed by oral fluid testing were least likely to be hospitalized, suggesting 
that milder community cases were being confirmed by this method. Oral fluid
testing is an easily administered, noninvasive surveillance tool that could
further our understanding of pertussis epidemiology and thereby contribute to
decisions on vaccination strategies.
