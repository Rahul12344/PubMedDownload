Regulatory T cells (Treg) restrain immune responses against malignant tumors, but
their global depletion in cancer patients will likely be limited by systemic
autoimmune toxicity. Instead, approaches to "tune" their activities may allow for
preferential targeting of tumor-reactive Treg. Although Ag recognition regulates 
Treg function, the roles of individual TCR-dependent signaling pathways in
enabling Treg to promote tumor tolerance are not well characterized. In this
study, we examined in mouse tumor models the role of calcineurin, a key mediator 
of TCR signaling, and the role of the costimulatory receptor CD28 in the
differentiation of resting central Treg into effector Treg endowed with tumor
tropism. We find that calcineurin, although largely dispensable for suppressive
activity in vitro, is essential for upregulation of ICOS and CTLA-4 in Treg, as
well as for expression of chemokine receptors driving their accumulation in
tumors. In contrast, CD28 is not critical, but optimizes the formation of
tumor-homing Treg and their fitness in tumor tissue. Accordingly, although
deletion of either CnB or CD28 strongly impairs Treg-mediated tumor tolerance,
lack of CnB has an even more pronounced impact than lack of CD28. Hence, our
studies reveal distinct roles for what has classically been defined as signal 1
and signal 2 of conventional T cell activation in the context of Treg-mediated
tumor tolerance.
