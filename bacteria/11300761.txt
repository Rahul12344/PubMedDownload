Human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) is a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial
peptides. HBD-2 was first isolated from inflamed skin where it is posited to
participate in the killing of invasive bacteria and in the recruitment of cells
of the adaptive immune response. Static light scattering and two-dimensional
proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been used to assess the
physical state and structure of HBD-2 in solution. At concentrations of < or =
2.4 mM, HBD-2 is monomeric. The structure is amphiphilic with a nonuniform
surface distribution of positive charge and contains several key structural
elements, including a triple-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet with strands 2 and
3 in a beta-hairpin conformation. A beta-bulge in the second strand occurs at
Gly28, a position conserved in the entire defensin family. In solution, HBD-2
exhibits an alpha-helical segment near the N-terminus that has not been
previously ascribed to solution structures of alpha-defensins or to the
beta-defensin BNBD-12. This novel structural element may be a factor contributing
to the specific microbicidal or chemokine-like properties of HBD-2.
