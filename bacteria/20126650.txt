Lck and Fyn, members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, are key components of
the alphabetaTCR-coupled signaling pathway. While it is generally accepted that
both Lck and Fyn positively regulate signal transduction by the alphabetaTCR,
recent studies have shown that Lck and Fyn have distinct functions in this
signaling pathway, with Lck being a positive regulator and Fyn being a negative
regulator of alphabetaTCR signal transduction. To determine whether Lck and Fyn
also differentially regulate gammadeltaTCR signal transduction, we analyzed
gammadelta T cell development and function in mice with reduced Lck or Fyn
expression levels. We found that reducing Lck or Fyn levels altered the strength 
of the gammadeltaTCR signaling response, with low levels of Lck weakening
gammadeltaTCR signal strength and low levels of Fyn augmenting gammadeltaTCR
signal strength. These alterations in gammadeltaTCR signal strength had profound 
effects not only on alphabeta/gammadelta lineage choice, but also on gammadelta
thymocyte maturation and gammadelta T cell effector function. These results
indicate that the cellular levels of Lck and Fyn play a role in regulating the
strength of the gammadeltaTCR signaling response at different stages in the life 
of the gammadelta T cell.
