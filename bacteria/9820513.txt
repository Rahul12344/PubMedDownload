The neonatal period marks an important time in mammalian immunologic development,
yet it is often ignored in studies of lymphocyte development. We identified a
cell population with the phenotype heat stable Ag (HSA)low lin- CD43low that
contained B cell progenitors at a high frequency in the neonatal bone marrow and 
spleen. Although cells with a similar phenotype can be identified in the bone
marrow and spleen of adult animals, these populations showed a greatly reduced
frequency of B cell progenitors. B lineage cells were detected after 7 days in
culture at a frequency of 1:15 when HSAlow lin- CD43low cells from neonatal bone 
marrow were cultured on stromal cells and IL-7 under limiting dilution
conditions. Under similar conditions, the equivalent population in adult bone
marrow had a frequency of B cell progenitors that was less than 1:2000. The
expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in freshly sorted neonatal
HSAlow lin- CD43low cells suggested that cells committed to the lymphocyte
lineage were present in this population. These data suggested that the HSAlow
lin- CD43low population of cells represents a pool of B lineage precursors that
may be responsible for filling the immune compartment early in neonatal life.
