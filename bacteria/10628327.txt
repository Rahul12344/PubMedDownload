Helicobacter pylori (HP) is the causative agent of many gastrointestinal
diseases. Horses, calves, pigs, rabbits, and chickens were evaluated for HP
presence, and the pathogenetic effect on their gastric mucosa. The large-sized
animals all resulted positive. No positive cases were observed in rabbits and
chickens. Chronic inflammatory response to the infection with the development of 
acquired lymphoid tissue associated to the mucosa was revealed. The recognition
of HP in animals living near the human habitat such as animals for slaughter and 
for technical zootechnic and alimentary use, before the witnessing of the
transmission of this infection such as a zoonosis or an anthropozoonosis, can
contribute to research on a common source for human and animals as reservoir. It 
is possible to consider that the intraspecies transmission of infection occurs by
vomit, the mucus acting as a vector, while the interspecies one is due to the
faecal contamination of the food chain.
