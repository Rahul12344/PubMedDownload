Mycobacterial infection leads to the formation of characteristic immune
aggregates called granulomas, a process accompanied by dramatic remodeling of the
host vasculature. As granuloma angiogenesis favors the infecting mycobacteria, it
may be actively promoted by bacterial determinants during infection. Using
Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish as a model, we identify the enzyme
proximal cyclopropane synthase of alpha-mycolates (PcaA) as an important
bacterial determinant of granuloma-associated angiogenesis. cis-Cyclopropanation 
of mycobacterial mycolic acids by pcaA drives the activation of host Vegf
signaling within granuloma macrophages. Cyclopropanation of the mycobacterial
cell wall glycolipid trehalose dimycolate is both required and sufficient to
induce robust host angiogenesis. Inducible genetic inhibition of angiogenesis and
Vegf signaling during granuloma formation results in bacterial growth deficits.
Together, these data reveal a mechanism by which PcaA-mediated
cis-cyclopropanation of mycolic acids promotes bacterial growth and dissemination
in vivo by eliciting granuloma vascularization and suggest potential approaches
for host-directed therapies.
