BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide. Infections after stroke
occur in 30% of stroke patients and are strongly associated with unfavourable
outcome. Preventive antibiotic therapy lowers infection rate in patients after
stroke, however, the effect of preventive antibiotic treatment on functional
outcome after stroke has not yet been investigated.The Preventive Antibiotics in 
Stroke Study (PASS) is an ongoing, multicentre, prospective, randomised,
open-label, blinded end point trial of preventive antibiotic therapy in acute
stroke. Patients are randomly assigned to either ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g,
given every 24 hours intravenously for four-days, in addition to stroke-unit
care, or standard stroke-unit care without preventive antibiotic therapy. Aim of 
the study is to assess whether preventive antibiotic treatment improves
functional outcome at three months by preventing infections.
RESULTS: To date, 2,470 patients have been included in PASS. Median stroke
severity of the first 2,133 patients (second interim analysis) is 5 (IQR 3 to 9) 
on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Due to the PROBE
design, no outcome data are available yet. In the initial trial protocol we
proposed a dichotomisation of the mRS as primary analysis of outcome and ordinal 
regression analysis as secondary analysis of primary outcome, requiring a sample 
size of 3,200 patients. However, ordinal analysis of outcome data is becoming
increasingly more common in acute stroke trials, as it increases statistical
power. For PASS, funding is insufficient for inclusion of 3,200 patients with the
overall inclusion rate of 15 patients per week. Therefore we change the analysis 
of our primary outcome from dichotomisation to ordinal regression analysis on the
mRS. Power analysis showed that with similar assumptions 2,550 patients are
needed using ordinal regression analysis. We expect to complete follow-up in June
2014. A full statistical analysis plan will be submitted for publication before
treatment allocation will be unblinded.
CONCLUSION: The data from PASS will establish whether preventive antibiotic
therapy in acute stroke improves functional outcome by preventing infection. In
this update, we changed our primary outcome analysis from dichotomisation to
ordinal regression analysis.
