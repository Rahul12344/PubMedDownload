Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and neovascular age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) are prevalent age-related diseases characterized by exudative 
changes in the macula. Although they share anatomical and clinical similarities, 
they are also distinctly characterized by their own features, e.g. vascular
abnormalities in PCV and drusen-mediated progression in neovascular AMD. PCV
remains etiologically uncharacterized, and ongoing discussion is whether PCV and 
neovascular AMD share the same etiology or constitute two substantially different
diseases. In this study, we investigated T-cell differentiation and aging profile
in human patients with PCV, patients with neovascular AMD, and age-matched
healthy control individuals. Fresh venous blood was prepared for flow cytometry
to investigate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell differentiation (naïve, central memory,
effector memory, effector memory CD45ra+), loss of differentiation markers CD27
and CD28, and expression of aging marker CD56. Patients with PCV were similar to 
the healthy controls in all aspects. In patients with neovascular AMD we found
significantly accelerated T-cell differentiation (more CD28-CD27- cells) and
aging (more CD56+ cells) in the CD8+ T-cell compartment. These findings suggest
that PCV and neovascular AMD are etiologically different in terms of T cell
immunity, and that neovascular AMD is associated with T-cell immunosenescence.
