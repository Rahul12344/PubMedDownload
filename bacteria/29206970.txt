The purpose of this study was to determine whether thrombospondin (TSP)-1
promotes macrophage activity and disease progression in dysferlinopathy. First,
we found that levels of TSP-1 are elevated in blood of non-ambulant
dysferlinopathy patients compared with ambulant patients and healthy controls,
supporting the idea that TSP-1 levels are correlated with disease progression. We
then crossed dysferlinopathic BlaJ mice with TSP-1 knockout mice and assessed
disease progression longitudinally with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In
these mice, deletion of TSP-1 ameliorated loss in volume and mass of the
moderately affected gluteal muscle but not of the severely affected psoas muscle.
T2 MRI parameters revealed that loss of TSP-1 modestly inhibited inflammation
only in gluteal muscle of male mice. Histological assessment indicated that
deletion of TSP-1 reduced inflammatory cell infiltration of muscle fibers, but
only early in disease progression. In addition, flow cytometry analysis revealed 
that, in males, TSP-1 knockout reduced macrophage infiltration and phagocytic
activity, which is consistent with TSP-1-enhanced phagocytosis and
pro-inflammatory cytokine induction in cultured macrophages. In summary, TSP-1
appears to play an accessory role in modulating Mp activity in BlaJ mice in a
gender, age and muscle-dependent manner, but is unlikely a primary driver of
disease progression of dysferlinopathy.
