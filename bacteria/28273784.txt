BACKGROUND: B cells are key pathogenic effectors in multiple sclerosis (MS) and
several therapies have been designed to restrain B cell abnormalities by directly
targeting this lymphocyte population.
OBJECTIVES: Moving from our data showing a Toll-like receptor (TLR)7-driven
dysregulation of B cell response in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)
and having found a low serum level of Thymosin-α1 (Tα1) in patients, we
investigated whether the addition of this molecule to peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) would influence the expansion of regulatory B cell
subsets, known to dampen autoimmune inflammation.
METHODS: Serum Tα1 level was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Cytokine expression 
was evaluated by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
B cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Tα1 pre-treatment induces an anti-inflammatory status in TLR7-stimulated
RRMS PBMC cultures, reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory interleukin
(IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-1β while significantly increasing the regulatory IL-10 and
IL-35. Indeed, Tα1 treatment enhanced expansion of CD19+CD24+CD38hi
transitional-immature and CD24low/negCD38hi plasmablast-like regulatory B cell
subsets, which likely inhibit both interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-17 production.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a deficient ability of B cells from MS patients to 
differentiate into regulatory subsets and unveils a novel anti-inflammatory and
repurposing potential for Tα1 in MS targeting B cell response.
