To satisfy the demand of industrial production, selecting strains suitable for
fermentation initiation is necessary. In this study, the effects of mixed-starter
culture including Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Weissella on the quality of
Sichuan pickle were discussed. Results showed that mixed-starter culture can
accelerate fermentation and had the highest efficiency for nitrite degradation,
that is, the maximum nitrite concentration was 8.97 g/kg on day 1 and decreased
to 1.88 mg/kg after 3 days. The mixed-starter culture improved the sensory
properties of pickles, which easily produced acids but had reduced amounts of
total acids. The pickle products fermented by the mixed-starter culture contained
increased lactic acid (17.52 g/kg), mannitol (0.62%), umami (35.85), and sweet
(11.36) amino acids on day 4. The strains Weissella paramesenteroides C2-2 and
Lactobacillus brevis ZP11-2 grew well in the mixed-starter culture fermentation.
