Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein that
enhances the responsiveness of immune cells to LPS by virtue of its capacity to
transfer LPS to CD14. To determine the role of LBP in the innate immune response 
to peritonitis, LBP gene-deficient (LBP(-/-)) and normal wild-type mice were
intraperitoneally infected with Escherichia coli, the most common causative
pathogen of this disease. LBP was detected at low concentrations in peritoneal
fluid of healthy wild-type mice, and the local LBP levels increased rapidly upon 
induction of peritonitis. LBP(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to E. coli
peritonitis, as indicated by accelerated mortality, earlier bacterial
dissemination to the blood, impaired bacterial clearance in the peritoneal
cavity, and more severe remote organ damage. LBP(-/-) mice displayed diminished
early tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, cytokine-induced neutrophil
chemoattractant, and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 production and attenuated 
recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of infection, indicating 
that acute inflammation was promoted by LBP. Locally produced LBP is an essential
component of an effective innate immune response to E. coli peritonitis.
