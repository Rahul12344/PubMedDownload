Porins and lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhimurium regulate the expression
of CD80 and CD86 molecules on B cells and macrophages but not CD28 and CD152 on T
cells.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of porins from
Salmonella typhimurium on costimulatory molecules such as CD80/CD86 and
CD28/CD152. The interactions between these molecules are able to influence the
immune response through the regulation of cytokines release which, on their own, 
are able to regulate the immunological response by a feedback mechanism.
METHODS: S. typhimurium strain SH5014 (a rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS) producing
strain) was used as the source of porins and LPS. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were obtained from healthy adult donors. THP1 cells were obtained from ATCC
(Rockville, MD, USA). Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were performed using 
a FACS IV (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA).
RESULTS: Our results show that porins of S. typhimurium increase the expression
of CD86 and the expression of CD80 both on B lymphocytes and macrophages, while
the expression of CD28 and CD152 on T lymphocytes was unaltered. The expression
of CD80 and CD86 is dose-dependent and starts after 24 h post treatment, peaks at
48 h and goes back to the basal value after 72 h.
CONCLUSIONS: S. typhimurium porins are able to induce a high expression of
costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) on lymphocytes and macrophages.
