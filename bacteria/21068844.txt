Mononuclear iron-containing oxygenases conduct a diverse variety of oxidation
functions in biology, including the oxidative demethylation of methylated nucleic
acids and histones. Escherichia coli AlkB is the first such enzyme that was
discovered to repair methylated nucleic acids, which are otherwise cytotoxic
and/or mutagenic. AlkB human homologues are known to play pivotal roles in
various processes. Here we present structural characterization of oxidation
intermediates for these demethylases. Using a chemical cross-linking strategy,
complexes of AlkB-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing 1,N(6)-etheno adenine
(εA), N(3)-methyl thymine (3-meT) and N(3)-methyl cytosine (3-meC) are stabilized
and crystallized, respectively. Exposing these crystals, grown under anaerobic
conditions containing iron(II) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG), to dioxygen initiates
oxidation in crystallo. Glycol (from εA) and hemiaminal (from 3-meT)
intermediates are captured; a zwitterionic intermediate (from 3-meC) is also
proposed, based on crystallographic observations and computational analysis. The 
observation of these unprecedented intermediates provides direct support for the 
oxidative demethylation mechanism for these demethylases. This study also depicts
a general mechanistic view of how a methyl group is oxidatively removed from
different biological substrates.
