In response to infection, epithelia mount an innate immune response that includes
the production of antimicrobial peptides. However, the pathways that connect
infection and inflammation with the induction of antimicrobial peptides in
epithelia are not understood. We analyzed the molecular links between infection
and the expression of three antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family,
human beta-defensin (hBD)-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 in the human epidermis. After
exposure to microbe-derived molecules, both monocytes and lymphocytes stimulated 
the epidermal expression of hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3. The induced expression of
hBD-3 was mediated by transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor.
The mechanisms of induction of hBD-1 and hBD-3 were distinct from each other and 
from the IL-1-dependent induction of hBD-2 expression. Thus during inflammation, 
epidermal expression of beta-defensins is mediated by at least three different
mechanisms.
