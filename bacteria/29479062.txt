The PI 3-kinases (PI3K) are essential mediators of chemokine receptor signaling
necessary for migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and their
interaction with tissue-resident stromal cells. While the PI3Kδ-specific
inhibitor idelalisib shows efficacy in treatment of CLL and other B cell
malignancies, the function of PI3Kγ has not been extensively studied in B cells. 
Here, we assess whether PI3Kγ has non-redundant functions in CLL migration and
adhesion to stromal cells. We observed that pharmaceutical PI3Kγ inhibition with 
CZC24832 significantly impaired CLL cell migration, while dual PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor 
duvelisib had a greater impact than single isoform-selective inhibitors.
Knockdown of PI3Kγ reduced migration of CLL cells and cell lines. Expression of
the PI3Kγ subunits increased in CLL cells in response to CD40L/IL-4, whereas BCR 
cross-linking had no effect. Overexpression of PI3Kγ subunits enhanced cell
migration in response to SDF1α/CXCL12, with the strongest effect observed within 
ZAP70 + CLL samples. Microscopic tracking of cell migration within chemokine
gradients revealed that PI3Kγ functions in gradient sensing and impacts cell
morphology and F-actin polarization. PI3Kγ inhibition also reduced CLL adhesion
to stromal cells to a similar extent as idelalisib. These findings provide the
first evidence that PI3Kγ has unique functions in malignant B cells.
