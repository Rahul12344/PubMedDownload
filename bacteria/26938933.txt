INTRODUCTION: Borrelia recurrentis, transmitted by Pediculus humanus humanus, is 
the etiological agent of louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF). Currently the main
focus of endemicity of LBRF is localized in East African countries. From July
2015 to October 2015, 36 cases of LBRF have been diagnosed in Europe in
immigrants from the Horn of Africa. Here we report a case of LBRF with meningitis
diagnosed in Florence, Italy, in an immigrant arrived from Somalia.
CASE STUDY: In October 2015, a 19-year-old Somali male presented to the emergency
department of the Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy,
with a 3-day history of high fever. The patient had disembarked in Sicily 10 days
before admission after a long migration trip from his country of origin. On
clinical examination, neck stiffness was found. Main laboratory findings were
thrombocytopenia, increased procalcitonin, and increased polymorphonucleates in
the cerebrospinal fluid. Suspecting a possible meningitis, the patient was
treated with ceftriaxone, pending results of laboratory testing for malaria, and 
developed severe hypotension that was treated with fluid resuscitation and
hydrocortisone. Hemoscopic testing revealed the presence of spirochetes and no
malaria parasites. The patient rapidly improved with doxycycline for 7 days and
ceftriaxone for 11 days, then was lost to follow-up. Total DNA from blood was
extracted, and amplification and sequencing with universal 16S rDNA primers D88
and E94 revealed a 100% identity with B. recurrentis A1.
CONCLUSIONS: LBRF is a rare but emerging infectious disease among vulnerable
displaced immigrants from the Horn of Africa. Since immigrants from endemic areas
can carry the vector with them, the infection should be suspected even in
subjects with compatible clinical features living in the same place where new
arrival immigrants are hosted. Healthcare providers should be aware of this
condition to implement adequate diagnostic, therapeutic, and public health
measures.
