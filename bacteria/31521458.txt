Starting from 9-methyl-1,2,3,4,9,9a-hexahydro-4aH-pyrido[2,3-b]indol-4a-ol, or
indole-3-acetonitrile, 40 new calycanthaceous alkaloid analogs were synthesized
in excellent yields. The prepared compounds were evaluated for biological
activity against acetylcholinesterase and a broad range of plant pathogen fungi. 
The results of bioassays indicated that the majority of tested compounds
displayed comparable or better in vitro bioactivity than the positive control.
Notably, compounds b8 and b9 showed higher activity against Verticillium dahlia
than chlorothalonil, with MIC values of 62.5 and 7.81 µg mL-1, respectively.
Compound b3 had a higher activity against Bacillus cereus, with a MIC value of
15.63 µg mL-1. Compounds c2 and c11 revealed potent activity against
acetylcholinesterase, with MIC values of 0.01 and 0.1 ng mL-1, respectively.
Analysis of the molecular docking modes of c2 and c11 with Torpedo californica
acetylcholinesterase indicated a medium strong hydrogen bond interaction between 
the hydroxyl groups of both the ligands and the phenolic hydroxyl of Try121 at a 
distance of approximately 2.4 Å. The results obtained in this study will be
useful for the further design and structural optimization of calycanthaceous
alkaloids as potential agrochemical lead compounds for plant disease control.
