Our previous studies showed that bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) from
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pre-treated rats (named BMRMNCs) had a better therapeutic
efficacy in ischemia/reperfusion rats as compared to BMMNCs from untreated rats. 
This study was undertaken to further explore the potential mechanisms underlying 
the neuroprotective effects of BMRMNCs in the same model. Rats were intravenously
pre-treated with 5-FU, and BMRMNCs were collected 7 days later and subjected to
flow cytometry for detection of CD34, CD45 and CD90. Middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) was induced in rats, and BMMNCs and BMRMNCs were independently
transplanted via the tail vein at 24 h after MCAO. NISSL staining was performed
14 days after cell transplantation and the viable cells in the hippocampus were
counted. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) mRNA expression was detected in
the penumbra at 7 and 14 days after treatment. The contents of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and growth factors as well as microvessel density (MVD) were determined
at 14 days. Results showed more BMRMNCs were positive for CD34, CD45 and CD90.
After transplantation, more viable cells were observed in the hippocampus of
BMRMNCs treated rats. In addition, BMRMNCs transplantation significantly
increased MVD, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and raised growth factors in
the penumbra. However, the SDF-1 mRNA expression was comparable between BMRMNCs
group and BMMNCs group. Our results indicate that BMRMNCs are likely to more
effectively improve the local microenvironment to increase viable cells and
elevate angiogenesis, exerting neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia in
rats.
