Objective: Renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is associated with complement
overactivation and poor outcome in patients with lupus nephritis (LN). The role
of genetic makeup of complement system in these patients remains to be
elucidated. Methods: The clinical and laboratory characteristics of 100 patients 
with LN during 2010-2017 were retrospectively analyzed. LN patients with renal
TMA and condition-matched LN patients without renal TMA were studied. Twenty
normal subjects were also enrolled for comparison. Whole exome sequence followed 
by Sanger sequence was used in our study cohort. Results: Eight patients with
renal TMA and eight condition-matched patients were enrolled from 100 LN patients
with mean age 11.2 ± 2.0 years. Compared with condition-matched LN patients
without renal TMA, LN patients with renal TMA exhibited statistically higher
serum urea. Although most patients with renal TMA responded to plasma exchange,
they had significantly higher relapse rate of nephritis, lower remission rate,
and higher risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality. Compared with patients 
without renal TMA and normal subjects, those with renal TMA had significantly
lower serum complement factor H (CFH) and plasma ADAMTS13 activity. Molecular
analysis of all 100 patients with LN uncovered that three patients with renal TMA
harbored mutations, two missense and non-sense, on CFI and CFHR2. The non-sense
mutation, E302X, on CFI may impair its interaction C3b/CFH complex by loss of the
heavy chain of complement factor I on simulation model. Conclusion: In addition
to low serum CFH level and plasma ADAMTS13 activity, defects in genes responsible
for complement regulatory proteins may contribute to the development of renal TMA
in patients with LN.
