OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemases represent a public health threat, as they can spread
through horizontal gene transfer and cause outbreaks. New Delhi
metallo-ß-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a metallo-ß-lactamase that has spread rapidly in
the last decade, causing worldwide alarm. This study aimed to describe the first 
isolate of NDM-1-producing and extensively drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
in Albania, its clinical context and genetic characterization.
METHODS: Strain was isolated from both oral and rectal intensive care unit
admission screening swabs of a 70-year-old male patient with no history of
international travel in the previous 6 months. Sequencing was performed by
Illumina NextSeq500 platform, with a paired-end run of 2 by 150bp, after Nextera 
XT paired-end library preparation. Sequencing reads were assembled using SPAdes
Genome (version 3.6.1) with accurate de novo settings. The assembled contigs were
uploaded into the online tools: BIGSdb-Kp, ResFinder and PlasmidFinder.
RESULTS: Isolate was resistant to all tested antibiotics but tigecycline and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Sequencing revealed the presence of acquired
resistance genes conferring resistance to β-lactams (blaNDM-1, blaCMY-6,
blaCTX-M-15and blaSHV-28), aminoglycosides (rmtC, aac(6')-Ib3), fluoroquinolones 
(oqxA, oqxB, aac(6')-Ib-cr), fosfomycin (fosA) and sulfonamides (sul1). The
blaNDM-1 gene was located on an IncA/C2 plasmid. Plasmid mediated mcr-1 to mcr-8 
genes were absent in both isolates. Resistance to colistin was due to an amino
acid substitution (Thr157Pro) in PmrB protein.
CONCLUSIONS: NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae are spreading in the Balkans.
Identification of NDM-1-producing and extensively drug resistant K. pneumoniae
ST15 in Albania is a cause for serious concern. There should be a continuous
national and Balkan multinational surveillance of blaNDM-1-carrying isolates.
