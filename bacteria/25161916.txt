Science is a dynamic subject and it was never free of misconduct or bad research.
Indeed, the scientific method itself is intended to overcome mistakes and
misdeeds. So, we aimed to assess various factors associated with retraction of
scientific articles from 2004 to 2013. Data were retrieved from PubMed and
Medline using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and
withdrawal of article in April 2014 to detect articles retracted from 2004 to
2013. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and Karl Pearson's
correlation coefficient. Results showed that a total of 2343 articles were
retracted between 2004 and 2013, and original articles followed by case reports
constituted major part of it. Time interval between submission and retraction of 
article has reduced in recent times. Impact factor and retraction do not have any
significant correlation. We conclude that although retraction of articles is a
rare event, its constant rise in scientific literature is quite worrisome. It is 
still unclear whether misconduct/mistakes in articles are increasing hastily or
the articles are retracted at a rapid rate in recent times. So, it should be
considered as an urgent issue and it is the responsibility of journal editors to 
track misconduct by following Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines
and making an effective strategy.
