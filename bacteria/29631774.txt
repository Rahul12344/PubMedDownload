BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has health benefits in many respiratory diseases but the
evidence in CF is unclear. Induction of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin
(LL37) and human-beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) may be the mechanism of any benefit. We 
hypothesised that antimicrobial peptide levels would be decreased, and airway
infection and inflammation greater, in CF children with vitamin D deficiency. The
objective of the study was to explore relationships between vitamin D, LL37 and
HBD-2, and airway infection, inflammation and physiology in children with CF.
METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) and blood were obtained from children
undergoing fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Serum vitamin D, BALF HBD-2 and LL37,
cultured bacteria and inflammatory markers were measured. Clinical parameters
were recorded.
RESULTS: 113 patients with CF, 23 with non-CF chronic suppurative lung disease
(CSLD) and 6 healthy controls were included. We found no relationship between
serum vitamin D and BALF HBD-2 or LL-37. There were no differences in infective
or inflammatory markers between vitamin D sufficient and deficient groups.
Vitamin D deficient patients (<50 nmol/L) did not have a worse FEV1 (CF: 66
(58-71)% vs. 71.5 (61-76)%, ns; non-CF CSLD: 69 (36-88)% vs. 70 (62-95)%, ns).
CONCLUSIONS: In the first bronchoscopic study exploring this question, we
demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency is not associated with immunological,
infective or clinical markers of disease severity in patients with CF or CSLD.
