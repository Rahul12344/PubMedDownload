BACKGROUND: Candida albicans (C albicans) is the most common fungal pathogen
causing opportunistic infections. IL17 (IL17A) is a vital mediator of antifungal 
immunity. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of recombinant human
interleukin 17A (rhIL17A) on human oral mucosal epithelial cells (hOMECs)
defending against C albicans infection.
METHODS: Human oral mucosal epithelial cells were divided into four groups:
C albicans+ (MOI = 0.1), rhIL17A+ (100 μg/L), rhIL17A + C albicans+ (MOI = 0.1,
rhIL17A:100 μg/L) and blank control. Then, C albicans growth was observed after
24 hours. Human beta-2 defensin (hBD-2), S100A8 and LL-37 in supernatants and
their mRNAs in cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively.
RESULTS: In C albicans+ group, C albicans hyphae formation and the death of
infected hOMECs were observed. However, in the rhIL17A + C albicans+ group, IL17 
inhibited both hypha formation, and C albicans from infecting hOMECs and its
further growth. There was no statistical significance in adhesion rates of
C albicans to hOMECs. Compared with the control group, the level of hBD-2 mRNA
has increased, while hBD-2 and hBD-2 mRNA levels in the rhIL17A + C albicans+
group were the highest. Both hBD-2 and hBD-2 mRNA levels were higher in the
rhIL17A+ group than in the C albicans+ group. S100A8 and LL-37 mRNAs have similar
trend, and both upregulated after treatment with rhIL17A; however, protein levels
were undetectable.
CONCLUSION: Recombinant human interleukin 17A may inhibit C albicans from
infecting hOMECs by affecting the growth and reproduction of C albicans as well
as the formation of hyphae. Besides, rhIL17A might induce hBD-2, S100A8 and LL-37
secretion from hOMECs to strengthen their anti-infective ability.
