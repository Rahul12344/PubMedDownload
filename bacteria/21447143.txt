Mycobacterium marinum induces a marked LC3 recruitment to its containing
phagosome that depends on a functional ESX-1 secretion system.

Autophagy has been implicated as part of the innate immune system against
different intracellular microorganisms. Mycobacterium marinum is the causative
agent of the fish-tank granuloma and has been widely used as an alternative model
to study pathogenic mycobacteria. In this report, we show an active interaction
of M. marinum with the autophagic protein LC3, an event that requires pathogen
viability and bacterial protein synthesis. Interestingly, M. marinum lacking the 
region of difference 1 (RD1) is unable to recruit LC3, indicating that a
functional ESX-1 secretion system is an absolute requirement for this process. In
addition, phagocytosis of the bacteria is also a condition for the LC3
rearrangement induced by M. marinum. We present evidence that this pathogen
resides temporarily in a LC3-decorated compartment with late endocytic features
but mostly devoid of lysosomal enzymes or degradative properties. In addition our
results indicate that autophagy induction by rapamycin treatment leads to
maturation of the M. marinum-containing compartment.
