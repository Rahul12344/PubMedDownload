Background and Aim. We studied through flow cytometry the expression of CD146 on 
different T cells, and B-cell ALL blasts trying to correlate its expression with 
different prognostic factors of B-cell ALL and treatment outcomes. Patients and
Methods. All pediatric patients with B-cell ALL were subjected to bone marrow
examination and cytochemistry, flow cytometric immunophenotyping using monoclonal
antibodies utilized for diagnosis of B-ALL including CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22, and 
intracellular IgM. The diagnosis was based on standard morphologic, cytochemical,
and immunophenotypic followed by flow cytometric detection of CD146 expression on
blast cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells.Results: Significant accumulations of
CD146+CD4+ cells, CD146+CD8+ cells, CD4+, CD8+, and lymphocytes in patients were 
compared to controls, the mean percentages of CD146+CD4+ cells, CD146+CD8+ cells,
and CD146+ blasts were significantly higher in patients than controls, and in
addition, these cells were associated with poor overall survival and disease-free
survival. The median OS for patients with complete response was 22 ± 1.633 (95%CI
= 18.799-25.201), while for those without complete response, it was 13 ± 3.928
(95%CI = 5.301-25.699), with log-rank = 5.71, P = 0.017.
Conclusion: CD146 was expressed significantly in children's B-ALL and associated 
with poor prognostic features including poor response and treatment outcomes and 
could be a possible poor prognostic factor in pediatric B-cell ALL.
