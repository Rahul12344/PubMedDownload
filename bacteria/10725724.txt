MHC class II deficiency or bare lymphocyte syndrome is a severe combined
immunodeficiency caused by defects in MHC-specific regulatory factors.
Fibroblasts derived from two recently identified bare lymphocyte syndrome
patients, EBA and FZA, were found to contain novel mutations in the RFX-B gene.
RFX-B encodes a component of the RFX transcription factor that functions in the
assembly of multiple transcription factors on MHC class II promoters. Unlike
RFX5- and RFXAP-deficient cells, transfection of exogenous class II
transactivator (CIITA) into these RFX-B-deficient fibroblasts resulted in the
induction of HLA-DR and HLA-DP and, to a lesser extent, HLA-DQ. Similarly,
CIITA-mediated induction of MHC class I, beta2-microglobulin, and invariant chain
genes was also found in these RFX-B-deficient fibroblasts. Expression of
wild-type RFX-B completely reverted the noted deficiencies in these cells.
Transfection of CIITA into Ramia cells, a B cell line that does not produce a
stable RFX-B mRNA, resulted in induction of an MHC class II reporter, suggesting 
that CIITA overexpression may partially override the RFX-B defect.
