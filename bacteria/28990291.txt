INTRODUCTION: Recent automated hematology analyzers (HAs) can identify and report
nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) count as a separate population out of white
blood cells (WBC). The aim of this study was to investigate the analytical
performances of NRBC enumeration on five top of the range HAs.
METHODS: We evaluated the within-run and between-day precision, limit of blank
(LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of XE-2100 and
XN-module (Sysmex), ADVIA 2120i (Siemens), BC-6800 (Mindray), and UniCel DxH 800 
(Beckman Coulter). Automated NRBC counts were also compared with optical
microscopy (OM).
RESULTS: The limits of detection for NRBC of the BC-6800, XN-module, XE-2100,
UniCel DxH 800, and ADVIA 2120i are 0.035×109 /L, 0.019×109 /L, 0.067×109 /L,
0.038×109 /L, and 0.167×109 /L, respectively. Our data indicated excellent
performance in terms of precision. The agreement with OM was excellent for
BC-6800, XN-module, and XE-2100 (Bias 0.023, 0.019, and 0.033×109 /L,
respectively). ADVIA 2120i displayed a significant constant error and UniCel DxH 
800 both proportional and small constant error.
CONCLUSION: Regards to NRBC counting, the performances shown by BC-6800,
XN-module, and XE-2100 are excellent also a low count, ADVIA 2120i and UniCel DxH
800 need to be improved.
