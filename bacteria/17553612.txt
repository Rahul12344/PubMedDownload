OBJECTIVE: Human CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells are hematopoietic progenitors useful
for stem cell transplantation, even after ex vivo expansion. We investigated the 
effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on lymphoid development from cultured CD34+
CB cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human CD34+ CB cells were cultured in cytokine mixes with 
or without TNF. Preculture during 60 hours was followed by in vitro
differentiation assays, including fetal thymus organ culture and coculture on
murine stromal MS-5 cells. In a next step, experiments were extended to
CD34+CD38- and CD34+CD38+ CB cells and prolonged preculture.
RESULTS: Preculture in the presence of TNF improved differentiation into T cells 
and diminished the ability to generate B cells, while NK potential and myeloid
development were unaffected. Sorted CD34+CD38- CB cells were more potent T-cell
precursors after preculture in TNF, compared to CD34+CD38+ CB cells. In
precultured CD34+CD38- CB cells, TNF increased GATA3 but decreased EBF1
expression, in line with the skewed lymphoid differentiation induced by TNF.
However, when preculture in the presence of TNF was extended to 1 week, T-cell
precursors were lost.
CONCLUSION: After short-term culture of CD34+ CB cells in the presence of TNF,
T-cell generation is stimulated at the expense of B-cell generation. T-cell
progenitors are enriched in the CD34+CD38- fraction. These results have
implications on the culture conditions to be used for CB CD34+ cells prior to
transplantation.
