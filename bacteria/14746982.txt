In the present study, we report the effect of several acaricides on the enzyme
activity of a Boophilus microplus recombinant glutathione S-transferase (rGST).
GST was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified with glutathione (GSH)
affinity column chromatography. The kinetic constants were determined by reacting
GST with the substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione. We
report the effect of several acaricides on the enzyme activity of rGST. Some
acaricides (ethion, amitraz, chlorpyrifos, DDT, cypermethrin, diazinon,
ivermectin, deltamethrin and flumethrin) inhibited rGST. Contrarily, coumaphos
had an activating effect. Although the accurate mechanisms of the B. microplus
resistance to acaricides remain elusive, this work helps in understanding how
acaricides can interact with GST.
