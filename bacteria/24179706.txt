The CD1d-dependent presentation of lipid antigens to natural killer T (NKT) cells
is an integral part of the innate immune system. However, the development of
anticancer therapies based on NKT-cell agonists has had limited success so far.
Humanizing mice with respect to the CD1d/NKT antigen presentation system will
provide a tool to identify novel lipids that exert antineoplastic functions by
targeting NKT cells before the initiation of costly and lengthy clinical trials.
