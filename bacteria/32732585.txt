Cardiac myxoma is an uncommon benign mesenchymal neoplasm of the heart. It
usually arises in the left atrium, near the valve of the fossa ovalis, and most
frequently affects adults in the third through the sixth decades of life. It is
hypothesized to arise from subendothelial vasoformative reserve cells or
primitive cells that differentiate along the lines of the endothelium, but this
remains speculative. Microscopically, the neoplastic cells are arranged
individually, and nests, and are oriented in single or multiple layers around
vascular channels. The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for vimentin,
calretinin, S100, nonspecific enolase, factor VIII, CD31, and CD34. The tumor can
have diverse clinical presentations depending on its location and extent of
disease and is predisposed to embolization. The current treatment is prompt
surgical excision.
