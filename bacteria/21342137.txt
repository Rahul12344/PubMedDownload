The first genetic factors to be identified as important in the pathogenesis of
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were those of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) on chromosome 6. It is now widely accepted that MHC genes
constitute a part of the genetic susceptibility to SLE. The study population
comprised 61 SLE patients fulfilling at least four of the American college of
Rheumatology criteria for SLE and 61 healthy blood donors as controls. SLE female
versus male ratio was approximately 9:1. Mean age at diagnosis was 30.35 Â± 1.687 
(12-68 years). DNA-based HLA Typing for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 was carried
out by Polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers using genomic DNA
obtained from blood samples. A total of 22 alleles have been studied at locus A, 
37 alleles at locus B and 17 DRB1 alleles. The allelic frequencies of HLA-A,
HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 antigens in SLE patients from Pakistan were compared with the
controls. A significant increase was observed in the frequency of HLA-A*01, A*03,
A*11, A*23, A*26 A*69, HLA-B*27, B*40, B*49, B*51, B*52, B*53, B*54, B*95,
HLA-DRBI*01, DRBI*03, DRBI*11, DRBI*14 among SLE patients indicating a positive
association of these alleles with SLE. HLA-A*24, A*29, A*31, A*34, A*68, A*92,
HLA-B*18, HLA-DRB1*12, were found to be decreased in the patient group as
compared to controls indicating a negative association of these alleles with SLE.
Thus from this study we can conclude that SLE is associated with certain MHC
alleles in Pakistani population.
