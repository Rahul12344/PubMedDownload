BACKGROUND: Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) is used during periodontal surgery for
the regeneration of periodontal tissue. It consists of the amelogenin fraction of
porcine enamel matrix (AMEL) suspended in a vehicle of propylene glycol alginate 
(PGA). EMD-treated sites appear to heal with less inflammation. It has been
suggested that antimicrobial properties of EMD might account for improved healing
in vivo. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the antibacterial
effects of EMD on the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and 2) to
establish the component(s) of EMD that are responsible for this effect.
METHODS: The antimicrobial effects were determined in vitro using the broth
dilution assay. P. gingivalis at a starting inoculum of 10(9) colony forming
units/ml was treated with EMD, AMEL, and PGA in Hank's balanced salt solution
(HBSS) for 1, 3, and 24 hours. The CFU/ml of P. gingivalis recovered on enriched 
Brucella blood agar was determined at 6 and 10 days.
RESULTS: EMD (containing AMEL and PGA) or PGA alone eliminated recoverable CFUs
of P. gingivalis. Interestingly, AMEL in HBSS increased recoverable CFUs from
8.62 log CFU/ml to 8.93 log CFU/ml. Further analysis of the dose response at
concentrations of 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/ml of AMEL in HBSS revealed that only 30
mg/ml (clinical concentration) increased CFUs of P. gingivalis relative to
baseline (from 8.8 log CFU/ml to 9.2 log CFU/ml in 3 hours). Additionally, AMEL
was compared to a protein control bovine serum albumin (BSA) to determine whether
this effect was unique to AMEL. A marked increase in recoverable CFUs occurred
with the AMEL (increasing from 8.8 log CFU/ml to 9.47 log CFU/ml), but not with
BSA.
CONCLUSIONS: EMD possesses antimicrobial properties that can be attributed to the
propylene glycol alginate vehicle. The amelogenin fraction of porcine enamel
matrix in enamel matrix derivative (i.e., AMEL) is not antibacterial for P.
gingivalis and was shown to increase recoverable CFUs.
