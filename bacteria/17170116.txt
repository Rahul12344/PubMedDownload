Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be catabolized by many microorganisms using
intra- or extracellular PHA depolymerases. Most of our current knowledge of these
intracellular enzyme-coding genes comes from the analysis of short chain length
PHA depolymerases, whereas medium chain length PHA (mcl-PHA) intracellular
depolymerization systems still remained to be characterized. The phaZ gene of
some Pseudomonas putida strains has been identified only by mutagenesis and
complementation techniques as putative intracellular mcl-PHA depolymerase.
However, none of their corresponding encoded PhaZ enzymes have been characterized
in depth. In this study the PhaZ depolymerase from P. putida KT2442 has been
purified and biochemically characterized after its overexpression in Escherichia 
coli. To facilitate these studies we have developed a new and very sensitive
radioactive method for detecting PHA hydrolysis in vitro. We have demonstrated
that PhaZ is an intracellular depolymerase that is located in PHA granules and
that hydrolyzes specifically mcl-PHAs containing aliphatic and aromatic monomers.
The enzyme behaves as a serine hydrolase that is inhibited by
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of
PhaZ complexed with a 3-hydroxyoctanoate dimer. Using this model, we found that
the enzyme appears to be built up from a corealpha/beta hydrolase-type domain
capped with a lid structure with an active site containing a catalytic triad
buried near the connection between domains. All these data constitute the first
biochemical characterization of PhaZ and allow us to propose this enzyme as the
paradigmatic representative of intracellular endo/exo-mcl-PHA depolymerases.
