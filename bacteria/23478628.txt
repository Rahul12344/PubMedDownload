Genetic and epigenetic alterations in cervical carcinomas were investigated using
NotI-microarrays containing 180 cloned sequences flanking all NotI-sites
associated with genes on chromosome 3. In total, 48 paired normal/tumor DNA
samples, specifically enriched in NotI-sites, were hybridized to
NotI-microarrays. Thirty genes, including tumor suppressors or candidates (for
example, VHL, RBSP3/CTDSPL, ITGA9, LRRC3B, ALDH1L1, EPHB1) and genes previously
unknown as cancer-associated (ABHD5, C3orf77, PRL32, LOC285375, FGD5 and others),
showed methylation/deletion in 21-44% of tumors. The genes were more frequently
altered in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) than in adenocarcinomas (ADC, p<0.01). 
A set of seven potential markers (LRRN1, PRICKLE2, VHL, BHLHE40, RBSP3, CGGBP1
and SOX14) is promising for discrimination of ADC and SCC. Alterations of more
than 20 genes simultaneously were revealed in 23% of SCC. Bisulfite sequencing
analysis confirmed methylation as a frequent event in SCC. High down-regulation
frequency was shown for RBSP3, ITGA9, VILL, APRG1/C3orf35 and RASSF1 (isoform A) 
genes (3p21.3 locus) in SCC. Both frequency and extent of RASSF1A and RBSP3 mRNA 
level decrease were more pronounced in tumors with lymph node metastases compared
with non-metastatic ones (p â‰¤ 0.05). We confirmed by bisulfite sequencing that
RASSF1 promoter methylation was a rare event in SCC and, for the first time,
demonstrated RASSF1A down-regulation at both the mRNA and protein levels without 
promoter methylation in tumors of this histological type. Thus, our data revealed
novel tumor suppressor candidates located on chromosome 3 and a frequent loss of 
epigenetic stability of 3p21.3 locus in combination with down-regulation of genes
in cervical cancer.
