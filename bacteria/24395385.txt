p66Shc functions as a longevity protein in murine and exhibits oxidase activity
in regulating diverse biological activities. In this study, we investigated the
role of p66Shc protein in regulating ovarian cancer (OCa) cell proliferation.
Among three cell lines examined, the slowest growing OVCAR-3 cells have the
lowest level of p66Shc protein. Transient transfection with p66Shc cDNA
expression vector in OVCAR-3 cells increases cell proliferation. Conversely,
knock-down of p66Shc by shRNA in rapidly growing SKOV-3 cells results in
decreased cell growth. In estrogen (E2)-treated CaOV-3 cells, elevated p66Shc
protein level correlates with ROS level, ErbB-2 and ERK/MAPK activation, and cell
proliferation. Further, the E2-stimulated proliferation of CaOV-3 cells was
blocked by antioxidants and ErbB-2 inhibitor. Additionally, in E2-stimulated
cells, the tartrate-sensitive, but not the tartrate-resistant, phosphatase
activity decreases; concurrently, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2
increases. Conversely, inhibition of phosphatase activity by L(+)-tartrate
treatment increases p66Shc protein level, ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation,
ERK/MAPK activation, and cell growth. Further, inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway
by PD98059 blocks E2-induced ERK/MAPK activation and cell proliferation in CaOV-3
cells. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses showed that the p66Shc protein
level was significantly higher in cancerous cells than in noncancerous cells in
archival OCa tissues (n = 76; P = 0.00037). These data collectively indicate that
p66Shc protein plays a critical role in up-regulating OCa progression.
