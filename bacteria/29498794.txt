OBJECTIVES: To observe relationships between oral Candida status and salivary
human beta-defensin 2 and 3 (hBD-2 and hBD-3) levels in HIV/AIDS patients of
Guangxi, China during the first year of antiretroviral therapy (ART) dynamically,
and to understand the influence of ART on oral Candida status and salivary hBDs
expressions.
METHODS: A prospective self-controlled study was carried to observe the dynamic
changes of CD4+ T cell counts, oral Candida carriages and salivary hBD-2,3
expressions in HIV/AIDS patients during the first year of ART. A total of 90
HIV/AIDS patients were enrolled and were examined at the baseline, 3rd, 6th, 12th
month of ART. Thirty healthy individuals were enrolled as control. Peripheral
blood, oral rinse sample, and unstimulated whole saliva were collected to test
CD4+ T cell counts, oral Candida carriages, and hBD-2,3 expressions.
RESULTS: In the first year of ART, CD4+ T cell counts increased significantly.
However, oral Candida carriages and oral candidiasis decreased significantly, and
salivary hBD-2 expressions in HIV/AIDS patients decreased gradually, salivary
hBD-3 levels were highly variable. Salivary hBD-2 concentrations were positively 
related to oral Candida carriages.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of oral candidiasis among HIV/AIDS patients gradually 
decreased due to the immune reconstruction of ART. Salivary defensins might play 
an important role in Candida-host interaction in HIV/AIDS patients.
