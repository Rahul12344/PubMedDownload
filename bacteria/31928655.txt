Lysine (K) 63-linked polyubiquitination plays important roles in cellular
processes including DNA-damage tolerance (DDT), NF-κB signaling and endocytosis. 
Compared to yeast and mammals, little is known about K63-linked
polyubiquitination in plants. To date, a Uev-Ubc13 complex is the only known
Ub-conjugating enzyme to catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitination, in which Uev
serves as a regulatory subunit. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains four
UEV1 genes that can be classified into two subfamilies (UEV1A/B and UEV1C/D), in 
which Uev1A/B have a C-terminal extension. Database analysis reveals that all
higher plant genomes contain both subfamily UEV1s, which were evolved as early as
angiosperm plants. Interestingly, all C-terminal tails in the Uev1A/B subfamily
contain a putative prenylation motif, CaaX. Combined experimental results using
AtUev1B demonstrated that it is most likely farnesylated and that its C-terminal 
tail, particularly the catalytic Cys residue in the CaaX motif, plays critical
roles in protein-protein interaction, nuclear exclusion and membrane association.
Using AtUev1B as bait for a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we identified 14 interaction
proteins in a prenylation-dependent manner. These results collectively imply that
prenylation of AtUev1A/B plays a critical role in its functional differentiation 
from AtUev1C/D.
