Increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, in particular
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae,
presents a critical problem. Limited therapeutic options have forced infectious
disease clinicians and microbiologists to reappraise the clinical application of 
colistin, a polymyxin antibiotic discovered more than 50 years ago. We summarise 
recent progress in understanding the complex chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and
pharmacodynamics of colistin, the interplay between these three aspects, and
their effect on the clinical use of this important antibiotic. Recent clinical
findings are reviewed, focusing on evaluation of efficacy, emerging resistance,
potential toxicities, and combination therapy. In the battle against rapidly
emerging bacterial resistance we can no longer rely entirely on the discovery of 
new antibiotics; we must also pursue rational approaches to the use of older
antibiotics such as colistin.
