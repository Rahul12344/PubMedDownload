SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) recognize SUMOylated proteins with high
specificity allowing to connect SUMO-modified proteins. Multiple SIMs fused to
distinct tags have been used to increase their affinity and generate more
efficient purification tools. Enrichment of SUMOylated proteins using SIMs
arranged in tandem (SUMO-traps) facilitates the identification and
characterization of protein targets in vitro and in vivo. Here a protocol to
produce biotinylated SUMO-traps (bioSUBEs) to capture SUMO chains and typical
SUMOylated proteins such as p53 or IkBÎ± is presented. Biotinylated SUMO-traps
represent an alternative to reduce the background associated to bigger tags,
e.g., during mass spectrometry analysis. Consequently, bioSUBEs are alternative
tools to characterize endogenous SUMO targets.
