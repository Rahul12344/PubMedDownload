Holliday junctions (four-way DNA junctions), formed during homologous
recombination, are bound and resolved by junction-specific endonucleases to yield
recombinant duplex DNA products. The junction-resolving enzymes are a
structurally diverse class of proteins that nevertheless have many properties in 
common; in particular a high structure specificity for binding and
metal-dependent, (frequently) sequence-specific cleavage activity. In
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzyme CCE1 is necessary for the resolution of
recombining mitochondrial genomes, and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe the
homologous protein YDC2 is thought to have a similar function. We have generated 
an inactive mutant of YDC2, D226N, that retains structure-specific junction
binding and have analysed the interaction of this protein with the four-way DNA
junction. YDC2 binds the four-way junction in two specific complexes (I and II), 
unfolding the stacked X-structure into a conformation where the arms extend to
the four corners of a square. This structure is reminiscent of that of the free
junction in the absence of metal ions and of the structures imposed on the
Holliday junction by CCE1 and RuvA. DNase I probing reveals footprints specific
for complexes I and II which extend from the junction centre on all four arms. No
protection is observed with the small, hydrophobic probe DMS.
