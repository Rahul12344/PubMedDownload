Human-β-defensins 1-3 (HBD-1-3) and their C-terminal analogs Phd-1-3 do not show 
antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli in the presence of mono- and
divalent cations. Activity of peptides was examined against E. coli pretreated
with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and salt remedial
Escherichia coli ftsEX, a deletion mutant of FtsEX complex [an ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter protein], in the presence of Na(+), Ca(2+), and
Mg(2+). Activity was observed in the presence of Na(+) and Ca(2+), although not
in the presence of Mg(2+) against E. coli, when proton motive force (PMF) was
dissipated by CCCP. The peptides exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli
ftsEX even in the presence of Na(+) and Ca(2+). Our results indicate that HBD-1-3
and Phd-1-3 do not require PMF for their antibacterial activity. The absence of
activity against E. coli in the presence of Na(+) and Ca(2+) ions is due to not
only weakened electrostatic interactions with anionic membrane components, but
also involvement of electrochemical gradients. However, Mg(2+) prevents
electrostatic interaction of the peptides with the outer membrane resulting in
loss of activity.
