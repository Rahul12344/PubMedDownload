Importance: Visitor contact precautions (VCPs) are commonly used to reduce the
transmission of Clostridioides difficile at health care institutions.
Implementing VCPs requires considerable personnel and personal protective
equipment resources. However, it is unknown whether VCPs are associated with
reduced hospital-onset C difficile infection (HO-CDI) rates.
Objective: To estimate the association between VCPs and HO-CDI rates using
simulation modeling.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This simulation study, conducted between July 
27, 2020, and August 11, 2020, used an established agent-based simulation model
of C difficile transmission in a 200-bed acute care adult hospital to estimate
the association between VCPs and HO-CDI while varying assumptions about factors
such as patient susceptibility, behavior, and C difficile transmission. The model
simulated hospital activity for 1 year among a homogeneous, simulated adult
population.
Interventions: No VCP use vs ideal use of VCPs under different hospital
configurations.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The rate of HO-CDI per 10 000 patient-days according 
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of HO-CDI.
Results: With use of the simulation model, the baseline rate of HO-CDI was 7.94
10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.91-7.98 per 10 000 patient-days) with no VCP use
compared with 7.97 per 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.93-8.01 per 10 000
patient-days) with ideal VCP use. Visitor contact precautions were not associated
with a reduction of more than 1% in HO-CDI rates in any of the tested scenarios
and hospital settings. Independently increasing the hand-hygiene compliance of
the average health care worker and environmental cleaning compliance by no more
than 2% each was associated with greater HO-CDI reduction compared with all other
scenarios, including VCPs.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this simulation study, the association between VCPs
and HO-CDI was minimal, but improvements in health care worker hand hygiene and
environmental cleaning were associated with greater reductions in estimated
HO-CDI. Hospitals may achieve a higher rate of reduction for HO-CDI by focusing
on making small improvements in compliance with interventions other than VCP.
