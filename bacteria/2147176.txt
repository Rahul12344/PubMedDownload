Adherence of sheep erythrocytes (E) sensitized with IgM antibodies (A) and C3b
(EAC3b) to C3b/C4b receptors (CR1) in cryostat sections of human renal glomeruli 
was studied using the closed chamber technique. The adsorption was stable for at 
least 3 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of purified factor I, the indicator
cells, however, detached from the sections after 30 min at 37 degrees C. Factor H
was not required. The release was not due to loss of CR1 activity in the tissue. 
The detached indicator cells were negative in the immune adherence test and were 
agglutinated by antibody to C3d, but not by antibody to C3c. Western blot of the 
detached indicator cells revealed the presence of C3d and C3c was found in the
chamber fluid. Accordingly, detachment of the indicator cells was due to
degradation of C3b to C3d with the release of C3c into the chamber fluid.
Protease inhibitors did not prevent the detachment of the indicator cells. EAC3b 
incubated with sections of renal glomeruli preincubated with anti-CR1 antibody
were not degraded. The results therefore indicate that CR1 in situ in renal
glomeruli can provide the necessary cofactor activity for factor I-mediated
degradation of C3b to C3d and C3c.
