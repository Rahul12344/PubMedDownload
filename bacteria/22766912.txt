Platform chemicals composed of 2-6 carbons derived from fossil resources are used
as important precursors for making a variety of chemicals and materials,
including solvents, fuels, polymers, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and foods. Due to
concerns regarding our environment and the limited nature of fossil resources,
however, increasing interest has focused on the development of sustainable
technologies for producing these platform chemicals from renewable resources. The
techniques and strategies for developing microbial strains for chemicals
production have advanced rapidly, and it is becoming feasible to develop microbes
for producing additional types of chemicals, including non-natural molecules. In 
this study, we review the current status of the bio-based production of major
C2-C6 platform chemicals, focusing on the microbial production of platform
chemicals that have been used for the production of chemical intermediates,
building block compounds, and polymers.
