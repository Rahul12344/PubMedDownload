2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD) can be produced at high titers by engineered
Saccharomyces cerevisiae by abolishing the ethanol biosynthetic pathway and
introducing the bacterial butanediol-producing pathway. However, production of
2,3-BD instead of ethanol by engineered S. cerevisiae has resulted in glycerol
production because of surplus NADH accumulation caused by a lower degree of
reduction (γ = 5.5) of 2,3-BD than that (γ = 6) of ethanol. In order to eliminate
glycerol production and resolve redox imbalance during 2,3-BD production, both
GPD1 and GPD2 coding for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases were disrupted after
overexpressing NADH oxidase from Lactococcus lactis. As disruption of the GPD
genes caused growth defects due to limited supply of C2 compounds, Candida
tropicalis PDC1 was additionally introduced to provide a necessary amount of C2
compounds while minimizing ethanol production. The resulting strain (BD5_T2
nox_dGPD1,2_CtPDC1) produced 99.4 g/L of 2,3-BD with 0.5 g/L glycerol
accumulation in a batch culture. The fed-batch fermentation led to production of 
108.6 g/L 2,3-BD with a negligible amount of glycerol production, resulting in a 
high BD yield (0.462 g2,3-BD/gglucose) corresponding to 92.4 % of the theoretical
yield. These results demonstrate that glycerol-free production of 2,3-BD by
engineered yeast is feasible.
