We work on the assumption that four major specialities or sectors of medical
laboratory assays, comprising clinical chemistry, haematology, immunology, and
microbiology, embraced by genome sequencing techniques, are routinely in use.
Medical laboratory markers for inflammation serve as model: they are allotted to 
most fields of medical lab assays including genomics. Incessant coding of assays 
aligns each of them in the long lists of big data. As exemplified with the
complement gene family, containing C2, C3, C8A, C8B, CFH, CFI, and ITGB2,
heritability patterns/risk factors associated with diseases with genetic glitch
of complement components are unfolding. The C4 component serum levels depend on
sufficient vitamin D whilst low vitamin D is inversely related to IgG1, IgA, and 
C3 linking vitamin sufficiency to innate immunity. Whole genome sequencing of
microbial organisms may distinguish virulent from nonvirulent and antibiotic
resistant from nonresistant varieties of the same species and thus can be listed 
in personal big data banks including microbiological pathology; the big data
warehouse continues to grow.
