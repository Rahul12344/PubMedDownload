[Central metabolic characteristics of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture degrading 
DDT].

[Article in Russian]

Mal'tseva OV, Golovleva LA.

The object of this work was to investigate the operation of enzymes of the citric
acid cycle, the glyoxylate pathway, the glucose metabolism as well as of pyruvate
and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 640x capable of
complete degradation of DDT under the conditions of cometabolism. The activity of
isocitrate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases producing reduced NADP, which
is required for reductive dechlorination of DDT, appears to be high. Pyruvate
carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31.) function
simultaneously in the culture. Differences in the pathways of anaplerotic carbon 
dioxide fixation were found in P. aeruginosa 640x and the collection strain of P.
aeruginosa PAO incapable of DDT degradation.
