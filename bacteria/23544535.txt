The mucoadhesive property of chitosan, especially in an acidic (<pH 6.0)
environment, was increased by conjugating an aromatic sulfonamide group at the
C2-N position of chitosan. Four different feeding ratios of
4-carboxybenzensulfonamide (4-CBS) to chitosan in the presence of
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride as a coupling agent 
were investigated. The 0.2:1 (w/w) ratio 4-CBS:chitosan revealed a 20-fold
stronger mucoadhesion to mucin type II than the native chitosan in the simulated 
gastric fluid (SGF; pH 1.2), and a swelling ratio after 1 h in water, SGF and
simulated intestinal fluid (pH 7.4) of about 2.9-, 3.0- and 3.4-fold higher than 
that of chitosan, respectively. In tissue culture, the 4-CBS-chitosan, like
chitosan, were found to be non-cytotoxic to the Vero, KB, MCF-7 and NCI-H187 cell
lines but showed potential antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and
Staphlyococcus aureus as model gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria,
respectively.
