The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a potent growth suppressor and
proapototic factor, whereas aberrant fusions of PML and retinoic acid receptor
(RAR)-alpha are causal agents in human acute promyelocytic leukemia. Arsenic
trioxide (As(2)O(3)) treatment induces apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia 
cells through an incompletely understood mechanism. We report here that As(2)O(3)
treatment induces phosphorylation of the PML protein through a mitogen-activated 
protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Increased PML phosphorylation is associated with
increased sumoylation of PML and increased PML-mediated apoptosis. Conversely,
MAP kinase cascade inhibitors, or the introduction of phosphorylation or
sumoylation-defective mutations of PML, impair As(2)O(3)-mediated apoptosis by
PML. We conclude that phosphorylation by MAP kinase cascades potentiates the
antiproliferative functions of PML and helps mediate the proapoptotic effects of 
As(2)O(3).
