We describe a simple bioinformatics method for biomarker discovery that is based 
on the analysis of global transcript levels in a population of inbred mouse
strains showing variation for disease-related traits. This method has advantages 
such as controlled environment and accessibility to heart and plasma tissue in
the preclinical selection stage. We illustrate the approach by identifying
candidate heart failure (HF) biomarkers by overlaying mouse transcriptome and
clinical traits from 91 Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) inbred strains and
human HF transcriptome from the Myocardial Applied Genomics Network (MAGNet)
consortium. We found that some of the top differentially expressed genes
correlated with known human HF biomarkers, such as galectin-3 and tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. Using ELISA assays, we investigated one novel
candidate, Glycoprotein NMB, in a mouse model of chronic β-adrenergic stimulation
by isoproterenol (ISO) induced HF. We observed significantly lower GPNMB plasma
levels in the ISO model compared to the control group (p-value = 0.007). In
addition, we assessed GPNMB plasma levels among 389 HF cases and controls from
the METabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) study. Lower levels of GPNMB were also
observed in patients with HF from the METSIM study compared to non-HF controls
(p-value < 0.0001). In summary, we have identified several candidate biomarkers
for HF using the cardiac transcriptome data in a population of mice that may be
directly relevant and applicable to human populations.
