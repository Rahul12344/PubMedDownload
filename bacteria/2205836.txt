The size of repair patch made by E. coli DNA polymerase I (Poll) following the
removal of a thymine-psoralen monoadduct by E. coli (A)BC excinuclease was
determined by using an M13mp19 DNA with a single psoralen monoadduct at the
polylinker region. Incubation of this substrate with (A)BC excinuclease, Poll and
a combination of 3 dnTP plus 1 dNTP(alpha S) for each nucleotide, and DNA ligase 
resulted in a repair patch with phosphorothioate linkages. The preferential
hydrolysis of phosphorothioate bonds by heating in iodoethanol revealed a patch
size--with minimal nick translation--equal in length to the 12 nucleotide gap
generated by this excision nuclease.
