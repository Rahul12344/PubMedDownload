Antibiotics are important in the prophylaxis and treatment of surgical infections
as well as in the management of nosocomial infections acquired postoperatively in
surgical patients. Surgeons encounter a range of infectious conditions, including
established single-pathogen infections of soft tissues, polymicrobial
intra-abdominal infections, and resistant gram-negative nosocomial infections
such as ventilator-associated and aspiration pneumonia. Preoperative antibiotic
administration has been shown to reduce the risk of surgical site infections and 
is now an accepted part of the standard care for most surgical patients. In
patients with established single-pathogen or polymicrobial infections requiring
surgery, studies have shown appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy to be an
important adjunct to surgical intervention and general supportive measures in
improving patient outcome. Antibiotics are also essential for those who develop
postoperative nosocomial infections. Empiric coverage of the most likely
causative organisms, especially in synergistic polymicrobial mixed infections, is
one of the keys to successful prophylaxis and treatment of surgical infections.
