BACKGROUND: Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society. : Intestinal bacteria 
have long been implicated in colorectal cancer pathology, and many reports point 
to a close linkage between Streptococcus bovis biotype I (recently renamed
Streptococcus gallolyticus) infections and tumors of the human colon. This work
aims to investigate the humoral immune response to this bacterium during
different stages of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: The presence of serum antibodies against S. bovis antigen RpL7/L12,
previously assigned as a potential diagnostic antigen, was evaluated in Dutch (n 
= 209) and American (n = 112) populations using a newly developed enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The analyses consistently showed that an immune response against this
bacterial antigen was increased in polyp patients and stage I/II colorectal
cancer patients as compared with asymptomatic individuals. This was not
paralleled by increased antibody production to endotoxin, an intrinsic cell wall 
component of the majority of intestinal bacteria, which implies that the humoral 
immune response against RpL7/L12 is not a general phenomenon induced by the loss 
of colonic barrier function. Notably, increased anti-RpL7/L12 levels were not or 
were only mildly detected in late stage colorectal cancer patients having lymph
node or distant metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society. : These findings are 
indicative of an increased exposure to antigen RpL7/L12 during early stages of
colon carcinogenesis and suggest that intestinal bacteria such as S. bovis
constitute a risk factor for the progression of premalignant lesions into early
stage carcinomas. Clearly, the current findings emphasize the necessity for
further studies on the possible etiologic relationship between intestinal
bacteria and human colorectal cancer.
