Antigen-presenting cells, in addition to presenting processed antigen, provide
co-stimulatory signals that are necessary for stimulating maximal lymphokine
production by CD4+ T cells. For interleukin 2 (IL-2)-producing CD4+ T cells, the 
B7 molecule provides an important co-stimulatory signal through interaction with 
its ligand on the T-cell surface, CD28. Populations of antigen-presenting cells
that express high levels of B7 (e.g., dendritic cells) are much more potent
stimulators of T-cell activation than cells that fail to express B7 (e.g.,
resting B cells). An increase in B7 expression could therefore explain the
increased accessory function gained by Langerhans cells as they leave the skin
and migrate to the draining lymph node.
