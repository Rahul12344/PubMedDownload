Loss of IL-7Ralpha is associated with CD4 T-cell depletion, high interleukin-7
levels and CD28 down-regulation in HIV infected patients.

OBJECTIVE: Elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-7 are present in the blood of
HIV-positive patients and it is known that IL-7 receptor (IL-7R)alpha expression 
decreases on T cells during HIV infection. The subset(s) of T cells with low
IL-7Ralpha and the consequence of low IL-7Ralpha expression for T-cell survival
are poorly characterized.
DESIGN: The frequency of IL-7Ralpha-negative T cells in HIV-positive patients was
studied in relation to CD4 T-cell counts, IL-7 concentration and survival in
culture. We analysed IL-7Ralpha expression in different T-cell populations and in
relation to Bcl-2 expression.
METHODS: Specimens from 38 HIV-1 patients and 17 controls were examined.
IL-7Ralpha and Bcl-2 expression in different T-cell populations was studied by
flow cytometry. The influence of IL-7Ralpha expression on T-cell survival was
studied by culturing T cells in the presence of IL-7.
RESULTS: Down-regulation of IL-7Ralpha on T cells correlated with depletion of
CD4 T cells (P < 0.001) and also with increased concentration of serum IL-7 (P < 
0.05). The decreased IL-7Ralpha expression was associated with low Bcl-2
expression and with the reduced survival capacity of T cells in the presence of
IL-7 in vitro. Particularly, T cells with memory phenotype showed a decreased
IL-7Ralpha expression in association with CD28 down-regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The positive effects of IL-7 on survival and homeostatic
proliferation of T cells might be severely impaired in HIV-infected individuals
due to IL-7Ralpha down-regulation. Differentiation towards a CD28-negative memory
phenotype in response to chronic activation may lead to an overall decrease of
IL-7 mediated survival within the peripheral T-cell pool.
