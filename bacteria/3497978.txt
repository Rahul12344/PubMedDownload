Anti-HLA class I antibodies inhibit the T cell-independent proliferation of human
B lymphocytes.

Taylor DS, Nowell PC, Kornbluth J.

The role of major histocompatibility complex-encoded class I molecules in the
proliferation of human B lymphocytes is presently unclear. This question was
addressed by investigating the effect of three individually derived anti-HLA
class I monoclonal antibodies (mAb) on purified human B cells (less than 1.5% T
cells) stimulated by either the T-independent mitogen Staphylococcus aureus or
the phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. The three anti-HLA class I
antibodies, whether specific for gene products of the HLA-A locus (mAb 131),
HLA-B locus (mAb 4E), or HLA-A, -B, and -C locus (mAb W6/32), inhibited S.
aureus-induced proliferation by 70 to 90%. This inhibition was significant over a
5-day culture period, was not altered by the addition of exogenous interleukin 2 
or B cell growth factor, and was not due to nonspecific cytotoxicity. In
addition, the inhibition of proliferation was unchanged when the mAb were added
12 hr after the initiation of culture. The proliferative response was not
affected by either of the control antibodies OKB7 and R3-367. In contrast with S.
aureus-stimulated B cells, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced proliferation 
was resistant to the inhibitory activity of HLA class I-specific antibodies.
These results suggest that HLA class I molecules are involved in human B
lymphocyte proliferation and may regulate a critical event preceding the
upregulation of protein kinase C activity.
