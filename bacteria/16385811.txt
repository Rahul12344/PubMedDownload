Flavobacterium psychrophilum infection in salmonid fish, known as rainbow trout
fry syndrome (RTFS) or bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), is widespread in fish 
farms and natural waters. Despite many studies in which attempts at infection
were made, an adequate method of infection has not yet been established. In this 
study, we evaluated a bath infection method in which we used bacteria at
different stages of growth in the infection of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.
Rainbow trout with a mean body weight of 1.3 or 5.6 g, respectively, were
infected by immersion in a bacterial suspension at different stages of growth (18
to 66 h shaking culture at 15 degrees C). The fish immersed in a logarithmic
phase culture showed higher mortality than those in other culture phases. Indeed,
1.3 and 5.6 g fish showed typical clinical signs including ulcerative tissue of
the trunk and lack of caudal fin edge. F. psychrophilum was detected by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in these tissue samples. These results indicate that
experimental bath infection using a logarithmic phase bacterial solution is the
most appropriate method for studies of infectious mechanisms.
