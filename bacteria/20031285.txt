The transformation of DDT was studied in an anaerobic system of dissimilatory
iron-reducing bacteria (Shewanella decolorationis S12) and iron oxide
(alpha-FeOOH). The results showed that S. decolorationis could reduce DDT into
DDD, and DDT transformation rate was accelerated by the presence of alpha-FeOOH. 
DDD was observed as the primary transformation product, which was demonstrated to
be transformed in the abiotic system of Fe(2+)+alpha-FeOOH and the system of
DIRB+alpha-FeOOH. The intermediates of DDMS and DBP were detected after 9 months,
likely suggesting that reductive dechlorination was the main dechlorination
pathway of DDT in the iron-reducing system. The enhanced reductive dechlorination
of DDT was mainly due to biogenic Fe(II) sorbed on the surface of alpha-FeOOH,
which can serve as a mediator for the transformation of DDT. This study
demonstrated the important role of DIRB and iron oxide on DDT and DDD
transformation under anaerobic iron-reducing environments.
