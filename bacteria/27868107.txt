Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes having vital functions in innate and
adaptive immunity, as well as placental reproduction. Controlling education and
functional activity of human NK cells are various receptors that recognize HLA
class I on the surface of tissue cells. Epitopes of polymorphic HLA-A,-B and -C
are recognized by equally diverse killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIR). In addition, a peptide cleaved from the leader sequence of HLA-A,-B or -C 
must bind to HLA-E for it to become a ligand for the conserved CD94:NKG2A
receptor. Methionine/threonine dimorphism at position -21 of the leader sequence 
divides HLA-B allotypes into a majority having -21T that do not supply HLA-E
binding peptides and a minority having -21M, that do. Genetic analysis of human
populations worldwide shows how haplotypes with -21M HLA-B rarely encode the KIR 
ligands: Bw4+HLA-B and C2+HLA-C KIR. Thus there are two fundamental forms of HLA 
haplotype: one preferentially supplying CD94:NKG2A ligands, the other
preferentially supplying KIR ligands. -21 HLA-B dimorphism divides the human
population into three groups: M/M, M/T and T/T. Mass cytometry and assays of
immune function, shows how M/M and M/T individuals have CD94:NKG2A+ NK cells
which are better educated, phenotypically more diverse and functionally more
potent than those in T/T individuals. Fundamental new insights are given to
genetic control of NK cell immunity and the evolution that has limited the number
of NK cell receptor ligands encoded by an HLA haplotype. These finding suggest
new ways to dissect the numerous clinical associations with HLA class I.
