Glucose tolerance, lymphocyte populations, and HLA types were studied in 27
patients with untreated hidradenitis suppurativa; 18 of these patients had a
negative history for acne vulgaris. Six patients (22%) had an increased incidence
of impaired glucose tolerance. We failed to confirm a previous report of high
incidence of flat glucose tolerance curves. The frequency of HLA-A and HLA-B
antigen loci and the median values of peripheral blood T lymphocytes were similar
to the control population. However, seven patients with moderate or severe
clinical disease had a marked reduction in T lymphocytes and these patients had
an increased frequency of the HLA antigens, A1 and B8. These results suggest that
T lymphocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa and
that HLA-A1 and HLA-B8 may predispose the patient to more severe disease, but
further research is necessary to clarify this.
