There are many biological contexts in which DNA damage generates "dirty" breaks
with 3'-PO4 (or cyclic-PO4) and 5'-OH ends that cannot be sealed by DNA ligases. 
Here we show that the Escherichia coli RNA ligase RtcB can splice these dirty DNA
ends via a unique chemical mechanism. RtcB transfers GMP from a covalent RtcB-GMP
intermediate to a DNA 3'-PO4 to form a "capped" 3' end structure, DNA3'pp5'G.
When a suitable DNA 5'-OH end is available, RtcB catalyzes attack of the 5'-OH on
DNA3'pp5'G to form a 3'-5' phosphodiester splice junction. Our findings unveil an
enzymatic capacity for DNA 3' capping and the sealing of DNA breaks with 3'-PO4
and 5'-OH termini, with implications for DNA repair and DNA rearrangements.
