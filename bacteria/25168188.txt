The DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) is an extremely deleterious DNA lesion that
covalently crosslinks complementary strands and prevents the strand-separation
reaction. In higher eukaryotes, the Fanconi anemia proteins, FANCI and FANCD2,
form a heterodimer and play essential roles in ICL repair. Human FANCI and FANCD2
are large proteins with molecular masses of 149kDa and 164kDa, respectively, and 
were reportedly purified using a baculovirus expression system with insect cells.
We have established a novel expression and purification procedure for human
FANCD2 and FANCI, using Escherichia coli cells. The human FANCD2 and FANCI
proteins purified by this bacterial expression method formed a stable
heterodimer, and exhibited DNA binding and histone chaperone activities, as
previously reported for the proteins purified by the baculovirus system.
Therefore, these purification methods for human FANCI and FANCD2 provide novel
procedures to facilitate structural and biochemical studies of human FANCI and
FANCD2.
