Only one patient with cat-scratch disease (CSD) has been reported in Denmark. A
case and retrospective investigation among patients admitted to the ward is
presented. Over a period of 3.5 years, six patients were found to have suffered
from CSD. The yearly incidence was calculated to 2.6/100,000. The patients were
tested for antibodies against Bartonella (Rochalimaea) henselae with a new test
developed at the Danish Serum Institute. Only two of the patients with CSD had
titres of antibodies higher than 400 (positive). Tested again with an improved
test five of the six patients were found to have antibodies against B. henselae. 
It is assumed that CSD is found with the same incidence as the USA and Holland.
It is recommended that examination for chronic lymphadenopathy includes questions
about cat contact and testing for antibodies against Bartonella henselae.
