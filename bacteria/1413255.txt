Molecules of the transcriptional enzyme E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) have been
deposited using three different deposition methods: (1) passive adsorption onto
gold, (2) electrochemical adsorption onto gold and (3) adsorption onto mica. In
all cases SFM imaging was straightforward and reliable, and surface coverage by
the protein varied with deposition conditions as expected. To determine the
nature of the electrochemical treatment on the gold substrate, cyclic voltammetry
was performed with various chemical solutions. Finally, a comparison is made
between the SFM images of RNAP obtained with these methods and STM images
obtained earlier. Both STM and SFM show strikingly similar results; however,
heights and widths of individual molecules differ.
