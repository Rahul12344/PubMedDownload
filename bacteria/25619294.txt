OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of high glucose on
Porphyromonasgingivalis (Pg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulating human gingival 
fibroblasts (HGF) to secret the cytokines.
METHODS: HGF were obtained from the primary culture of the tissue explants. Cells
were divided into four groups, low glucose (5.5 mmol/L) + 1 mg/L Pg LPS (group
A);low glucose + 10 mg/L Pg LPS (group B); high glucose (25 mmol/L) +1 mg/L Pg
LPS(group C); high glucose+10 mg/L Pg LPS (group D). The levels of tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in cell supernatants were detected by
enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay at 6 h and 12 h. The expressions of toll-like 
receptor 2, 4 (TLR-2, 4) were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
After pretreatment with anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody in HGF, TNF-α
and L-1β levels were detected.
RESULTS: TNF-α concentration increased obviously in high glucose 6 h and 12 h
after Pg LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). IL-1β secretion increased (P < 0.01).
Meanwhile, TLR2, 4 mRNA expression increased, especially in high glucose+10 mg/L 
Pg LPS (P < 0.01). After inhibition of the TLR2, 4 in high glucose + 10 mg/L Pg
LPS respectively, TNF-α level [(297.16±11.49), (390.01±12.81) ng/L] decreased (F 
= 166.02, P < 0.01), and IL-1β level [(49.90±4.08), (99.35±5.01) ng/L] also
decreased (F = 153.51, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: High glucose may promote Pg LPS to stimulate the secretion of TNF-α 
and IL-1β through regulating TLR2, 4 expression, which suggests that the
elevating blood glucose precipitate in aggravating the process of periodontal
disease.
