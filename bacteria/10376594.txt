Caspase-9-mediated apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a central role in the 
development and homeostasis of all multicellular organisms. Mature caspase-9 is
derived from its procaspase precursor as a result of recruitment by the
activating factor Apaf-1. The crystal structures of the caspase-recruitment
domain of Apaf-1 by itself and in complex with the prodomain of procaspase-9 have
been determined at 1.6 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. These structures and
other evidence reveal that each molecule of Apaf-1 interacts with a molecule of
procaspase-9 through two highly charged and complementary surfaces formed by
non-conserved residues; these surfaces determine recognition specificity through 
networks of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.
Mutation of the important interface residues in procaspase-9 or Apaf-1 prevents
or reduces activation of procaspase-9 in a cell-free system. Wild-type, but not
mutant, prodomains of caspase-9 completely inhibit catalytic processing of
procaspase-9. Furthermore, analysis of homologues from Caenorhabditis elegans
indicates that recruitment of CED-3 by CED-4 is probably mediated by the same set
of conserved structural motifs, with a corresponding change in the
specificity-determining residues.
