BACKGROUND: We generated humanized/de-immunized immunotoxins targeting the
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and tested their cytotoxic activity
against prostate cancer cells in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The humanized/de-immunized version of our murine anti-PSMA
single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) D7, termed hD7-1(VL-VH), was ligated to the
40-kDa toxin domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE40), and to the
deimmunized 24-kDa toxin domains PE24 or PE24mut. The immunotoxins designated as 
hD7-1(VL-VH)-PE40, hD7-1(VL-VH)-PE24 and hD7-1(VL-VH)-PE24mut were bacterially
expressed and purified by affinity chromatography. Binding and cytotoxicity were 
examined by flow cytometry and viability assay, respectively.
RESULTS: All immunotoxins revealed strong binding to prostate cancer cells
expressing PSMA and specific cytotoxicity, with half-maximal inhibitory
concentration values in the picomolar range.
CONCLUSION: We successfully created powerful anti-PSMA immunotoxins with reduced 
immunogenicity for further clinical development and application against advanced 
prostate cancer.
