An efficient metabolic control approach was developed to improve the industrial
anaerobic fermentation of adenosylcobalamin (ado-cbl) by Propionibacterium
freudenreichii. The effects of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) on cell growth and
ado-cbl biosynthesis were investigated. Subsequently, the results obtained from
the batch culture showed that an important intermediate of ado-cbl separated from
the cell extract was identified as adenosylcobinamide (ado-cbi) by
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an ultraviolet diode array
detector and ESI mass spectrometry analysis. Ado-cbi can be converted to ado-cbl 
when linked to DMB, which is an essential compound for ado-cbi bioconversion.
This key ado-cbi is useful not only in determining ado-cbl concentration in the
fermentation process but also in serving as an effective compound to guide DMB
incorporation for the harvest of the maximum ado-cbl concentration. Accordingly, 
with scaling up to 100 L fermentation, the experimental results showed that the
discrepancy was less than 1 % using the developed prediction technique. Overall, 
the findings show that the method is efficient in evaluating the fermentation of 
ado-cbl by propionibacteria.
