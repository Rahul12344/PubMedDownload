The need for new environmentally friendly antifouling and the observation that
many marine organisms have developed strategies to keep their surface free of
epibionts has stimulated the search for marine natural compounds with antifouling
activities. Sponges and in particular fungi associated with them represent one of
the most appropriate sources of defence molecules and could represent a promising
biomass for the supply of new antifouling compounds. The objective of this work
was therefore to evaluate the antifouling potency of 7 compounds isolated from
the sponge derived fungus Eurotium chevalieri MUT 2316. The assessment of their
activity targeted the inhibition of the adhesion and/or growth of selected marine
bacteria (5) and microalgae (5), as well as the inhibition of the mussel's byssus
thread formation (tyrosinase activity). The 7 compounds showed bioactivity, with 
various levels of selectivity for species. Cyclo-L-Trp-L-Ala was the most
promising active compound, and led to the inhibition, at very low concentrations 
(0.001 μg ml-1 in 61.5% of cases), of adhesion and growth of all the microalgae, 
of selected bacteria, and towards the inhibition of tyrosinase. Promising results
were also obtained for echinulin, neoechinulin A, dihydroauroglaucin and
flavoglaucin, respectively, leading to inhibition of adhesion and/or growth of 9,
7, 8 and 8 microfouling species at various concentrations.
