The ontogenesis of Fc gamma receptors (FcR) and C3b/C4b receptors (CR1) was
studied in peripheral nerves from ten fetuses aged from 20 to 38 weeks using
immunohistochemical and functional assays. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
FcR and CR1 stained nerve fibers at 10 weeks of gestation and the staining
intensity increased during nerve maturation. FcR and CR1 are probably expressed
on Schwann cells and are early markers during the development of peripheral
nerves. Functional FcR activity was detected in nerve sections before initiation 
of myelination, which occurs at approximately 18-19 weeks, whereas functional CR1
activity was found in the sections after myelination. Functional CR1 activity
may, therefore, be related to myelin. The ontogenesis of FcR and CR1 was also
studied on Schwann cells in culture from three fetuses aged 14, 16 and 19 weeks, 
using immunofluorescence technique with mAbs. The FcR and CR1 are lost on
cultured Schwann cells. This suggests that the receptors are not intrinsic to the
cells or that Schwann cells require axonal contact for the expression of FcR and 
CR1.
