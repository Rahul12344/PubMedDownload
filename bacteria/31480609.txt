The enzyme selenocysteine β-lyase (SCLY) was first isolated in 1982 from pig
livers, followed by its identification in bacteria. SCLY works as a homodimer,
utilizing pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a cofactor, and catalyzing the specific
decomposition of the amino acid selenocysteine into alanine and selenide. The
enzyme is thought to deliver its selenide as a substrate for selenophosphate
synthetases, which will ultimately be reutilized in selenoprotein synthesis. SCLY
subcellular localization is unresolved, as it has been observed both in the
cytosol and in the nucleus depending on the technical approach used. The highest 
SCLY expression and activity in mammals is found in the liver and kidneys.
Disruption of the Scly gene in mice led to obesity, hyperinsulinemia, glucose
intolerance, and hepatic steatosis, with SCLY being suggested as a participant in
the regulation of energy metabolism in a sex-dependent manner. With the
physiological role of SCLY still not fully understood, this review attempts to
discuss the available literature regarding SCLY in animals and provides avenues
for possible future investigation.
