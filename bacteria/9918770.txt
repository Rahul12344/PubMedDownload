c-Src kinases and p21 Ras are known to be implicated in
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated signal transduction. However,
the effects of TCDD on the molecular interaction of adaptor complex in the
protein tyrosine kinase signaling cascade have not been reported. The present
study is designed to clarify whether TCDD modulates the molecular interactions of
Shc, Cbl, Grb2, and Sos in primary rat hepatocytes. TCDD causes an
electrophoretic mobility shift of Sos and increases Sos/Grb2 association.
Tyrosine phosphorylated Shc, mainly p52, unloads to the Grb2/Sos complex upon
TCDD stimulation. Interestingly, TCDD decreases the tyrosine phosphorylation
level of Cbl, although Cbl recruits more Grb2 and Shc proteins by TCDD. These
results indicate that TCDD modulates the molecular interaction of adaptor complex
proteins including Shc, Grb2, Sos, and Cbl. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation
of Cbl may not be critical for interaction of the protein with Grb2 and Shc in
the TCDD signaling pathway in primary rat hepatocytes.
