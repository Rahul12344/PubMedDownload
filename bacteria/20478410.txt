Natural killer (NK) cells are an important component of the host immune defense
against Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). In this study we investigated the effects of 
CT on the expression of two forms of MHC class I-related chain A (MICA). One
form, a truncated variant that has a partial transmembrane region and no
cytoplasmic tail, was expressed in HeLa cells. The other, a full-length variant, 
was expressed in astrocytoma U373 cells. CT infection had little effect on the
expression of the truncated form, which was constitutively expressed in HeLa
cells, but expression of the full-length MICA was down-regulated in CT-infected
U373 cells. Down-regulation of MICA after CT infection protected U373 cells from 
NK cell lysis, whereas HeLa cells expressing the truncated form were killed. This
study shows that the constitutive expression of the truncated from of MICA
prevents CT from evading immune recognition by NK cells.
