Organochlorine contaminants were analysed in surface water from Sundays (SDE) and
Swartkops Estuaries (SWE), Eastern Cape Province, which is among the largest
estuaries in South Africa. The concentration of Σ18OCPs ranged from 16.7 to
249.2 ng/L in autumn, 19.9-81.4 ng/L in winter, 43.6-126.8 ng/L in spring and
68.3-199.9 ng/L in summer for SDE, whereas in SWE, the values varied from 20.9 to
259.7 ng/L in autumn, 58.9-263.9 ng/L in winter, 3.2-183.6 ng/L in spring and
118.0-188.9 ng/L in summer. Among all OCPs, α-HCH, β-HCH, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT,
endrin, dieldrin and endrin aldehyde were predominant in surface water samples
from SDE and SWE. Furthermore, the mean concentration of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) ranged from 126.7 ng/L in winter to 151.0 ng/L in spring for SDE
and 249.0 ng/L in spring to 727.6 ng/L in winter for SWE. Tri- and tetra-PCBs
dominated the PCB homologue profile. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the
study sites into three regions from least polluted to most polluted, indicated
that SWE is more polluted compared to SDE, probably due to the influx of
agricultural and industrial effluents. Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk
assessment revealed that the water from both estuaries is not safe for drinking, 
although suitable for bathing.
