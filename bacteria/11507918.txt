Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by bacteria in niches of the oral
cavity play a major role in the etiology of bad breath, and can be easily
detected by a portable sulfide monitor (Halimeter). To investigate the effect of 
an oral hygiene program on VSC levels, Halimeter readings were taken from 55
healthy dental students during a course in oral hygiene training, including
instruction on brushing, flossing and professional tooth cleaning. Ten students
who received no oral hygiene training served as a negative control. The oral
hygiene status was measured using the papillary bleeding index (PBI). PBI and VSC
values did not show significant changes during the study period of 10 weeks in
the control group. In the test group, PBI values significantly decreased compared
to baseline and the control, indicating that the oral hygiene program had a
benefit on the oral hygiene status. The VSC values also decreased significantly
during the study period compared to baseline and the control. It was concluded
that in a group of dental students, a thorough oral hygiene training program was 
capable of reducing the oral level of VSC Halimeter readings.
