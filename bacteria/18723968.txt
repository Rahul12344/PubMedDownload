Soft tissue neoplasms of breast thought to be derived from Myofibroblasts have
been classified as myofibroblastomas. Myofibroblasts are spindle shaped
mesenchymal cells derived from fibroblasts. These are rare neoplasms (more often 
seen in the male breast) and have same structural and immunohistochemical
characteristics as those of solitary fibrous tumors. We present a case of an
adult female presenting as firm breast lump diagnosed as myofibroblastoma and
confirmed by diffuse positivity of CD34 immunohistochemical stain.
