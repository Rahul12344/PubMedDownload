BACKGROUND: Sinonasal bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) contribute to upper airway
innate immunity and correlate with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) clinical
outcomes. A subset of T2Rs expressed on sinonasal solitary chemosensory cells
(SCCs) are activated by denatonium, resulting in a calcium-mediated secretion of 
bactericidal antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in neighboring ciliated epithelial
cells. We hypothesized that there is patient variability in the amount of
bacterial killing induced by different concentrations of denatonium and that the 
differences correlate with CRS clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Bacterial growth inhibition was quantified after mixing bacteria with
airway surface liquid (ASL) collected from denatonium-stimulated sinonasal
air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Patient ASL bacterial killing at 0.1 mM
denatonium and baseline characteristics and sinus surgery outcomes were compared 
between these populations.
RESULTS: There is variability in the degree of denatonium-induced bacterial
killing between patients. In CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), patients with
increased bacterial killing after stimulation with low levels of denatonium
undergo significantly more functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (FESSs) (p =
0.037) and have worse 6-month post-FESS 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22)
scores (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSION: Bacterial killing after stimulation with low levels of denatonium
correlates with number of prior FESS and postoperative SNOT-22 scores in CRSwNP. 
Some symptoms of CRS in patients with hyperresponsiveness to low levels of
denatonium may be due to increased airway immune activity or inherent disease
severity.
