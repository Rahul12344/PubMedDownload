Effective immunity to infectious agents requires the initial recognition of
antigen by specific receptors, which leads to the activation of immunocytes and
the elicitation of an immune response. Because T cell antigen recognition and
directed responses are complex processes, they are initiated and quelled in a
highly regulated manner. Our laboratory has focused on defining the molecular
processes that control T cell antigen presentation and recognition. Research in
this area is focused on determining the chemical nature of antigens displayed by 
Major histocompatibility, complex (MHC)-encoded class I molecules and the
nonclassical class I-like protein CD1d. Quantitative aspects of antigen
presentation and recognition are also being studied to determine how these
factors control the initiation of a T cell response. Our studies provide insights
into the biochemical basis of T cell antigen recognition and response as well as 
the molecular processes underlying the initiation and regulation of immune
responses by CD1d-restricted natural T lymphocytes.
