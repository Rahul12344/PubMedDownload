BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis develops in 1-5% of individuals bitten by ticks, but
with a diagnostic gap affecting up to 30% of patients, a broadly applicable
pharmacological prevention strategy is needed. Topical azithromycin effectively
eradicated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato from the skin in preclinical studies. 
We assessed its efficacy in human beings.
METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial 
done in 28 study sites in Germany and Austria, adults were equally assigned to
receive topical 10% azithromycin or placebo twice daily for 3 consecutive days,
within 72 h of a tick bite being confirmed. Randomisation numbers, which were
stratified by study site, were accessed in study centres via an interactive
voice-response system, by pharmacists not involved in the study. The primary
outcome was the number of treatment failures, defined as erythema migrans,
seroconversion, or both, in participants who were seronegative at baseline, had
no further tick bites during the study, and had serology results available at 8
weeks (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). This study is registered with
EudraCT, number 2011-000117-39.
FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 1371 participants were randomly 
assigned to treatment, of whom 995 were included in the ITT population. The trial
was stopped early because an improvement in the primary endpoint in the group
receiving azithromycin was not reached. At 8 weeks, 11 (2%) of 505 in the
azithromycin group and 11 (2%) of 490 in the placebo group had treatment failure 
(odds ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·42-2·26, p=0·47). Topical azithromycin was well
tolerated. Similar numbers of patients had adverse events in the two groups (175 
[26%] of 505 vs 177 [26%] of 490, p=0·87), and most adverse events were mild.
INTERPRETATION: Topical azithromycin was well tolerated and had a good safety
profile. Inclusion of asymptomatic seroconversion into the primary efficacy
analysis led to no prevention effect with topical azithromycin. Adequately
powered studies assessing only erythema migrans should be considered. A subgroup 
analysis in this study suggested that topical azithromycin reduces erythema
migrans after bites of infected ticks.
