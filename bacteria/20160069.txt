Cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) is the particulate matter of cigarette smoke.
Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is an opportunistic pathogen involved in
periodontitis. It was hypothesized that the combination of CSC and P. gingivalis 
would increase the collagen-degrading ability of human gingival fibroblasts
(HGFs). In this study, HGFs were exposed to CSC, P. gingivalis supernatant, and
CSC plus P. gingivalis supernatant. The collagen-degrading ability and
protein/mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of 
metalloproteinases (TIMPs) of HGFs were examined. The combined treatment
increased collagen degradation, protein levels of active forms of MMP-1, MMP-2,
MMP-3, and MMP-14 in conditioned media, and the low-molecular-weight fragment of 
MMP-14 in membrane extracts, as well as mRNA levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-14. 
In conclusion, the combined effects of CSC and P. gingivalis increased
HGF-mediated collagen degradation by destroying the balance between MMPs and
TIMPs at multiple levels.
