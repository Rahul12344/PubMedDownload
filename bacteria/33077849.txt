Birdshot retinochoroidopathy occurs exclusively in individuals who are HLA-A29
positive. The mechanism to account for this association is unknown. The gut
microbiome has been causally implicated in many immune-mediated diseases. We
hypothesized that HLA-A29 would affect the composition of the gut microbiome,
leading to a dysbiosis and immune-mediated eye disease. Fecal and intestinal
biopsy samples were obtained from 107 healthy individuals from Portland, Oregon
environs, 10 of whom were HLA-A29 positive, undergoing routine colonoscopy.
Bacterial profiling was achieved via 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Publicly available
whole meta-genome sequencing data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP),
consisting of 298 healthy controls mostly of US origin, were also interrogated.
PERMANOVA and sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLSDA)
demonstrated that subjects who were HLA-A29 positive differed in bacterial
species composition (beta diversity) compared to HLA-A29 negative subjects in
both the Portland (p = 0.019) and HMP cohorts (p = 0.0002). The Portland and HMP 
cohorts evidenced different subsets of bacterial species associated with HLA-A29 
status, likely due to differences in the metagenomic techniques employed. The
functional composition of the HMP cohort did not differ overall (p = 0.14)
between HLA-A29 positive and negative subjects, although some distinct pathways
such as heparan sulfate biosynthesis showed differences. As we and others have
shown for various HLA alleles, the HLA allotype impacts the composition of the
microbiome. We hypothesize that HLA-A29 may predispose chorioretinitis via an
altered gut microbiome.
