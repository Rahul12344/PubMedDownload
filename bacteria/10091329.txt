The upstream flanking region of the ftsQ and ftsZ genes of Brevibacterium flavum 
MJ233, which belongs to the coryneform bacteria, was amplified by the inverse
polymerase chain reaction method and cloned in Escherichia coli. Complementation 
analysis of E. coli mutant with a defective cell-wall synthesis mechanism with
the cloned fragment and its DNA sequencing indicated the presence of the murC
gene, encoding UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase involved in peptidoglycan
synthesis, just upstream from the ftsQ gene. The B. flavum murC gene could encode
a protein of 486 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 51 198
Da. A 50-kDa protein was synthesized by the B. flavum murC gene in an in vitro
transcription/translation system using E. coli S30 lysate. These results indicate
that the genes responsible for cell-wall synthesis and cell division are located 
as a cluster in B. flavum similar to the E. coli mra region.
