Th17 lymphocytes play a key role during immune responses against bacteria and
fungi and are involved in the pathophysiology of multiple autoimmune disorders.
The co-stimulatory molecules SLAMF3 and SLAMF6 have been implicated in the
formation of Th17 phenotypes and IL-17A expression. Increased surface expression 
of SLAMF3 and SLAMF6 has been linked with disease activity in systemic lupus
erythematosus. Here we demonstrate that in human total T lymphocytes the
canonical CD28 and the non-canonical SLAMF3/SLAMF6 co-stimulatory pathways
cooperate in the recruitment of the transcription factor NFAT1 to the IL17A
promoter. Furthermore, the dominance of the SLAMF3/SLAMF6 pathway in inducing
IL-17A production can be attributed to an increased nuclear abundance and
recruitment of RORγt to the IL17A promoter. Thus, we have identified an
additional mechanism that may be central for the specific control of IL17A gene
regulation in systemic lupus erythematosus T lymphocytes.
