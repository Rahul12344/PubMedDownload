We describe the synthesis and purification of two functional peptides, namely
human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and Xenopus laevis magainin II in
Hansenula polymorpha after their synthesis as hybrid proteins fused to the C
terminus of endogenous amine oxidase. The hybrid genes, placed under control of
the H. polymorpha alcohol oxidase promoter (PAOX), were integrated into the
genomic alcohol oxidase locus, yielding stable production strains. High-level
synthesis of the fusion proteins, exceeding 20% of total cellular protein, was
obtained when the transformed strains were grown in methanol-limited chemostat
cultures; when expressed by itself, i.e. in the absence of the amine oxidase
gene, IGF-II could not be recovered from crude cell extracts, probably as a
result of rapid proteolytic degradation. Accumulation in peroxisomes did not
significantly affect the IGF-II protein stability when expressed in the absence
of the carrier protein. Apparently, fusion to the large (+/- 78 kDa) amine
oxidase carrier particularly stabilizes the peptides and prevents them from
proteolysis. After partial purification, the fusion partners were readily
separated by factor Xa treatment.
