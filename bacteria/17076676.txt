PROBLEM: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognition is an important means for the
innate immune system to rapidly respond to pathogen invasion. Our aim was to
determine whether uterine natural killer (uNK) cell cytokine production induced
by stimulation through TLRs could be regulated by endogenous transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-beta in human endometrium.
METHOD OF STUDY: Single cells were isolated from human endometrium, and
interferon (IFN)-gamma production by endometrium cells and uNK cells was
determined after stimulation by TLR agonists. The role of TGF-beta in regulating 
this response was tested by blocking TGF-beta function using antibodies or a
specific inhibitor, SB431542.
RESULTS: TGF-beta blockade increased TLR agonist induced IFN-gamma by uNK cells. 
The regulation of uNK cell cytokine production was observed when uNK cells were
incubated with agonists for TLR2 (PGN) or TLR3 (polyI:C). Blockade of TGF-beta or
TGF-beta receptor signaling had no effect on constitutive cytokine production in 
the absence of TLR agonists.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that endogenous TGF-beta alters cytokine
responses of uNK cells in human endometrium in response to TLR agonists. These
data suggest that uNK cell responses to microbial pathogens in the endometrium
are regulated by the amount of biologically active TGF-beta present within the
human endometrium.
