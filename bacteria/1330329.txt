The bacterial exotoxins staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B (SEA and SEB) mediate 
disease through their effects on T lymphocytes. In this manuscript we have
demonstrated that both SEA and SEB can directly activate purified T cells in the 
absence of accessory cells as determined by a transition from G0 to G1 and
induction of IL-2 receptor expression. However, neither SEA nor SEB alone was
sufficient to result in T-cell proliferation. The induction of T-cell
proliferation by SEB or SEA required the addition of a second costimulatory
signal. This could be provided by either accessory cells or monoclonal antibody
stimulation of CD28. As previously reported, T-cell proliferation induced by
enterotoxin in the presence of accessory cells was partially inhibited by a
blocking antibody against class II MHC. In contrast, in purified T cells when
costimulation was provided through CD28, proliferation was not inhibited by class
II antibody, and HLA-DR expression was not detectable. In addition, costimulation
through CD28 was partially resistant to the effects of cyclosporin A. These
results demonstrate that CD28 costimulation is sufficient to induce proliferation
of enterotoxin-activated T cells, and that this effect is independent of class II
MHC expression.
