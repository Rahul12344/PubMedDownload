Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the influence of a membrane
protein, lactose permease of Escherichia coli (LacY), on the surface spreading
behavior and the features of self-assembled phospholipids bilayers on mica. The
miscibility of phospholipids used, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), was
investigated by surface pressure area isotherm measurements at the air-water
interface. A composition with an equimolar proportion of POPC and DMPC was used
to form the liposomes. Surface layers formed with DMPC:POPC (0.5:0.5, mol/mol) or
LacY reconstituted in proteoliposomes with the same phospholipid composition were
imaged by using AFM. When lactose permease was reconstituted in DMPC:POPC
(0.5:0.5, mol/mol), self-assembled structures that remained firmly adsorbed onto 
the mica surface were observed. These sheets had an irregular shape and their
upper layer was more corrugated than that obtained for the phospholipid matrix.
