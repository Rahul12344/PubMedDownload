Fifteen mice with Pasteurella pneumotropica orbital abscesses were noted in mice 
that were homozygous for a targeted Cd28 gene mutation. Only one mouse
heterozygous for the Cd28 mutation was affected. According to phenotypic
reactions and 16S rDNA sequencing, the isolates were most similar to biotype
Heyl. This article provides evidence for an immunologic basis of susceptibility
to P. pneumotropica infection. Fifteen mice with Pasteurella pneumotropica
