We previously reported evidence that patients with periodontitis have serum
antibodies to oral Gram positive bacteria that are cross-reactive with epithelial
antigens. In the present report cross-reactive epithelial antigens including
CD24, lactate dehydrogenase A [LDM-A], antioxidant protein 2 [AOP 2] and nuclear 
factor of activated T cells 5 [NFAT 5], were identified by screening a cDNA
expression library with pooled patient sera. Titres of antibodies to CD24 peptide
correlated negatively with indices of periodontal disease severity. Strong
expression of CD24 in the reactive periodontal epithelium and inflamed gingival
attachment contrasted with low to undetectable expression in the external
gingival epithelium. In periodontitis, a local action of these auto-reactive
antibodies could modulate the regulatory potential associated with expression of 
CD24 in this epithelium.
