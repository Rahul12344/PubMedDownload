The first isolation of Tenacibaculum maritimum from wedge sole, Dicologoglossa
cuneata, is reported. The pathogen was recovered from ulcers of cultured fish,
from three different outbreaks. The six isolates obtained were biochemically and 
serologically characterized and diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction using specific primers and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The
isolates constituted a homogeneous phenotypic group; however, they belong to two 
of the different serotypes described within this species. A virulence evaluation 
of the isolates using Wedge sole fry was also performed.
