Adaptive immunity requires that T cells efficiently scan diverse cell surfaces to
identify cognate Ag. However, the basic cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In
this study, we investigated this process using vascular endothelial cells, APCs
that possess a unique and extremely advantageous, planar morphology.
High-resolution imaging revealed that CD4 memory/effector T cells dynamically
probe the endothelium by extending submicron-scale, actin-rich
"invadosome/podosome-like protrusions" (ILPs). The intimate intercellular
contacts enforced by ILPs consistently preceded and supported T cell activation
in response to endothelial MHC class II/Ag. The resulting calcium flux stabilized
dense arrays of ILPs (each enriched in TCR, protein kinase C-Î¸, ZAP70,
phosphotyrosine, and HS1), forming what we term a podo-synapse. Similar findings 
were made using CD8 CTLs on endothelium. Furthermore, careful re-examination of
both traditional APC models and professional APCs suggests broad relevance for
ILPs in facilitating Ag recognition. Together, our results indicate that ILPs
function as sensory organelles that serve as actuators of immune surveillance.
