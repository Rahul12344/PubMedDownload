MHC class II-expressing double-positive thymocytes induce progression of CD4(+) T
cell development as efficiently as cortical thymic epithelial cells do. Because
double-positive thymocytes expressing CD1d select natural killer T (NKT) cells,
we investigated whether thymocyte-selected CD4(+) (T-CD4) T cells require the
same signaling components as NKT cells. Using bone-marrow chimeras, we found that
the signaling molecules SAP, Fyn, and PKCtheta were essential for T-CD4 T cell
generation, whereas mutations in the Ly108 receptor, interleukin-15 receptor
alpha, or the transcription factor T-bet had a marginal effect. Furthermore, SAP 
was critical for IL-4 production by T-CD4 T cells, but the PKCtheta deficiency
did not alter the ability of T-CD4 T cells to produce cytokines. T-bet was
necessary to produce the maximum amount of IFN-gamma for CD4(+) T cells
regardless of the selection pathway. Thus, in contrast to epithelial
cell-selected CD4(+) T cells, the two distinct lineages of T cells selected by
thymocytes--i.e., T-CD4 and NKT cells--both utilize the SAP-Fyn-PKCtheta pathway 
for their development and function.
