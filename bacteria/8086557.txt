An AIDS patient with the recalcitrant erythematous desquamating (RED) disorder, a
presumed variant of the Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome that is
characterized by relapses, skin involvement, and variable multiple-organ
involvement, is described. A strain of S. aureus producing toxic shock syndrome
toxin 1 was isolated from the patient, but no antibodies to this exotoxin were
detectable before and during the most severe episode of the RED disorder. Levels 
of cytokines were measured during episodes and at other times. Tumor necrosis
factor and interleukin 6 were detectable only during the most severe exacerbation
of the disorder; this finding suggests a pathogenetic role for these cytokines.
