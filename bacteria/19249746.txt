OBJECTIVES: Candida albicans cells form biofilms on polymeric surfaces of
dentures and other prostheses introduced into the oral cavity. Many biofilm
microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobial agents; C. albicans cells may 
also develop resistance to naturally occurring antifungal peptides in human
saliva including histatins (Hsts) and defensins (hBDs). Therefore, we evaluated
Hst 5 activity on C. albicans biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells and
measured whether surface treatment of denture acrylic with Hst 5, hBD-3, or
chlorhexidine gluconate could inhibit in vitro biofilm development.
METHODS: Acrylic disks were preconditioned with 500 microl saliva for 30 min, and
inoculated with C. albicans cells (10(6)cells/ml) for 1h, at 37 degrees C.
Non-adherent cells were removed by washing and disks and were incubated in YPD
growth medium for 24, 48, and 72 h at 37 degrees C. Candidacidal assays were
performed on 48-h-biofilms and on planktonically grown cells using Hst 5 (15.5,
31.25, and 62 microM). Cell adhesion was compared on disks pre-coated with 0.12% 
chlorhexidine gluconate, 50 microM Hst 5, or 0.6 microM hBD-3 after 24, 48, and
72 h growth.
RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in sensitivity to Hst 5 of
biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells (p>0.05). Pre-coating disks with hBD-3
did not inhibit biofilm development; however, Hst 5 significantly inhibited
biofilm development at 72 h, while 0.12% chlorhexidine significantly inhibited
biofilm development at all time intervals (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans biofilm cells grown on denture acrylic are sensitive to 
killing by Hst 5. Surface coating acrylic with chlorhexidine or Hst 5 effectively
inhibits biofilm growth and has potential therapeutic application.
