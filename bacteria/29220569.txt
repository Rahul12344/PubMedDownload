Analysis of the genome sequence of the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5 
revealed the presence of numerous cryptic megasynthetase gene clusters, one of
which we here assign to two previously unknown chlorinated metabolites by a
comparative gene inactivation and secondary metabolomics approach. Structure
elucidation of these compounds revealed a unique cyclic depsipeptide skeleton
featuring β- and δ-amide bonds of aspartic acid and 3-methyl ornithine moieties, 
respectively. Insights into their biosynthesis were obtained by targeted gene
inactivation and feeding experiments employing isotope-labeled precursors. The
compounds were produced ubiquitously by the species Chondromyces crocatus and
were found to inhibit the carbon storage regulator-RNA interaction.
