Efficient and effective therapies are required for diabetes mellitus. The use of 
adult stem cells for treating diabetes represents a major focus of current
research. We have attempted to differentiate adult stem cells produced from
umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells into insulin-producing cells (IPCs).
By activating the c-Met/HGF axis through temporal hypoxia treatment and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) supplementation, our protocol resulted in the
differentiation of cells into functional pancreatic endocrine cells with
increased viability. Glucose stimulation test results showed that significantly
greater amounts of C-peptide and insulin were released from the differentiated
cells than from undifferentiated cells. These IPCs were capable of reversing the 
hyperglycemia of diabetic mice. In conclusion, targeting the c-Met/HGF axis can
be considered an effective and efficient means of obtaining IPCs from adult stem 
cells.
