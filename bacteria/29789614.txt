The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle is presumably evolved for optimal synthesis
of C3 sugars, but not for the production of C2 metabolite acetyl-CoA. The carbon 
loss in producing acetyl-CoA from decarboxylation of C3 sugar limits the maximum 
carbon yield of photosynthesis. Here we design a synthetic malyl-CoA-glycerate
(MCG) pathway to augment the CBB cycle for efficient acetyl-CoA synthesis. This
pathway converts a C3 metabolite to two acetyl-CoA by fixation of one additional 
CO2 equivalent, or assimilates glyoxylate, a photorespiration intermediate, to
produce acetyl-CoA without net carbon loss. We first functionally demonstrate the
design of the MCG pathway in vitro and in Escherichia coli. We then implement the
pathway in a photosynthetic organism Synechococcus elongates PCC7942, and show
that it increases the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool and enhances bicarbonate
assimilation by roughly 2-fold. This work provides a strategy to improve carbon
fixation efficiency in photosynthetic organisms.
