Expression of CD11b is enhanced on neutrophils recruited to the lungs during
bacterial pneumonia. To determine the role that CD11b plays in pneumonia, CD11b
gene-deficient (CD11b(-/-)) mice and normal wild-type (wt) mice were intranasally
infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. CD11b(-/-) mice had an enhanced outgrowth
of pneumococci in the lungs and an increased dissemination of the infection,
which could be reproduced by treatment of wt mice with an anti-CD11b antibody.
This reduced resistance was associated with higher neutrophil counts in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue and an exaggerated lung inflammatory
response. CD11b is important for an effective defense against S. pneumoniae
pneumonia but not for recruitment of neutrophils.
