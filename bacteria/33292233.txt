BACKGROUND: Pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is connected to deregulation 
of apoptosis while the effect of lncRNAs, as critical regulatory molecules, on
this pathway is not clear well. The present study aimed to identify differential 
expression of genes and their related lncRNAs which are significantly associated 
with intrinsic apoptotic pathway in CRC.
METHODS: The connection between CRC and apoptosis was investigated by literature 
reviews and the genes were enriched by using Enrichr. At the next step,
differential expression of enriched genes were evaluated between normal and tumor
populations in data sets and were downloaded from GEO. Then, meta-analysis and
probe re-annotation were performed. For lncRNAs selection through the highest
expression correlation with each of candidate genes, mRNA-lncRNA interaction of
screened genes and all of lncRNAs were visualized using Cytoscape. Identified
differential expression genes and lncRNAs were validated using TCGA-COAD and the 
obtained data were confirmed by in vitro studies in the presence of Ag@Glu-TSC
nanoparticle as an apoptotic inducer. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction effect
of Ag@Glu-TSC on Caco-2 cells was determined via MTT and Annexin V/PI,
respectively. The expression of genes and lncRNAs were assayed in presence of
mentioned nanoparticle. Finally, the expression level of desired genes and
lncRNAs were proven in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues.
RESULTS: After detection of 48 genes associated with intrinsic apoptosis in CRC
according to literature, Enrichr screened 12 common genes involved in this
pathway. Among them, 6 genes including BCL2, BCL2L11, BAD, CASP7, CASP9, and CYCS
expression reduced in tumor tissue compared to normal according to meta-analysis 
studies and RNA-seq TCGA data. Afterwards, association of 8 lncRNAs comprising
CDKN2B-AS1, LOC102724156, HAGLR, ABCC13, LOC101929340, LINC00675, FAM120AOS,
PDCD4-AS1 with more than 5 candidate genes were identified. In vitro studies
revealed that four selected lncRNAs including, CDKN2B-AS1, LOC102724156, HAGLR
and FAM120AOS were significantly increased in the presence of in optimum
concentration of Ag@Glu/TSC and decreased in tumor tissues versus adjacent normal
tissues.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a new data mining method to screen
differentially expressed lncRNAs which are involved in regulation of intrinsic
apoptosis pathway in CRC quickly using published gene expression profiling
microarrays. Moreover, we could validate a number of these regulators in the
cellular and laboratory disease models.
