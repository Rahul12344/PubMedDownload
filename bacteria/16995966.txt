Angiosarcomas rarely arise from schwannomas, but we describe here a case of
angiosarcoma that arose from a remnant of a benign vestibular schwannoma that had
been removed 10 years earlier. The patient was a 66-year-old man with no sign of 
neurofibromatosis. Although we attempted surgical resection, we could not totally
remove the tumour. The patient died nine months after diagnosis, primarily as
result of an abscess in the cerebellum and base of the skull. The histological
diagnosis was confirmed by the immunohistochemical findings of positivity for
CD34 antigen and S-100 protein in the resected tumour.A review of the literature 
revealed four other cases of angiosarcoma with schwannoma, all of which arose
from an extracranial nerve. The present case is the first report of an
angiosarcoma with schwannoma arising from an intracranial locus.
