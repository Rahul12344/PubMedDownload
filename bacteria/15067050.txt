Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catabolizes heme into CO, biliverdin, and free iron and
serves as a protective enzyme by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, 
and antiproliferative actions. Previously, we have demonstrated that human CD4(+)
T cells express HO-1 and that HO-1-overexpressing Jurkat T cells tend to display 
lower proliferative response. The aim of this study is to elucidate the
mechanism(s) by which HO-1 can mediate its antiproliferative effect on CD4(+) T
cells. Among the three HO-1 byproducts, only CO showed suppressive effect on T
cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 Abs, mimicking the
antiproliferative action of HO-1. CO blocked the cell cycle entry of T cells,
which was independent of the guanylate cyclase/cGMP pathway. CO also suppressed
the secretion of IL-2, and this suppressive effect of CO on IL-2 secretion
mediated the antiproliferative action of CO. CO selectively inhibited the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, which could explain the
suppressive effects of CO on T cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion. Based on
these findings, we suggest that HO-1/CO suppresses T cell proliferation and IL-2 
secretion, possibly via its inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
activation.
