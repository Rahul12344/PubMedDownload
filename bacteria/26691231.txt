On 12 June 2015, Corynebacterium diphtheriae was identified in a skin swab from a
burns patient in Scotland. The isolate was confirmed to be genotypically and
phenotypically toxigenic. Multilocus sequence typing of three patient isolates
yielded sequence type ST 125. The patient was clinically well. We summarise
findings of this case, and results of close contact identification and screening:
12 family and close contacts and 32 hospital staff have been found negative for
C. diphtheriae.
