Chlorhexidine (CHX), one of the most effective drugs administered for periodontal
treatment, presents collateral effects including toxicity when used for prolonged
periods; here, we have evaluated the bactericidal potency and the
cytocompatibility of Juniperus excelsa M. Bieb essential oil (EO) in comparison
with 0.05% CHX. The EO was extracted from berries by hydrodistillation and
components identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Bacterial
inhibition halo analysis, quantitative cell viability
2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-5-[(phenyl amino)
carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay (XTT), and colony forming unit (CFU)
count were evaluated against the two biofilm formers Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, cytocompatibility was
assessed with human primary gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and mucosal keratinocytes 
(HK). The resulting EO was mainly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons and
oxygenated monoterpenes. An inhibition halo test demonstrated that both bacteria 
were sensitive to the EO; XTT analysis and CFU counts confirmed that
10-fold-diluted EO determined a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in
bacteria count and viability towards both biofilm and planktonic forms in a
comparable manner to those obtained with CHX. Moreover, EO displayed higher
cytocompatibility than CHX (p < 0.05). In conclusion, EO exhibited bactericidal
activity similar to CHX, but a superior cytocompatibility, making it a promising 
antiseptic alternative to CHX.
