INTRODUCTION: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) tend to be immunosuppressed
due to RA itself and the therapeutic drugs administered. The management of
surgical site infection (SSI) following upper cervical spinal instrumented fusion
in RA patients is challenging; however, literature on the treatment for such
conditions is scarce. We report 3 consecutive patients with RA, who developed
deep SSI following upper cervical posterior fusion and were treated using
antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC).
PATIENT CONCERNS: All 3 patients reported in the current study experienced
compression myelopathy with upper cervical spinal deformity and received
prednisolone and methotrexate for controlling RA preoperatively. The patient in
Case 1 underwent C1-2 posterior fusion and developed deep SSI due to
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus at 3 months postoperatively; the
patient in Case 2 underwent occipito-C2 posterior fusion and developed deep SSI
due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus at 2 weeks postoperatively;
and the patient in Case 3 underwent occipito-C2 posterior instrumented fusion and
laminoplasty at C3-7, and developed deep SSI due to methicillin-resistant
coagulase negative staphylococci at 3 weeks postoperatively.
DIAGNOSIS: All patients developed deep staphylococcal SSI in the postoperative
period.
INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients were treated using ALBC placed on and around the
instrumentation to cover them and occupy the dead space after radical open
debridement.
OUTCOMES: The deep infection was resolved uneventfully after the single surgical 
intervention retaining spinal instrumentation. Good clinical outcomes of the
initial surgery were maintained until the final follow-up without recurrence of
SSI in all 3 cases.
CONCLUSION: ALBC embedding spinal instrumentation procedure can be a viable
treatment for curing SSI in complex cases, such as patients with RA who undergo
high cervical fusion surgeries without implant removal.
