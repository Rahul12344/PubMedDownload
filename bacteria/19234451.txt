Here we describe an approach to investigate di- or oligomerization of
transmembrane receptors in living cells with fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP). We immobilized a defined fraction of receptors with
antibodies and then measured lateral mobility of the nonimmobilized fraction by
FRAP. We validated this approach with CD86 and CD28 as monomeric and dimeric
reference proteins, respectively. Di- or oligomerization of G protein-coupled
receptors is strongly debated. We studied human beta-adrenergic receptors as
prototypical G protein-coupled receptors and found that beta(1)-AR shows
transient interactions whereas beta(2)-AR can form stable oligomers. We propose
that this FRAP method can be widely applied to study di- or oligomerization of
cell-surface proteins.
