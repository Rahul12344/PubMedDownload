Orthopaedic surgery comes with an inherent risk of bacterial infection, prolonged
antibiotic therapy and revision surgery. Recent research has focused on
nanostructured surfaces to improve the bactericidal and osseointegrational
properties of implants. However, an understanding of the mechanical properties of
bactericidal materials is lacking. In this work, the surface properties of
hydrothermal TiO₂ nanostructured surfaces are investigated for their effect on
bactericidal efficiency and cellular metabolic activity of human osteoblast
cells. TiO₂ nanostructures, approximately 307 nm in height and 14 GPa stiffness, 
were the most effective structures against both gram-positive (Staphylococcus
aureus) and gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. Statistical analysis
significantly correlated structure height to the death of both bacteria strains. 
In addition, the surface contact angle and Young's modulus were correlated to
osteoblast metabolic activity. Hydrophilic surfaces with a contact angle between 
35 and 50° produced the highest cellular metabolic activity rates after 24 hours 
of incubation. The mechanical tests showed that nanostructures retain their
mechanical stability and integrity over a long time-period, reaffirming the
surfaces' applicability for implants. This work provides a thorough examination
of the surface, mechanical and wettability properties of multifunctional
hydrothermally synthesised nanostructured materials, capable of killing bacteria 
whilst improving osteoblast metabolic rates, leading to improved osseointegration
and antibacterial properties of orthopaedic implants.
