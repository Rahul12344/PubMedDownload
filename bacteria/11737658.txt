To investigate the genetic predisposition toward the accumulation of oral
microorganisms, the association between the alleles of HLA-DQA1, -DQB1 and -DRB1 
and the salivary numbers of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were examined in
102 young adults in Japan. HLA-DQA1*0102, DQB1*0604, DRB1*0802, and DRB1*1302
were weakly associated with the numbers of lactobacilli in saliva samples
(P<0.05). HLA-DQB1*0601 was associated with the salivary numbers of mutans
streptococci (P<0.01). Two HLA class II haplotypes,
HLA-[DRB1*0802-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302] and HLA-[DRB1*1302-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0604], were
also weakly associated with the salivary numbers of lactobacilli (P<0.05). These 
observations suggest that HLA class II alleles may be related to the salivary
populations of oral microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
