The effects of MUC1 DNA vaccination on the orthotopic growth and liver metastasis
of colon carcinoma cells were investigated in mice. Vaccination with MUC1 DNA
resulted in immune responses that were effective in suppressing mouse colon
carcinoma cells transfected with MUC1 cDNA. CD4+ T cells but not CD8+ T cells
mediated this antitumor response as shown by the in vivo depletion of lymphocyte 
subpopulations with the use of anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibody. The effects of
neutralizing antibodies in vivo revealed that the predominant effector molecule
in preventing orthotopic tumor growth was FasL, whereas the effector molecule
effective in preventing liver metastasis was tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Colon
carcinoma cells isolated from tumors growing in the ceca, spleens, and livers
were shown to be equally sensitive to FasL and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The
results strongly suggest that elimination of tumor cells initiated by DNA
vaccination in the present protocol is mediated by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells 
and the effector mechanisms in the cecum and in the liver are distinct due to a
unique organ microenvironment.
