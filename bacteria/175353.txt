Specific spin-labeling of transfer ribonucleic acid molecules.

Caron M, Dugas H.

The spin labels anhydride (ASL), bromoacetamide (BSL) and carbodiimide (CSL) were
used to label selectively tRNAGlu, tRNA fMet and tRNAPhe from E. coli. The
preparation and characterization of the sites of labeling of eight new
spin-labeled tRNAs are described. The sites of labeling are: s2U using ASL, BSL
and CLS and tRNAGlu; s4U using ASL and BSL on tRNAfMet and tRNAPhe; U-37 with CSL
on tRNfMet; U-33 with CSL on tRNAPhe. The rare base X at position 47 of tRNAPhe
has been acylated with a spin-labeled N-hydroxysuccinimide (HSL). The 3'end of
unfractionated tRNA molecules has been chemically modified to a morpholino
spin-labeled analogue (MSL). Their respective e.s.r. spectra are reported and
discussed.
