The ftsZ gene was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of Brevibacterium
lactofermentum by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two oligonucleotides 
designed from two conserved regions found in most of the previously cloned and
sequenced ftsZ genes from other microorganisms. ftsZ is a single-copy gene in
corynebacteria and is located downstream from ftsQ and murC, indicating linkage
between genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis (mur genes) and genes involved 
in cell division (fts genes). The organisation of the cluster is similar to that 
in Streptomyces and different from those of Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis
because ftsA is not located upstream of ftsZ. The gene was expressed in E. coli
using the T7 expression system; the calculated molecular weight of the expressed 
protein was 50 kDa. Expression of the B. lactofermentum ftsZ gene in E. coli
inhibited cell division and led to filamentation. The ftsZ gene of this organism 
does not complement ftsZ mutations or deletions in E. coli, when cloned on low or
high-copy-number vectors.
