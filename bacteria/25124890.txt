OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the change in gene
expression between two time points following stroke and to identify biomarkers of
stroke recovery through gene expression profiling and pathway analysis.
METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 34 ischemic stroke patients
(confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging) ≥18 years of age, within 24 hr of
symptom onset and 24-48 hr later, and from healthy controls. The Modified Rankin 
Scale (MRS) was used to determine 30-day recovery. Total RNA was extracted from
whole blood in Paxgene RNA tubes, amplified, and hybridized to Illumina
HumanRef-8v2 bead chips. Gene expression was compared in a univariate manner
between stroke patients at both time points and good versus bad outcome using
t-test in GeneSpring. Inflation of Type 1 error was corrected by false discovery 
rate (FDR), and Ingenuity Systems Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed. A
secondary validation cohort was recruited from a local hospital.
RESULTS: Three genes were significantly downregulated over time (LY96, IL8, and
SDPR; FDR corrected p < .05). This finding was confirmed in a validation cohort
of stroke patients (n = 8). IPA revealed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)
signaling was the most significant pathway present in the peripheral whole blood 
of stroke patients 24-48 hr after onset. When controlling for age and National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, high baseline expression of TLR2 and
TLR4 significantly predicted worse scores on the MRS.
CONCLUSION: CTLA4 signaling is a novel pathway for the study of stroke-induced
immune suppression. Markers of immune dysfunction early after stroke may prove
useful for identifying patients with increased risk of poor recovery.
