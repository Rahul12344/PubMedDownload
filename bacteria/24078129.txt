Impact of heparin-binding domain of recombinant human
osteocalcin-fibronectinIII9-14 on the osteoblastic cell response.

Yun YR, Kim HW, Jang JH.

Fibronectin (FN) containing a heparin-binding domain (HBD) and an Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) domain can promote cell adhesion and proliferation compared to FN that
contained only RGD. Here, we have engineered recombinant human osteocalcin (rhOC)
with FN type III9-14 (rhOC-FNIII9-14) containing RGD and HBD to promote the
cellular activity of MC3T3-E1 cells, including adhesion, proliferation, and
differentiation. RhOC-FNIII9-14 significantly increased cell adhesion and
proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells compared to rhOC-FNIII9-10 (P < 0.05). Moreover, 
rhOC-FNIII9-14 showed osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells in
mineralization activity and osteogenic gene expression.
