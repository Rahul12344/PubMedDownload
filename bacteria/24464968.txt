BACKGROUND: The upper (UAW) and lower (LAW) airways of patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF) have the same ion-channel defects, but little is known about
similarities and differences in host immunological responses at the two levels.
AIM: Identification and comparison of both levels' pathogen colonization and
resulting immunological host responses.
METHODS: The UAW and LAW of 40 CF patients were non-invasively assessed by nasal 
lavage and induced sputum. Pathogen colonization, cytology, and the
concentrations of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, MPO, matrix metalloprotease
(MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1, regulated upon activation,
normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), and interleukin
(IL)-1β, -5, -6, -8, and -10) were measured.
RESULTS: Inflammatory responses were more pronounced in the LAW than the UAW.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa LAW colonization is accompanied by a significantly
enhanced neutrophil (PMN)-dominated response (P = 0.041) and IL-8 concentration
(P = 0.01) not observed in P. aeruginosa UAW colonization. In contrast, sinonasal
P. aeruginosa colonization resulted in elevated RANTES (P = 0.039) and reduced
MMP-9 (P = 0.023) and TIMP-1 (P = 0.035) concentrations. Interestingly, LAW P.
aeruginosa colonization was associated with reduced sinonasal concentrations of
MMP-9 (P = 0.01) and TIMP-1 (P = 0.02), a finding independent of UAW colonization
for MMP-9.
CONCLUSION: CF UAW and LAW show distinct inflammatory profiles and differentiated
responses upon P. aeruginosa colonization. Assessment of UAW colonization and
MMP-9 are predictive of chronic pulmonary colonization with P. aeruginosa. Thus, 
this linkage between CF UAW and LAW can provide new clinical and scientific
implications.
