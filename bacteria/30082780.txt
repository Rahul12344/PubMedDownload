Considering the significance of mast cells (MCs) in the course of various
physiological and pathological processes, and the pivotal role of endogenous
molecules, i.e., cathelicidins and defensins as multifunctional modulators, the
study examines the constitutive and cathelicidin LL-37/defensin hBD-2-induced
expression of certain NLRs and RLRs, i.e., NOD1, NOD2, and RIG-I, in fully-mature
tissue MCs, and the impact of LL-37 and hBD-2 on MC pro-inflammatory activity.
All experiments were carried out in vitro on freshly-isolated peritoneal (P)MCs. 
qRT-PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy were used to
evaluate both constitutive and LL-37/hBD-2-induced expression of NOD1, NOD2, and 
RIG-I receptors. ROS was determined using H2DCFDA, and Boyden microchamber assay 
was used to define the migratory response. Standard techniques assessed
histamine, cysLT, and chemokine generation. PMCs express NOD1, NOD2, and RIG-I
constitutively. LL-37 and hBD-2 enhance the expression and induce translocation
of the studied receptors and directly activate the pro-inflammatory and migratory
responses of PMCs. Observations demonstrate that LL-37 and hBD-2 might augment MC
capability and sensitivity to NLR and RLR ligands and strengthen the role of MCs 
in inflammation.
