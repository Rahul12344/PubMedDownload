OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori endangers the
successful eradication of the bacteria. The aim of this prospective surveillance 
study (ResiNet) is to continuously keep antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori in 
Germany under surveillance and to identify risk factors for its development.
METHODS: From July 2001 until December 2012, we tested the antimicrobial
susceptibility of H. pylori strains isolated from 1651 prospectively enrolled
patients. We analysed clinical and epidemiological data and identified risk
factors for the development of resistance.
RESULTS: Average primary resistances were 29.4% for metronidazole, 6.7% for
clarithromycin and 3.1% for both antimicrobials. Prior unsuccessful eradication
treatments, female sex and country or continent of origin were identified as
independent risk factors for development of resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori-positive patients without prior eradication therapy can be
treated empirically; antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended in
previously unsuccessfully treated patients and in patients who have received
antimicrobial chemotherapies due to unrelated bacterial infections.
