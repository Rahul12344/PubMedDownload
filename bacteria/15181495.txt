Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disease
characterized by markedly high titers of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), chronic
eczema, recurrent staphylococcal infections, pneumatoceles, reduced neutrophil
chemotaxis, and variable impaired T cell function. There are no clinical tools
for diagnosis and definitive laboratory investigation. Variability of
presentation makes it easy to confuse the diagnosis with that of severe atopy or 
other rare immunodeficiencies. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy with
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome with recurrent methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus furunculosis. Physical examination revealed a peculiar
facial appearance, pruritic dermatitis, and furunculosis over the scalp, neck,
and back. Laboratory investigation revealed mild leukocytosis with eosinophilia, 
a very high immunoglobulin E level, defective neutrophil chemotaxis, and impaired
lymphocyte proliferation to anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies. The boy was
discharged without incident after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy and debridement.
