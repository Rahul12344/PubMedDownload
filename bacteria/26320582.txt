Early endosomes represent the first sorting station for vesicular ubiquitylated
cargo. Tollip, through its C2 domain, associates with endosomal
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) and binds ubiquitylated cargo in
these compartments via its C2 and CUE domains. Tom1, through its GAT domain, is
recruited to endosomes by binding to the Tollip Tom1-binding domain (TBD) through
an unknown mechanism. Nuclear magnetic resonance data revealed that Tollip TBD is
a natively unfolded domain that partially folds at its N terminus when bound to
Tom1 GAT through high-affinity hydrophobic contacts. Furthermore, this
association abrogates binding of Tollip to PtdIns(3)P by additionally targeting
its C2 domain. Tom1 GAT is also able to bind ubiquitin and PtdIns(3)P at
overlapping sites, albeit with modest affinity. We propose that association with 
Tom1 favors the release of Tollip from endosomal membranes, allowing Tollip to
commit to cargo trafficking.
