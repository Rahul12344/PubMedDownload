BACKGROUND: Sequential therapy is currently suggested as first-line therapy in
curing Helicobacter pylori infection, but results coming from its use in clinical
practice are scarce. We evaluated the efficacy of this therapy regimen in our
current clinical practice.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 437 consecutive dyspeptic
patients with proven H. pylori infection. Patients received a 10-day sequential
therapy with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus amoxicillin 1 g for the first 5
days, followed by PPI, clarithromycin 500 mg, and tinidazole 500 mg for the
remaining 5 days (all twice daily) plus PPI every day for further 4 weeks in case
of active peptic ulcer or severe gastritis detected at endoscopy. One month after
conclusion of therapy, endoscopy was performed in those patients for whom the
examinations were clinically relevant. The remaining patients were checked by
C-urea breath test.
RESULTS: Three-hundred ninety-eight patients (91.08%; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 87.91%-93.50%) were fully compliant, 19 patients (4.35%; 95% CI,
2.71%-6.83%) took less than 80% of the prescribed drugs, 11 patients (2.52%; 95% 
CI, 1.33%-4.60%) were withdrawn because of side effects, and 9 patients (2.06%;
95% CI, 1.01%-4.01%) were lost to follow-up. The H. pylori eradication was
obtained in 395 (90.39%, 95% C.I. 87.14% to 92.91%) of 437 and in 362 of 437
(82.84%, 95% C.I. 78.90% to 86.19%) as per-protocol and intention-to-treat
analyses, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequential regimen seems to be a valid therapeutic strategy for the 
management of H. pylori infection in clinical practice.
