Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a small population of pluripotent cells residing
within heterogeneous tumor mass, remain highly resistant to various
chemotherapies as compared to the differentiated cancer cells. It is being
postulated that CSCs possess unique molecular mechanisms, such as autophagic
homeostasis, that allow CSCs to withstand the therapeutic assaults. Here we
demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition differentially modulates
macroautophagy/autophagy in CSCs as compared to that of differentiated cancer
cells. Using human and murine CSC models and differentiated cells, we show that
the inhibition or knockdown (KD) of HDAC6 decreases CSC pluripotency by
downregulating major pluripotency factors POU5F1, NANOG and SOX2. This decreased 
HDAC6 expression increases ACTB, TUBB3 and CSN2 expression and promotes
differentiation in CSCs in an apoptosis-independent manner. Mechanistically,
HDAC6 KD in CSCs decreases pluripotency by promoting autophagy, whereas the
inhibition of pluripotency via retinoic acid treatment, POU5F1 or
autophagy-related gene (ATG7 and ATG12) KD in CSCs decreases HDAC6 expression and
promotes differentiation. Interestingly, HDAC6 KD-mediated CSC growth inhibition 
is further enhanced in the presence of autophagy inducers Tat-Beclin 1 peptide
and rapamycin. In contrast to the results observed in CSCs, HDAC6 KD in
differentiated breast cancer cells downregulates autophagy and increases
apoptosis. Furthermore, the autophagy regulator p-MTOR, upstream negative
regulators of p-MTOR (TSC1 and TSC2) and downstream effectors of p-MTOR (p-RPS6KB
and p-EIF4EBP1) are differentially regulated in CSCs versus differentiated cancer
cells following HDAC6 KD. Overall these data identify the differential regulation
of autophagy as a molecular link behind the differing chemo-susceptibility of
CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.
