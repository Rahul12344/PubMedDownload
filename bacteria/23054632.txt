Lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that is encountered in an
extensive range of foods such as fermented dairy products, meat, vegetables, and 
bakery products. Given the little molecular information available on the
lipolytic activity of L. plantarum, the aim of this study was to clone, purify,
and biochemically characterize the esterase coded by gene lp_0796 (Est0796). The 
esterase was cloned in pET28a and purified in two steps, using solid ammonium
sulfate and His tag affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified
Est0796 was 28.7 kDa (by SDS-PAGE) and 26.6 kDa (by gel filtration
chromatography), pointing to a monomeric structure. Est0796 showed maximum
activity at pH 8.0 and 35 °C and toward shorter acyl chain lengths (C2-C4). The
activity was resistant to organic solvents and cations, suggesting that this
esterase may play a role in the fermentation of food products.
