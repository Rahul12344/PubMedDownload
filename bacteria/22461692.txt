Naturally arising CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (nTregs) have an
essential role in maintenance of immune homeostasis and peripheral tolerance.
Previously, we reported that conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells undergo
p53-induced CD28-dependent apoptosis (PICA) when stimulated with a combination of
immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs, whereas nTregs expand robustly under the 
same conditions, suggesting that there is a differential survival mechanism
against PICA between conventional T cells and nTregs. In this study, we
demonstrate that TGF-β signaling is required for nTregs to survive PICA.
Conversely, when an active form of exogenous TGF-β is present, conventional T
cells become resistant to PICA and undergo robust expansion instead of apoptosis,
with reduction of the proapoptotic protein Bim and FoxO3a. A substantial fraction
of PICA-resistant T cells expressed IL-9 (T(H)9 cells). Moreover, the presence of
IL-6 along with TGF-β led to the generation of T(H)17 cells from conventional T
cells. Together, the data demonstrate a novel role for TGF-β in the homeostasis
of regulatory T cells and effector T cell differentiation and expansion.
