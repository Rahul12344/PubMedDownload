Interleukin 17A-producing T helper cells (Th17) are CD4+ T cells that are crucial
to immunity to extracellular bacteria. The roles of these cells in the bovine
species are poorly defined, because the characterization of bovine Th17 cells
lags behind for want of straightforward cultivation and isolation procedures. We 
have developed procedures to differentiate, expand, and isolate bovine Th17 cells
from circulating CD4+ T cells of adult cows. Using polyclonal stimulation with
antibodies to CD3 and CD28, we expanded IL-17A-positive CD4+ T cells in a
serum-free cell culture medium supplemented with TGF-β1, IL-6 and IL-2.
Populations of CD4+ T cells producing IL-17A or IFN-γ or both cytokines were
obtained. Isolation of IL-17A-secreting CD4+ T cells was performed by labelling
surface IL-17A, followed by flow cytometry cell sorting. The sorted Th17 cells
were restimulated and could be expanded for several weeks. These cells were
further characterized by cytokine profiling at transcriptomic and protein levels.
They produced high amounts of IL-17A and IL-17F, and moderate amounts of IL-22
and IFN-γ. The techniques developed will be useful to characterize the phenotypic
and functional properties of bovine Th17 cells.
