The functional screening of a Pseudacanthotermes militaris termite gut
metagenomic library revealed an array of xylan-degrading enzymes, including P.
militaris 25 (Pm25), a multimodular glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10).
Sequence analysis showed details of the unusual domain organization of this
enzyme. It consists of one catalytic domain, which is intercalated by two
carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) from family 4. The genes upstream of the
genes encoding Pm25 are susC-susD-unk, suggesting Pm25 is a Xyn10C-like enzyme
belonging to a polysaccharide utilization locus. The majority of Xyn10C-like
enzymes shared the same interrupted domain architecture and were vastly
distributed in different xylan utilization loci found in gut Bacteroidetes,
indicating the importance of this enzyme in glycan acquisition for gut
microbiota. To understand its unusual multimodularity and the possible role of
the CBMs, a detailed characterization of the full-length Pm25 and truncated
variants was performed. Results revealed that the GH10 catalytic module is
specific toward the hydrolysis of xylan. Ligand binding results indicate that the
GH10 module and the CBMs act independently, whereas the tandem CBM4s act
synergistically with each other and improve enzymatic activity when assayed on
insoluble polysaccharides. In addition, we show that the UNK protein upstream of 
Pm25 is able to bind arabinoxylan. Altogether, these findings contribute to a
better understanding of the potential role of Xyn10C-like proteins in xylan
utilization systems of gut bacteria.IMPORTANCE Xylan is the major hemicellulosic 
polysaccharide in cereals and contributes to the recalcitrance of the plant cell 
wall toward degradation. Members of the Bacteroidetes, one of the main phyla in
rumen and human gut microbiota, have been shown to encode polysaccharide
utilization loci dedicated to the degradation of xylan. Here, we present the
biochemical characterization of a xylanase encoded by a Bacteroidetes strain
isolated from the termite gut metagenome. This xylanase is a multimodular enzyme,
the sequence of which is interrupted by the insertion of two CBMs from family 4. 
Our results show that this enzyme resembles homologues that were shown to be
important for xylan degradation in rumen or human diet and show that the CBM
insertion in the middle of the sequence seems to be a common feature in xylan
utilization systems. This study shed light on our understanding of xylan
degradation and plant cell wall deconstruction, which can be applied to several
applications in food, feed, and bioeconomy.
