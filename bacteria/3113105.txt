Bellinger H.

The article deals with disinfectants and disinfection during 1955-1985 and
analyses the disinfectant lists no. 1-6 made up by the German Society for Hygiene
and Microbiology. It is shown that changes in test methods may influence the
composition of disinfectants. During the time taken in consideration a change
from phenols/phenol derivatives as main active material in disinfectants to
aldehydes took place. Main active materials in hand disinfectants are the
alcohols ethanol, iso-propanol and n-propanol. Since 1974 (list no. 4) the number
of products based on PVP-iodine for hand disinfectants increases. Strikingly
quaternary ammonium compounds in detergent disinfectants increase as well as sole
active material or in combination with aldehydes. This depends on the fact, that 
their acceptance is well because they are less smelling. On the other hand in
combination with aldehydes they make it possible to reduce the amount of bad
smelling aldehydes.
