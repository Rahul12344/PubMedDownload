IMPORTANCE: Sepsis is considered to induce immune suppression, leading to
increased susceptibility to secondary infections with associated late mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and host genomic characteristics, incidence,
and attributable mortality of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections in
patients admitted to the ICU with or without sepsis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational study comprising
consecutive admissions of more than 48 hours in 2 ICUs in the Netherlands from
January 2011 to July 2013 stratified according to admission diagnosis (sepsis or 
noninfectious).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was ICU-acquired infection (onset
>48 hours). Attributable mortality risk (fraction of mortality that can be
prevented by elimination of the risk factor, acquired infection) was determined
using time-to-event models accounting for competing risk. In a subset of sepsis
admissions (n = 461), blood gene expression (whole-genome transcriptome in
leukocytes) was analyzed at baseline and at onset of ICU-acquired infectious
(n = 19) and noninfectious (n = 9) events.
RESULTS: The primary cohort included 1719 sepsis admissions (1504 patients;
median age, 62 years; interquartile range [IQR], 51-71 years]; 924 men [61.4%]). 
A comparative cohort included 1921 admissions (1825 patients, median age, 62
years; IQR, 49-71 years; 1128 men [61.8%] in whom infection was not present in
the first 48 hours. Intensive care unit-acquired infections occurred in 13.5% of 
sepsis ICU admissions (n = 232) and 15.1% of nonsepsis ICU admissions (n = 291). 
Patients with sepsis who developed an ICU-acquired infection had higher disease
severity scores on admission than patients with sepsis who did not develop an
ICU-acquired infection (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV [APACHE
IV] median score, 90 [IQR, 72-107] vs 79 [IQR, 62-98]; P < .001) and throughout
their ICU stay but did not have differences in baseline gene expression. The
population attributable mortality fraction of ICU-acquired infections in patients
with sepsis was 10.9% (95% CI, 0.9%-20.6%) by day 60; the estimated difference
between mortality in all patients with a sepsis admission diagnosis and mortality
in those without ICU-acquired infection was 2.0% (95% CI, 0.2%-3.8%; P = .03) by 
day 60. Among nonsepsis ICU admissions, ICU-acquired infections had a population 
attributable mortality fraction of 21.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-41.7%) by day 60. Compared
with baseline, blood gene expression at the onset of ICU-acquired infections
showed reduced expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive care unit-acquired infections occurred more 
commonly in patients with sepsis with higher disease severity, but such
infections contributed only modestly to overall mortality. The genomic response
of patients with sepsis was consistent with immune suppression at the onset of
secondary infection.
