Campylobacter concisus is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in the human
oral cavity. It has also been isolated from clinical sources including
gastroenteritis cases. Both secreted and cell-associated hemolytic activities
were detected in C. concisus strains isolated from children with gastroenteritis.
The secreted hemolytic activity of C. concisus strains was labile and was
detected in variable levels from fresh-culture filtrates only. In addition,
another secreted hemolysin/cytotoxin with a molecular weight < 10 kDa was
detected in a single C. concisus strain (RCH 12). A C. concisus genomic library, 
constructed from strain RCH 3 in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, was screened for
hemolytic clones. Subcloning and sequence analysis of selected hemolytic clones
identified ORFs for genes that enhance hemolytic activity but do not appear to be
related to any known hemolysin genes found in Gram-negative bacteria. In a
previous study, a stable cell-associated hemolysin was identified as an
outer-membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) encoded by the pldA gene. In this study,
we report cloning of the pldA gene of the clinical strain C. concisus RCH 3 and
the complementation of phospholipase A activity in an E. coli pldA mutant.
