Emergence of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens is escalating and it is
essential to develop novel strategies to combat these super bugs. LasR is a
regulator switch that plays a vital role in quorum sensing (QS) and pathogenesis 
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The present study reports two novel Mannich base
(1-(phenyl (o-tolylamino) methyl) urea and 3-((1H-Imidazole-1-yl)
methylnaphthalene-2-ol with enhanced anti-QS and antibiofilm activities.
Synthetic compound revealed prolific interaction patterns with LasR quorum
sensing receptor and showed to exhibit LasR antagonistic activities in P.
aeruginosa. In-vitro LasR-inhibitory activities were further confirmed by biofilm
and pyocyanin inhibition assays which showed a dose-dependent activity. The
Mannich base also repressed the mRNA transcripts levels of lasA and lasB genes,
confirming its active role in LasR inhibitory activity. Importantly, C1 and C2
played a crucial role in antagonizing LasR receptor by forming H-bonds with Tyr47
in the LasR active site and the presence of urea moiety on one of the Mannich
base was a discrete advantage. Taken together, the insilico and invitro assays
revealed similar evidences, thus confirming the mode of action of the Mannich
bases. Overall the findings will assist in drug designing and for developing
newer drugs with Mannich bases and its derivatives for treatment of P.
aeruginosa.
