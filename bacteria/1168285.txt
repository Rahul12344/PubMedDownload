[Treatment and results in necrotizing enterocolitis in infancy (author's

[Article in German]

Spier J, HÃ¶pner F.

29 children aged between 1 day and 22 months were treated for enteritis with
complications. 2 children were cured conservatively. In 27 cases surgery was
needed; of these 13 children survived. In 19 patients bacteria were found in the 
stools. Operation was indicated when there was diffuse peritonitis or when
perforation could be shown radiologically. In cases of intestinal perforation the
following technique was used in the last few years: 1. resection of the segment
involved and ileoor colostomy. 2. Anastomosis and closure of colostomy 4--6 weeks
later. Among 29 children with necrotizing enterocolitis there were 12 who also
had malformations of the heart and lungs. This made worse a prognosis which was
bad anyway.
