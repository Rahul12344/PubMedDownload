Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to exhibit important
regulatory roles in multiple malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). hsa-miR-497-5p was reported to involve in cancer progression and poor
prognosis in many kinds of tumors. However, the expression and its clinical
significance of hsa-miR-497-5p in HCC remain unclear.
Methods: In the present study, we investigated the expression of hsa-miR-497-5p
in HCC and analyzed the correction of clinical features with prognosis. The
expression levels of hsa-miR-497-5p and potential target genes were analyzed in
HCC and adjacent noncancerous tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Real-time quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze
hsa-miR-497-5p levels in 328 HCC tissues and 30 paired adjacent noncancer
tissues. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients
with HCC were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.
Results: The hsa-miR-497-5p expression levels were decreased, and its target
genes ACTG1, CSNK1D, PPP1CC, and BIRC5 were upregulated in HCC tissues compared
with normal tissues. Lower levels of hsa-miR-497-5p expression and higher levels 
of the four target genes were significantly associated with higher tumor
diameter. Moreover, patients with lower hsa-miR-497-5p expression and higher
target genes levels had shorter OS.
Conclusion: The expression levels of hsa-miR-497-5p may play an important
regulatory role in HCC and are closely correlated with HCC progression and poor
prognosis in patients. The hsa-miR-497-5p may be a specific therapeutic target
for the treatment of HCC.
