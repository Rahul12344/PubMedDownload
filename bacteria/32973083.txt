Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a recalcitrant disease where limited
therapeutic options have not improved overall survival, and approved targeted
therapies are lacking. Amplification of the tyrosine kinase receptor FGFR1
(fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) is one of the few actionable alterations
found in the SCLC genome. However, efforts to develop targeted therapies for
FGFR1-amplified SCLC are hindered by critical gaps in knowledge around the
molecular origins and mediators of FGFR1-driven signaling as well as the
physiologic impact of targeting FGFR1. Here we show that increased FGFR1 promotes
tumorigenic progression in precancerous neuroendocrine cells and is required for 
SCLC development in vivo. Notably, Fgfr1 knockout suppressed tumor development in
a mouse model lacking the retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (Rbl2) tumor suppressor
gene but did not affect a model with wild-type Rbl2. In support of a functional
interaction between these two genes, loss of RBL2 induced FGFR1 expression and
restoration of RBL2 repressed it, suggesting a novel role for RBL2 as a regulator
of FGFR1 in SCLC. Additionally, FGFR1 activated phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1), 
whereas chemical inhibition of PLCG1 suppressed SCLC growth, implicating PLCG1 as
an effector of FGFR1 signaling in SCLC. Collectively, this study uncovers
mechanisms underlying FGFR1-driven SCLC that involve RBL2 upstream and PLCG1
downstream, thus providing potential biomarkers for anti-FGFR1 therapy.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies RBL2 and PLCG1 as critical components of
amplified FGFR1 signaling in SCLC, thus representing potential targets for
biomarker analysis and therapeutic development in this disease.
