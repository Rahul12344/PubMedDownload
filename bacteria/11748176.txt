Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing unmethylated CpG motifs activate immune
cells to produce cytokines. CpG ODNs protect mice against infections with
intracellular bacteria by the induction of a T helper 1 (Th1) response. To
determine the effect of CpG ODNs in pulmonary tuberculosis, mice were treated
with CpG ODNs or control ODNs at the time of intranasal infection. CpG ODNs
reduced mycobacterial outgrowth for up to 5 weeks after Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection and were associated with a decrease in inflammation in
lung tissue. CpG treatment was also associated with elevated levels of gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) and decreased levels of interleukin 4 in the lungs and an 
increased capacity of splenocytes to secrete Th1-type cytokines. CpG ODNs given 2
weeks after infection were still able to reduce mycobacterial outgrowth and to
enhance a Th1 response 5 weeks postinfection. Administration of CpG ODNs to
IFN-gamma-gene-deficient mice failed to reduce mycobacterial outgrowth. These
data suggest that CpG ODNs improve host defense during pulmonary tuberculosis by 
an IFN-gamma-dependent mechanism.
