OBJECTIVES: Addition of chlorhexidine has enhanced the antimicrobial effect of
glass ionomer cement (GIC) indicated to Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART);
however, the impact of this mixture on the properties of these materials and on
the longevity of restorations must be investigated. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the effects of incorporating chlorhexidine (CHX) in the in vitro
biological and chemical-mechanical properties of GIC and in vivo clinical/
microbiological follow-up of the ART with GIC containing or not CHX.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For in vitro studies, groups were divided into GIC, GIC
with 1.25% CHX, and GIC with 2.5% CHX. Antimicrobial activity of GIC was analyzed
using agar diffusion and anti-biofilm assays. Cytotoxic effects, compressive
tensile strength, microhardness and fluoride (F) release were also evaluated. A
randomized controlled trial was conducted on 36 children that received ART either
with GIC or GIC with CHX. Saliva and biofilm were collected for mutans
streptococci (MS) counts and the survival rate of restorations was checked after 
7 days, 3 months and one year after ART. ANOVA/Tukey or Kruskal-Wallis/
Mann-Whitney tests were performed for in vitro tests and in vivo microbiological 
analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank tests were applied to estimate
survival percentages of restorations (p<0.05).
RESULTS: Incorporation of 1.25% and 2.5% CHX improved the
antimicrobial/anti-biofilm activity of GIC, without affecting F release and
mechanical characteristics, but 2.5% CHX was cytotoxic. Survival rate of
restorations using GIC with 1.25% CHX was similar to GIC. A significant reduction
of MS levels was observed for KM+CHX group in children saliva and biofilm 7 days 
after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of 1.25% CHX increased the in vitro antimicrobial 
activity, without changing chemical-mechanical properties of GIC and
odontoblast-like cell viability. This combination improved the in vivo short-term
microbiological effect without affecting clinical performance of ART
restorations.
