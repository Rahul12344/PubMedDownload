The activation and eventual clonal expansion of individual antigen-specific CD4+ 
T cell clones are dependent on the production of autocrine growth factors such as
interleukin-2 (IL-2). The specificity of CD4+ T cell activation is imparted by T 
cell antigen receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide antigens bound to class II
major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded molecules on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), for example B cells, macrophages, and dendritic 
cells. To induce maximal IL-2 production by T cells, however, APCs must also
provide non-antigen-specific costimulatory signals. Recent work indicates that
APC-derived costimulatory signals play a critical role in determining whether
lymphokine production, apoptotic cell death, or functional anergy is induced by
TCR engagement. This information has allowed immunologists to manipulate
costimulatory molecules to prevent allograft rejection and enhance tumor
immunity. Here we review current information on the biologic effects of, and
signal transduction pathways engaged by, several known receptor-ligand pairs that
transduce costimulatory signals in T cells. Special emphasis will be placed on
the interaction of CD28 on the T cell with its ligands, B7-1, B7-2, and B7-3 on
the APC.
