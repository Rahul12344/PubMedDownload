Maximal expression of the interleukin-2 gene in T cells depends on biochemical
signals in addition to those transduced by the T cell antigen receptor. Recent
work indicates that the T-cell specific molecule CD28 transduces a
'costimulatory' signal when it binds its ligand, the B7 molecule, on the surface 
of an antigen-presenting cell. Results from experiments performed during the past
year have raised the exciting possibility that immune responses can be either
inhibited or augmented by manipulation of the CD28-B7 interaction.
