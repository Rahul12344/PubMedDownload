Hematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor (HPC) cells are regulated by interacting 
signals and cellular and noncellular elements of the hematopoietic niche. We
previously showed that CD166 is a functional marker of murine and human HSC and
of cellular components of the murine niche. Selection of murine CD166+ engrafting
HSC enriched for marrow repopulating cells. Here, we demonstrate that CD166-CD166
homophilic interactions enhance generation of murine and human HPC in vitro and
augment hematopoietic function of these cells. Interactions between cultured
CD166+ Lineage- Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cells and CD166+ osteoblasts (OBs)
significantly enhanced the expansion of colony-forming units (CFUs). Interactions
between CD166+ LSK cells and immobilized CD166 protein generated more CFU in
short-term cultures than between these cells and bovine serum albumin (BSA) or in
cultures initiated with CD166- LSK cells. Similar results were obtained when LSK 
cells from wildtype (WT) or CD166 knockout (KO) (CD166-/- ) mice were used with
immobilized CD166. Human cord blood CD34+ cells expressing CD166 produced
significantly higher numbers of CFUs following interaction with immobilized CD166
than their CD166- counterparts. These data demonstrate the positive effects of
CD166 homophilic interactions involving CD166 on the surface of murine and human 
HPCs. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of CD150+ CD48- (signaling lymphocyte
activation molecule (SLAM)) LSK cells from WT and CD166-/- mice incubated with
immobilized CD166 protein revealed that engagement of CD166 on these cells
activates cytokine, growth factor and hormone signaling, epigenetic pathways, and
other genes implicated in maintenance of stem cell pluripotency-related and
mitochondria-related signaling pathways. These studies provide tangible evidence 
implicating CD166 engagement in the maintenance of stem/progenitor cell function.
