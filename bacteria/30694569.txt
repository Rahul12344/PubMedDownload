Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous group of
inflammation-mediated pathologies that include Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis and primarily affects the colon and small intestine. Previous studies
have shown that a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, a membrane-bound
sheddase, capable of cleaving the proinflammatory cytokine TNF and epidermal
growth factor receptor ligands, plays a critical role in maintaining gut
homeostasis and modulating intestinal inflammation during IBD. Rhomboid 5 homolog
2 (RHBDF2), a catalytically inactive member of the rhomboid family of
intramembrane serine proteases, was recently identified as a crucial regulator of
ADAM17. Here, we assessed the role of RHBDF2 in the development of colitis in the
context of IL10 deficiency. Il10-/- /Rhbdf2-/- mice developed spontaneous colitis
and experienced severe weight loss starting at 8 wk of age, without the need for 
exogenous triggers. Severity of disease pathology in Il10-/- /Rhbdf2-/- mice
correlated with a dysbiotic gut microbiota and elevated Th1-associated immune
responses with increased interferon gamma and IL2 production. In addition,
Il10-/- /Rhbdf2-/- mice failed to maintain their epithelial cell homeostasis,
although the intestinal epithelial barrier of Rhbdf2-/- mice is intact and loss
of Rhbdf2 did not significantly exacerbate sensitivity to dextran sulfate
sodium-induced colitis, suggesting differences in the underlying disease pathway 
of intestinal inflammation in this model. Taken together, our results demonstrate
a critical regulatory role for RHBDF2 in the maintenance of the unique
homeostasis between intestinal microbiota and host immune responses in the gut
that is dysregulated during the pathogenesis of IBD.
