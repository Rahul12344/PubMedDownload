Cancer progression involves multiple genetic and epigenetic events, which involve
gain-of-functions of oncogenes and loss-of-functions of tumor suppressor genes.
Classical tumor suppressor genes are recessive in nature, anti-proliferative, and
frequently found inactivated or mutated in cancers. However, extensive research
over the last few years have elucidated that certain tumor suppressor genes do
not conform to these standard definitions and might act as "double agents",
playing contrasting roles in vivo in cells, where either due to
haploinsufficiency, epigenetic hypermethylation, or due to involvement with
multiple genetic and oncogenic events, they play an enhanced proliferative role
and facilitate the pathogenesis of cancer. This review discusses and highlights
some of these exceptions; the genetic events, cellular contexts, and mechanisms
by which four important tumor suppressors-pRb, PTEN, FOXO, and PML display their 
oncogenic potentials and pro-survival traits in cancer.
