The activating receptor NKG2D recognizes a wide range of different ligands, some 
of which are primarily expressed in "stressed" tissues or on tumor cells. Until
now, similar stimulatory effects on natural killer and CD8+ T cells have been
described for all NKG2D ligands, and the NKG2D receptor/ligand system has
therefore been interpreted as a sensor system involved in tumor immune
surveillance and activation of immune responses. We show here that the NKG2D
ligands H60 and MIC class 1 chain-related protein A (MICA) can also mediate
strong suppressive effects on T cell proliferation. Responsiveness to H60- and
MICA-mediated suppression requires IL-10 and involves a receptor other than
NKG2D. These findings might provide explanations for the observation that strong 
in vivo NKG2D ligand expression, such as that on tumor cells, sometimes fails to 
support effective immune responses and links this observation to a distinct
subgroup of NKG2D ligands.
