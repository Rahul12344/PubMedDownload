Interactions between DDT and river fungi. I. Effects of p,p'-DDT on the growth of
aquatic hyphomycetes.

Dalton SA, Hodkinson M, Smith KA.

Concentrations of p,p'-DDT between 0.1 and 60 mug/ml enhanced the growth rate of 
Heliscus submersus, and concentrations greater than 2 mug/ml had a similar effect
on Tetracladium setigerum, Varicosporium elodeae, and Clavariopsis aquatica. The 
rate of growth of each fungus increased with increased DDT concentration.
