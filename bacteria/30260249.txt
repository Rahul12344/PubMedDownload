To resolve the problems of bacterial infections and the low efficiency of
osteogenesis of implanted titanium alloys in clinical dental and bone therapy, we
developed a bifunctional titanium alloy (Ti) with a nano-hydroxyapatite (HA)
coating (HBD + BMP/HA-Ti), which enables the sustained release of the natural
antimicrobial peptide human β-defensin 3 (HBD-3) and bone morphogenetic protein-2
(BMP-2). Due to the poriferous nano-sized structure of the HA coating with a
20-30 μm thickness, the HBD + BMP/HA-Ti material had a high encapsulation
efficiency (>74%) and exhibited synchronized slow release of HBD-3 and BMP-2. In 
an antibacterial test, HBD + BMP/HA-Ti prevented the growth of bacteria in an
inoculated medium, and its surface remained free from viable bacteria after a
continuous incubation with Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains for 7 days.
Furthermore, good adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of
hBMSCs in contact with HBD + BMP/HA-Ti were achieved in 7 days. Therefore, the
bifunctional titanium alloy HBD + BMP/HA-Ti has a great potential for eventual
applications in the protection of implants against bacteria in the orthopaedic
and dental clinic.
