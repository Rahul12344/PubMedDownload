We present the results of studies of an aqueous sample of a highly [15N,2H]
enriched protein, the SH3 domain from Fyn. Measurements of 1H relaxation and
interactions between H2O solvent and exchangeable protons are given, as well as a
method for increasing the effective longitudinal relaxation of solvent
exchangeable proton resonances. The long-range isotope shifts are measured, for
1H and 15N, which arise due to perdeuteration. Simulations, which employed a 7 or
8 spin relaxation matrix analysis, were compared to the experimental data from a 
time series of 2D NOESY datasets for some resonances. The agreement between
experiment and simulation suggest that, with this 1H dilute sample, relatively
long mixing times (up to 1.2 s) can be used to detect specific dipolar
interactions between amide protons up to about 7A apart. A set of 155 inter-amide
NOEs and 7 side chain NOEs were thus identified in a series of 3D HSQC-NOESY-HSQC
experiments. These data, alone and in combination with previously collected
restraints, were used to calculate sets of structures using X-PLOR. These results
are compared to the available X-ray and NMR structures of the Fyn SH3 domain.
