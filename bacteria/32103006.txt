NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells (ILC) modulate tissue homeostasis and anti-microbial
immune responses. ILC development and function are regulated by cytokines such as
Interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-15. However, the ILC-intrinsic pathways translating
cytokine signals into developmental programs are largely unknown. Here we show
that the anti-apoptotic molecule cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) 
is crucial for the generation of IL-7/IL-15-dependent NKp46+ ILC1, including
conventional natural killer (cNK) cells, and ILC3. Cytokine-induced
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)
precedes up-regulation of c-FLIP, which protects developing NKp46+ ILC from
TNF-induced apoptosis. NKp46+ ILC-specific inactivation of c-FLIP leads to the
loss of all IL-7/IL-15-dependent NKp46+ ILC, thereby inducing early-onset chronic
colitis and subsequently microbial dysbiosis; meanwhile, the depletion of cNK,
but not NKp46+ ILC1/3, aggravates experimental colitis. In summary, our data
demonstrate a non-redundant function of c-FLIP for the generation of NKp46+ ILC, 
which protect T/B lymphocyte-sufficient mice from intestinal inflammation.
