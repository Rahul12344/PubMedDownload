The lipase was partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and gel
filtration column chromatography, and was characterized from Geobacillus
stearothermophilus AH22 strain. The lipase was purified 18.3-folds with 19.7%
recovery. The lipase activity was determined by using p-nitrophenyl esters
(C2-C12) as substrates. The Km values of the enzyme for these substrates were
found as 0.16, 0.02, 0.19 and 0.55 mM, respectively, while Vmax values were 0.52,
1.03, 0.72 and 0.15 U mg(-1). The enzyme showed maximum activity at 50 °C and
between pH 8.0 and 9.0. The enzyme was found to be quite stable at pH range of
4.0-10.0, and thermal stability between 50 and 60 °C. It was found that the best 
inhibitory effect of the enzyme activity was of Hg(2+). The inhibitory effect as 
orlistat, catechin, propyl paraben, p-coumaric acid, 3,4-dihydroxy hydro-cinnamic
acid was examined. These results suggest that G. stearothermophilus AH22 lipase
presents very suitable properties for industrial applications.
