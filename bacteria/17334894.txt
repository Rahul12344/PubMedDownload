In Germany the drinking water is to be monitored regularly. The sampling
frequencies and the scale of monitoring of the water supplies are provided by the
Drinking Water Ordinance 2001. Taking into account the overall samples taken, the
drinking water quality ranges from good to very good, and the requirements for
the microbiological, chemical and physical standards have been largely satisfied,
as set out by the Drinking Water Ordinance 2001. What concerns most parameters,
unremarkable variations have been measured in more than 99 % of samples taken.
The highest frequency of non-compliance (in 1 to 2 % of samples taken) has been
found in the parameters pesticides and coliform bacteria. Some impairments of
drinking water quality could be traced to house installation systems, which do
not meet the commonly accepted technical rules. In general, potential danger to
human health does not exist. This information is based on the report by the
Ministry of Health about the quality of drinking water in Germany in the period
2002-2004.
