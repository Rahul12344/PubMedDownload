BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common indication for
autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT).
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective noninterventional study aimed to
evaluate the impact of mobilization characteristics and graft cellular content on
hematologic recovery and outcome after auto-SCT among 68 patients with DLBCL.
RESULTS: Better mobilization capacity as manifested by blood CD34+ cell count
>32 × 106 /L and CD34+ cell yield of the first apheresis >2.75 × 106 /kg
correlated with faster neutrophil (P = .005 and P = .017) and platelet (P = .002 
and P < .001) recovery. A higher number of infused CD34+ cells (> 2.65 × 106 /kg)
was associated with better 5-year overall survival (OS; 95% vs 67%, P = .012).
The graft CD34+ CD133+ CD38- cell count >0.07 × 106 /kg was predictive of better 
5-year OS (87% vs 63%; P = .008) and higher graft CD3+ cell count (>23.1 × 106
/kg) correlated also with better 5-year OS (80% vs 40%, P = .008). In
multivariate analysis only disease status of CR I at auto-SCT was associated with
better progression-free survival (P = .014) and OS (P = .039).
CONCLUSION: The mobilization capacity of CD34+ cells impacted on early
hematologic recovery in patients with DLBCL after auto-SCT. Higher graft CD34+
cell count and both CD34+ CD133+ CD38- and CD3+ cells were also associated with
better OS. The effect of optimal graft cellular composition on outcome in DLBCL
should be evaluated in a randomized study.
