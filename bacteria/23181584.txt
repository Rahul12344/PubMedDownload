Using high-speed scanning atomic force microscopy, we directly observed
single-molecular enzymatic elongation of hyaluronan polymer chains at intervals
of 10 s on a mica or lipid bilayer surface, on which Pasteurella multocida
hyaluronic acid synthase (pmHAS) was immobilized. The reaction was started by the
addition of both UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine monomers. The
average catalytic elongation rate constant (k(cat)) was found to be 1.8 mer s(-1)
from one active enzyme physically adsorbed on a mica surface. When pmHAS was
immobilized by inserting its hydrophobic tail part into lipid bilayers, most of
the enzymes retained their activity, and the k(cat) values were found to be in
the range 1-10 mer s(-1) for 29 enzymes (average was k(cat) = 2-4 mer s(-1)).
These k(cat) values were lowest level of k(cat) = 1-100 s(-1) obtained in bulk
solution by radioisotope methods.
