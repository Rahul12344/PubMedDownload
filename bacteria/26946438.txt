In this study, we successfully tracked the dynamic changes in different
constitutes of bound extracellular polymeric substances (bEPS), soluble microbial
products (SMP), and permeate during the operation of bench scale membrane
bioreactors (MBRs) via fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined
with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Three fluorescent groups were
identified, including two protein-like (tryptophan-like C1 and tyrosine-like C2) 
and one microbial humic-like components (C3). In bEPS, protein-like components
were consistently more dominant than C3 during the MBR operation, while their
relative abundance in SMP depended on aeration intensities. C1 of bEPS exhibited 
a linear correlation (R(2)=0.738; p<0.01) with bEPS amounts in sludge, and C2 was
closely related to the stability of sludge. The protein-like components were more
greatly responsible for membrane fouling. Our study suggests that EEM-PARAFAC can
be a promising monitoring tool to provide further insight into process evaluation
and membrane fouling during MBR operation.
