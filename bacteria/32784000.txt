The present study investigated the effect of culture extracts (CB08035-SCA and
CB08035-SYP) from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus (strain CB08035) on cell
viability and the potential protective effects attributed to molecular mechanisms
underlying antioxidant response to survive oxidative stress injuries.
Caco-2 cells were submitted to oxidative stress by treatment with tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). Both extracts prevented cell damage and enhanced activity
of antioxidant defenses (NQO1 and GST activities and GSH levels) reduced by
treatment with t-BOOH. Increased ROS and caspase 3/7 activity induced by t-BOOH
were dose-dependently prevented when cells were treated with the extracts.
CB08035-SCA caused up-regulation of Nrf2, AKT1 and Bcl-2 gene expressions.
Moreover, CB08035-SCA and CB08035-SYP treatments reduced significantly Bax,
BNIP3, APAF1, ERK1, JNK1, MAPK1, NFκB1, TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and HO-1 gene
expressions of apoptosis, proinflammation and oxidative stress induced by t-BOOH.
CB08035-SCA and CB08035-SYP CPE extracts confer a significant protection against 
oxidative insults to cells. Our results show that culture extracts CB08035-SCA
and CB08035-SYP from M. hydrocarbonoclasticus (strain CB08035) appeared to have
antioxidant potential, based on their ability to protect antioxidant enzymes and 
mRNA gene expressions linked to apoptosis/oxidative pathways. These results
suggest that culture extracts CB08035-SCA and CB08035-SYP can be a potential
ingredient in the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries.
