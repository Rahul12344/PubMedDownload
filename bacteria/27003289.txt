Leishmania donovani causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the second most deadly
vector-borne parasitic disease. A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent
(ISC) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30,000 deaths per year. Resistance
against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the
persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204
clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of L. donovani from the
ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck
coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population
frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the
aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent
antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations, and
show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination. Our results reveal 
the complexity of L. donovani evolution in the ISC in response to drug treatment.
