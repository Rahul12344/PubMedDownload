Using a modified cold enrichment procedure Yersinia spp. were detected in 90.6%
out of 32 raw waste water samples obtained within one year from two municipal
sewage treatment plants. Moreover Yersinia were isolated from 50% of 6 effluent
samples. Altogether 118 Yersinia strains were isolated and typed biochemically
and serologically. 69 out of these isolates belonged to Yersinia enterocolitica, 
60 strains to biotype 1, and 9 to biotype 4, serotype 0:3, 8 strains Yersinia
enterocolitica serotype 0:3, biotype 4, considered to be a causative agent in
human enteritis, harboured an 48 MD plasmid. The remaining isolates were
identified as Yersinia frederiksenii (24 strains), Yersinia intermedia (22
strains) and Yersinia kristensenii (3 strains). The frequency of the isolation of
Y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3, biotype 4 from sewage showed the same seasonal
dependence as known from strains of human origin. In contrast to this, such
dependence could not be found among other serovars of Y. enterocolitica and
related species.
