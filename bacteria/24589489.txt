Targeting PqsD is a promising novel approach to disrupt bacterial
cell-to-cell-communication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In search of selective PqsD
inhibitors, two series of benzamidobenzoic acids - one published as RNAP
inhibitors and the other as PqsD inhibitors - were investigated for inhibitory
activity toward the respective other enzyme. Additionally, novel derivatives were
synthesized and biologically evaluated. By this means, the structural features
needed for benzamidobenzoic acids to be potent and, most notably, selective PqsD 
inhibitors were identified. The most interesting compound of this study was the
3-Cl substituted compound 5 which strongly inhibits PqsD (IC₅₀ 6.2 μM) while
exhibiting no inhibition of RNAP.
