DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) block the progress of the replication and
transcription machineries and can weaken chromosomal stability, resulting in
various diseases. FANCD2-FANCI-associated nuclease (FAN1) is a conserved
structure-specific nuclease that unhooks DNA ICLs independently of the Fanconi
anemia pathway. Recent structural studies have proposed two different mechanistic
features for ICL unhooking by human FAN1: a specific basic pocket that recognizes
the terminal phosphate of a 1-nucleotide (nt) 5' flap or FAN1 dimerization.
Herein, we show that despite lacking these features, Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAN1 
(PaFAN1) cleaves substrates at ∼3-nt intervals and resolves ICLs. Crystal
structures of PaFAN1 bound to various DNA substrates revealed that its conserved 
basic Arg/Lys patch comprising Arg-228 and Lys-260 recognizes phosphate groups
near the 5' terminus of a DNA substrate with a 1-nt flap or a nick. Substitution 
of Lys-260 did not affect PaFAN1's initial endonuclease activity but
significantly decreased its subsequent exonuclease activity and ICL unhooking.
The Arg/Lys patch also interacted with phosphates at a 3-nt gap, and this
interaction could drive movement of the scissile phosphates into the
PaFAN1-active site. In human FAN1, the ICL-resolving activity was not affected by
individual disruption of the Arg/Lys patch or basic pocket. However, simultaneous
substitution of both FAN1 regions significantly reduced its ICL-resolving
activity, suggesting that these two basic regions play a complementary role in
ICL repair. On the basis of these findings, we propose a conserved role for two
basic regions in FAN1 to guide ICL unhooking and to maintain genomic stability.
