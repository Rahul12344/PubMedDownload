In Vibrio cholerae, bioinformatic approaches have been used to predict the
locations of numerous small RNA (sRNA)-encoding genes, but biological roles have 
been determined for very few. Here, we describe the expression, processing and
biological role of an sRNA (previously known as A10) that was identified through 
such analyses. We have renamed this sRNA MicX as, like the Escherichia coli sRNAs
MicA, MicC and MicF, it regulates expression of an outer membrane protein (OMP). 
MicX appears to be a direct negative regulator of vc0972, which encodes an
uncharacterized OMP, and vc0620, which encodes the periplasmic component of a
peptide ABC transporter. Hfq is apparently not required for MicX's interactions
with and regulation of these targets. The sequence encoding MicX overlaps with
vca0943; however, primary transcripts of MicX are processed in an RNase E- and
Hfq-dependent fashion to a shorter, still active and much more stable form
consisting largely of the vca0943 3' untranslated region. Our data suggest that
processing of MicX enhances its effectiveness, and that sRNA cleavage is not
simply a means to sRNA inactivation and clearance.
