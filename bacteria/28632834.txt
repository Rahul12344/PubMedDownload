Vesical fungus ball is a mobile, oval and echogenic mass as a result of
accumulation of long and wide numerous hyphae. Fungal urinary tract infection
incidence has increased notoriously and there are isolated yeast in 7 to 8% of
urine cultures. Different species of Candida are cause of urinary tract
infection. Epidemiologically, the first isolated pathogen is Candida albicans,
followed by Candida tropicalis. Bladder poll has been documented as the most
important risk factor for candiduria in critical patients into intensive care.
