A cDNA library from a poorly differentiated human pancreatic tumor cell line was 
screened for differentially expressed mRNAs using single-stranded cDNA probes
synthesized from poly(A+) RNA of the poorly differentiated cell line Panc 1 and a
very well differentiated cell line CD11. One of the cDNA clones isolated
hybridized to a transcript size of 650 base pairs on Northern blot analysis and
showed 30-fold higher expression in the poorly differentiated cell line as
compared with the well differentiated cell line. Sequence analysis of this cDNA
clone and its deduced amino acid sequence showed an open reading frame of 441
nucleotides with 100 and 98.6% homology to ribosomal protein S16 (rpS16) from rat
and mouse, respectively. Northern blot analyses with a panel of 14 pancreatic
cell lines, 2 breast cell lines, 2 colon cell lines, and several other tissues
showed higher expression of rpS16 only in the poorly differentiated pancreatic
tumor cell line Panc 1. The expression of mRNA for two other ribosomal proteins, 
rpL30 and rpL32, were not elevated in Panc 1. Southern blot analysis of genomic
DNA showed a 20-fold amplification of a single band among the rpS16 family only
in the Panc 1 cell line.
