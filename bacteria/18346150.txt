BACKGROUND: Canine lymphoproliferative disease often presents with lymphocytosis 
and is immunophenotypically diverse.
HYPOTHESIS: Immunophenotype predicts prognosis in canine lymphoproliferative
disorders involving circulating lymphocytosis.
ANIMALS: Dogs that had peripheral blood evaluation performed by flow cytometry by
the Clinical Immunology Service at Colorado State University between 2003 and
2005.
METHODS: Outcome data regarding treatment and survival were sought on patients
with lymphocytosis comprising a single lymphocyte subset. Ninety-six patients
that met the inclusion criteria had sufficient follow-up information to be
included in the study.
RESULTS: Four main phenotypic classifications were found: CD8+ T-cell, CD21+
B-cell, CD4-8-5+ (aberrant T-cell phenotype), and CD34+ (undifferentiated
progenitor). Expression of CD34 predicted poor outcome with median survival of 16
days (P < .0001) compared with other phenotypes. Within the CD8+ phenotype, dogs 
presenting with a lymphocytosis >30,000 lymphocytes/muL had significantly shorter
median survival (131 days) than those presenting with <30,000 lymphocytes/muL
(1098 days, P < .0008). Within the T-cell leukemias, there was no difference in
outcome between dogs with CD4-8-5+ leukemia and dogs with the CD8+ T-cell
phenotype nor was the loss of expression of the pan-leukocyte marker CD45
associated with decreased survival time. A CD21+ lymphocytosis composed of large 
cells was associated with shorter survival time (129 days) than those with
smaller circulating cells (median survival not reached, P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Immunophenotyping provides an objective
method for determining prognosis in lymphoproliferative disorders characterized
by lymphocytosis.
