Simocyclinone D8 (1, SD8) has attracted attention due to its highly complex
hybrid structure and the unusual way it inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase by
preventing DNA binding to the enzyme. Although a hypothesis explaining
simocyclinone biosynthesis has been previously proposed, little was proven in
vivo due to the genetic inaccessibility of the producer strain. Herein, we report
discovery of three new D-type simocyclinones (D9, D10, and D11) produced by
Kitasatospora sp. and Streptomyces sp. NRRL B-24484, as well as the
identification and annotation of their biosynthetic gene clusters. Unexpectedly, 
the arrangement of the newly discovered biosynthetic gene clusters is starkly
different from the previously published one, despite the nearly identical
structures of D8 and D9 simocyclinones. The gene inactivation and expression
studies have disproven the role of a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) system in 
the assembly of the linear dicarboxylic acid. Instead, the new stand-alone
ketosynthase genes were shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the tetraene 
chain. Additionally, we identified the gene responsible for the conversion of
simocyclinone D9 (2, SD9) into D8.
