Pasteuria penetrans is a Gram-positive endospore-producing bacterium that is a
parasite of root-knot nematodes. Attachment of endospores to the cuticle of the
nematode is the first stage in the infection process. Western blot analysis with 
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that recognize the 30 kDa heparin-binding
domain (HBD) and the 45 kDa gelatin-binding domain (GBD) fragments of human
fibronectin (Fn) revealed a series of polypeptides of approximately 40, 45 and 55
kDa present in crude cuticle extracts of Meloidogyne javanica 2nd-stage
juveniles. The results suggest that the structure of the nematode fibronectin is 
different to the fibronectins so far characterized. Pre-treatment of endospores
of Pasteuria with either the HBD or the GBD was found to inhibit binding to the
nematode cuticle. The larger GBD fragment was the most effective at blocking
adhesion. Pre-treatment of the GBD fragment with gelatin prevented the GBD
fragment from inhibiting endospore attachment to the nematode cuticle.
