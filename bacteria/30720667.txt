OBJECTIVE: Antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) is a
serious adverse drug reaction, and its pathogenic mechanism has not been
elucidated thoroughly to date. A recent genome-wide association study reported
that seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the family with sequence
similarity 65, member B gene (FAM65B), ATP/GTP-binding protein-like 4 gene
(AGBL4), and cut-like homeobox 2 gene (CUX2) were associated strongly with ATDH
in Ethiopian patients. We validated this relationship in a Chinese Han anti-TB
treatment population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 1 : 2 matched case-control study was carried out of 235
ATDH cases and 470 controls. Multivariate conditional logistic regression
analysis was used to estimate the association between genotypes and risk of ATDH 
by odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and weight and hepatoprotectant use
were used as covariates.
RESULTS: Patients with a polymorphism at rs10946737 in the FAM65B gene were at an
increased risk of moderate and severe liver injury under the dominant model
(adjusted odds ratio=2.147, 95% confidence interval: 1.067-4.323, P=0.032). No
other genotypes or genetic risk scores were found to be significantly related to 
ATDH.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to explore and validate the relationships
between seven SNPs in the FAM65B, AGBL4, and CUX2 genes and ATDH in a Chinese
population. On the basis of this case-control study, SNP rs10946737 in FAM65B may
be associated with susceptibility to ATDH in Chinese Han anti-TB treatment
patients. Further research is warranted to explain the role of the FAM65B gene
and its contribution toward individual differences in susceptibility to ATDH.
