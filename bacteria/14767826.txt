Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid with proinflammatory
properties that binds to a specific receptor (PAF receptor [PAFR]) that is
expressed on many different cell types. PAFR is able to bind phosphorylcholine,
which is present in both PAF and the pneumococcal cell wall. Activation of
respiratory epithelial cells in vitro results in up-regulation of PAFR, which, in
turn, facilitates invasion of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To determine the role of 
PAFR in host defense against pneumococcal pneumonia, PAFR-deficient (PAFR(-/-))
and wild-type (wt) mice were inoculated intranasally with S. pneumoniae.
PAFR(-/-) mice were relatively resistant to pneumococcal pneumonia, as indicated 
by delayed and reduced mortality, diminished outgrowth of pneumococci in lungs,
and reduced dissemination of the infection (all P<.05, vs. wt mice). PAFR(-/-)
mice also had less pulmonary inflammation. These data provide evidence that PAFR 
is used by S. pneumoniae to induce lethal pneumonia.
