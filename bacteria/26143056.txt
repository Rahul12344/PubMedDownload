Many studies have been performed to determine the interaction between bacterial
species and cancer. However, there has been no attempts to demonstrate a possible
relationship between Enterobacter spp. and colon cancer so far. Therefore, in the
present study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of Enterobacter strains on 
colon cancer. Bacterial proteins were isolated from 11 Enterobacter spp., one
Morganella morganii, and one Escherichia coli strains, and applied onto NCM460
(Incell) and CRL1790 (ATCC) cell lines. Cell viability and proliferation were
determined in MTS assay. Flow Cytometry was used to detect CD24 level and
apoptosis. Real-Time PCR studies were performed to determine NFKB and Bcl2
expression. Graphpad Software was used for statistical analysis. The results
showed that proteins, isolated from the Enterobacter spp., have significantly
increased cell viability and proliferation, while decreasing the apoptosis of the
cell lines tested. The data in the present study indicated that Enterobacter
strains might promote colon cancer. Moreover, Enterobacter spp. could be a
clinically important factor for colon cancer initiation and progression. Studies 
can be extended on animal models in order to develop new strategies for
treatment.
