Tertiary structure of supercoiled DNA is a significant factor in a number of
genetic functions and is apparently affected by environmental conditions. We
applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) for imaging the supercoiled DNA deposited
at different ionic conditions. We have employed a technique for the sample
preparation that permits high-resolution AFM imaging of DNA bound to the surface 
in buffer solutions without drying the sample (AFM in situ). The AFM data show
that at low ionic strength, DNA molecules are loosely interwound supercoils with 
an irregular shape. Plectonemic superhelices are formed in high-concentration,
near-physiological salt solutions. At such ionic conditions, superhelical loops
are typically separated by regions of close helix-helix contacts. The data
obtained show directly and unambiguously that overall geometry of supercoiled DNA
depends dramatically on ionic conditions. This fact and the formation of close
contacts between DNA helices are important features of supercoiled DNA related to
its biological functions.
