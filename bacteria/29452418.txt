The differentiation status of neuroblastoma (NB) strongly correlates with its
clinical outcomes; however, the molecular mechanisms driving maintenance of
stemness and differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that plant
homeodomain finger-containing protein 20 (PHF20) functions as a critical
epigenetic regulator in sustaining stem cell-like phenotype of NB by using
CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted knockout (KO) for high-throughput screening of gene
function in NB cell differentiation. The expression of PHF20 in NB was
significantly associated with high aggressiveness of the tumor and poor outcomes 
for NB patients. Deletion of PHF20 inhibited NB cell proliferation, invasive
migration, and stem cell-like traits. Mechanistically, PHF20 interacts with
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and directly binds to promoter regions of
octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and sex determining region Y-box 2 
(SOX2) to modulate a histone mark associated with active transcription,
trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 protein subunit (H3K4me3).
Overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 restored growth and progression of PHF20 KO tumor
cells. Consistently, OCT4 and SOX2 protein levels in clinical NB specimens were
positively correlated with PHF20 expression. Our results establish PHF20 as a key
driver of NB stem cell-like properties and aggressive behaviors, with
implications for prognosis and therapy.
