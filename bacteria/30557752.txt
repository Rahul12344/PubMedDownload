To understand the ability of an upflow microaerobic biofilm reactor (UMBR) to
remove nutrient from manure-free swine wastewater rich in NH4+ with a COD/TN
ratio less than 1.00, effect of hydraulic loading rate (HLR) on the microaerobic 
process was evaluated with a constant reflux ratio of 25 at 25 °C. The results
showed that changes in HLR had a remarkable effect on the performance of the UMBR
in nutrient removal from the wastewater. With the favorable HLR 3.0 m3/(m3·d)
(Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) 8 h), average removal of COD, NH4+ and TN in the 
microaerobic process reached 59.3%, 87.7% and 84.7%, respectively, though the
COD/TN ratio was as low as 0.84. With an over HLR of 4.0 m3/(m3·d) (HRT decreased
to 6 h), bad performance of the UMBR was observed with an average removal of COD,
NH4+ and TN as low as 45.0%, 59.0% and 57.5%, respectively. Since the HLR was
decreased to 2.4 m3/(m3·d) (HRT 10 h), the microaerobic process regained the
efficiency in nutrient removal with a removal of COD, NH4+ and TN averaged 59.0%,
95.3% and 87.8%, respectively. The microaerobic condition allowed anammox
bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and 
denitrifiers to all thrive in the UMBR, resulting in the efficient synchronous
removal of organic carbon and nitrogen. As the dominant approach to nitrogen
removal, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) pathway contributing to the TN
removal in the microaerobic process exceeded 59.5% at HLR 3.0 m3/(m3·d). The
results demonstrated that the UMBR can remove nitrogen and carbon from swine
wastewater, with a suitable HLR.
