BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a morbid and costly
complication in abdominal surgery. Topical antibiotic delivery via intraoperative
irrigation and barrier wound protection are strategies for preventing SSI. We
tested the safety and efficacy of a novel wound protector device with an
integrated fluid irrigation platform in a porcine model.
METHODS: A simulated colorectal resection model was designed and performed on
adult female pigs with a standardized concentration of 109 colony-forming units
(CFU) of Escherichia coli administered to the wound site in 10 mL of normal
saline (n = 7). The device was tested intraoperatively with and without
irrigation with gentamicin-containing irrigant solution. Swab and tissue samples 
were obtained in addition to peripheral blood samples. Quantitative culture
analysis was performed in addition to histological and immunohistochemical
analysis and gentamicin concentration measurements.
RESULTS: There were no adverse events observed in the animals. Tissue protected
by the device yielded exponentially lower levels of E. coli growth compared to
exposed tissue, with a mean 1 × 102 CFU/swab. Use of the device, both with and
without irrigation, was associated with an exponential reduction in quantitative 
bacterial load compared to the control wounds with no device, with limited growth
after wound closure in the pigs receiving irrigation. Histology and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining analysis
revealed no significant damage to tissue. Serum gentamicin levels remained below 
the clinical threshold and decreased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study suggests safety and efficacy of a novel device
for the prevention of intraoperative wound contamination.
