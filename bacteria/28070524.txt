Lipid-specific T cells comprise a group of T cells that recognize lipids bound to
the MHC class I-like CD1 molecules. There are four isoforms of CD1 that are
expressed at the surface of antigen presenting cells and therefore capable of
presenting lipid antigens: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d. Each one of these isoforms
has distinct structural features and cellular localizations, which promotes
binding to a broad range of different types of lipids. Lipid antigens originate
from either self-tissues or foreign sources, such as bacteria, fungus, or plants 
and their recognition by CD1-restricted T cells has important implications in
infection but also in cancer and autoimmunity. In this review, we describe the
characteristics of CD1 molecules and CD1-restricted lipid-specific T cells,
highlighting the innate-like and adaptive-like features of different
CD1-restricted T cell subtypes.
