Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) tonic signaling, defined as spontaneous
activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines by CAR-T cells, is considered
a negative attribute because it leads to impaired antitumor effects. Here, we
report that CAR tonic signaling is caused by the intrinsic instability of the mAb
single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to promote self-aggregation and signaling
via the CD3ζ chain incorporated into the CAR construct. This phenomenon was
detected in a CAR encoding either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory endodomains.
Instability of the scFv was caused by specific amino acids within the framework
regions (FWR) that can be identified by computational modeling. Substitutions of 
the amino acids causing instability, or humanization of the FWRs, corrected tonic
signaling of the CAR, without modifying antigen specificity, and enhanced the
antitumor effects of CAR-T cells. Overall, we demonstrated that tonic signaling
of CAR-T cells is determined by the molecular instability of the scFv and that
computational analyses of the scFv can be implemented to correct the scFv
instability in CAR-T cells with either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulation.
