Experiments were done in order to achieve a reproducible method that can be used 
to infect rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss with Flavobacterium psychrophilum,
the causal agent of coldwater disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome. The main
method investigated was intraperitoneal injection, and this method was tested
using isolates with different elastin-degrading profiles and representing
different serotypes. Injecting trout, average weight 1 g, with 10(4) CFU
(colony-forming units) per fish caused cumulative mortalities around 60 to 70%.
The virulent strains belonged to certain serotypes and degraded elastin. The
intraperitoneal injection challenge method could be used on larger fish, but the 
infection dose was 10(7) CFU per fish before mortalities occurred. Bath infection
and bath infection in combination with formalin treatment (stress) seemed to be
reproducible methods that could be used as alternatives to the intraperitoneal
method, although the mortalities among infected trout were lower. The results of 
investigated methods were influenced by parameters such as the challenge isolate,
number of fish in the tank affecting the infection pressure, origin of fish and
weight of fish.
