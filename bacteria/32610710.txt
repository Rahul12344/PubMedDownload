In this study we report the functional comparison of T cell receptor
(TCR)-engineered major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD4+
versus CD8+ T cells targeting a peptide from six transmembrane epithelial antigen
of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) in the context of HLA-A*02:01. STEAP1 is a
tumor-associated antigen, which is overexpressed in many cancers, including Ewing
sarcoma (EwS). Based on previous observations, we postulated strong antitumor
potential of tumor-redirected CD4+ T cells transduced with an HLA class
I-restricted TCR against a STEAP1-derived peptide. We compared CD4+ T cell
populations to their CD8+ counterparts in vitro using impedance-based xCELLigence
and cytokine/granzyme release assays. We further compared antitumor activity of
STEAP130-TCR transgenic (tg) CD4+ versus CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing
xenografted Rag2-/-gc-/- mice. TCR tgCD4+ T cells showed increased cytotoxic
features over time with similar functional avidity compared to tgCD8+ cells after
5-6 weeks of culture. In vivo, local tumor control was equal. Assessing
metastatic organotropism of intraveniously (i.v.) injected tumors, only tgCD8+
cells were associated with reduced metastases. In this analysis, EwS-redirected
tgCD4+ T cells contribute to local tumor control, but fail to control metastatic 
outgrowth in a model of xenografted EwS.
