OBJECTIVE: To determine whether laser light can improve healing of skin wounds by
killing wound bacteria while simultaneously accelerating host tissue activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wounds on the rat dorsum were irradiated or
sham-irradiated three times weekly from days 1 to 19 using 635 or 808 nm diode
lasers at 1 or 20 J/cm(2). Wound area and bacterial growth were evaluated three
times weekly. Histological analysis was performed on days 8 and 19.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on day 19.
RESULTS: Wounds that were irradiated using 635 nm light at 1 J/cm(2) healed
similarly to controls. Wounds that were irradiated using 808 nm (1 and 20
J/cm(2), P<or=0.05) and 635 nm light (20 J/cm(2), P<or=0.05) were worse in wound 
maximum area at day 3 compared with controls. Further, 635 nm light at 20 J/cm(2)
delayed wound closure at day 19 (ASL = 0.0127). Bacterial colonization of wounds 
was altered using 635 nm (20 J/cm(2), P<0.0001) and 808 nm light (1 J/cm(2),
P<0.0001; 20 J/cm(2), P = 0.02). In particular, the presence of normal skin flora
decreased (P<0.0001-0.0002) and, when using 808 nm light, the presence of S.
aureus increased (P = 0.0001). There was histological evidence of advanced repair
using 635 nm at 1 J/cm(2) at day 8 (ASL<0.04). In contrast, markers of acute
repair were increased and of late repair were decreased at day 19 using 635 nm at
20 J/cm(2) (ASL<0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that while clearing wounds of certain
bacteria is feasible it does not necessarily translate into a healing advantage. 
When normal flora are disturbed, environmental organisms more readily colonize
the wound surface. It is not clear when using 808 nm light whether the loss of
normal flora in the wound alone is responsible for the proliferation of S. aureus
or whether the light adds to the effect by stimulating S. aureus growth.
