Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (PCRT) and subsequent surgery is the standard
multimodal treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), albeit PCRT
response varies among the individuals. This creates a dire necessity to identify 
a predictive model to forecast treatment response outcomes and identify patients 
who would benefit from PCRT. In this study, we performed a gene expression study 
using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy samples from 156 LARC 
patients (training cohort n = 60; validation cohort n = 96); we identified the
nine-gene signature (FGFR3, GNA11, H3F3A, IL12A, IL1R1, IL2RB, NKD1, SGK2, and
SPRY2) that distinctively differentiated responders from non-responders in the
training cohort (accuracy = 86.9%, specificity = 84.8%, sensitivity = 81.5%) as
well as in an independent validation cohort (accuracy = 81.0%, specificity =
79.4%, sensitivity = 82.3%). The signature was independent of all pathological
and clinical features and was robust in predicting PCRT response. It is readily
applicable to the clinical setting using FFPE samples and Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved hardware and reagents. Predicting the response to
PCRT may aid in tailored therapies for respective responders to PCRT and improve 
the oncologic outcomes for LARC patients.
