Human FANCD2-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) is a DNA structure-specific nuclease
involved in the processing of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). FAN1 maintains
genomic stability and prevents tissue decline in multiple organs, yet it confers 
ICL-induced anti-cancer drug resistance in several cancer subtypes. Here we
report three crystal structures of human FAN1 in complex with a 5' flap DNA
substrate, showing that two FAN1 molecules form a head-to-tail dimer to locate
the lesion, orient the DNA and unwind a 5' flap for subsequent incision.
Biochemical experiments further validate our model for FAN1 action, as
structure-informed mutations that disrupt protein dimerization, substrate
orientation or flap unwinding impair the structure-specific nuclease activity.
Our work elucidates essential aspects of FAN1-DNA lesion recognition and a unique
mechanism of incision. These structural insights shed light on the cellular
mechanisms underlying organ degeneration protection and cancer drug resistance
mediated by FAN1.
