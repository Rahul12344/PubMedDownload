We cloned and sequenced the murC gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa encoding a
protein of 53 kDa. Multiple alignments with 20 MurC peptide sequences from
different bacteria confirmed the presence of highly conserved regions having
sequence identities ranging from 22-97% including conserved motifs for
ATP-binding and the active site of the enzyme. Genetic complementation was done
in Escherichia coli (murCts) suppressing the lethal phenotype. The murC gene was 
subcloned into the expression vector pET30a and overexpressed in E. coli
BL21(lambdaDE3). Three PCR cloning strategies were used to obtain the three
recombinant plasmids for expression of the native MurC, MurC His-tagged at
N-terminal and at C-terminal, respectively. MurC His-tagged at C-terminal was
chosen for large scale production and protein purification in the soluble form.
The purification was done in a single chromatographic step on an affinity nickel 
column and obtained in mg quantities at 95% homogeneity. MurC protein was used to
produce monoclonal antibodies for epitope mapping and for assay development in
high throughput screenings. Detailed studies of MurC and other genes of the
bacterial cell cycle will provide the reagents and strain constructs for high
throughput screening and for design of novel antibacterials.
