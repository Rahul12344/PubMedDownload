An immunogenic peptide (GP2) derived from HER-2/neu binds to HLA-A2.1 very
poorly. Some altered-peptide ligands (APL) of GP2 have increased binding affinity
and generate improved cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition of GP2-presenting tumor 
cells, but most do not. Increases in binding affinity of single-substitution APL 
are not additive in double-substitution APL. A common first assumption about
peptide binding to class I major histocompatibility complex is that each residue 
binds independently. In addition, immunologists interested in immunotherapy
frequently assume that anchor substitutions do not affect T cell receptor contact
residues. However, the crystal structures of two GP2 APL show that the central
residues change position depending on the identity of the anchor residue(s).
Thus, it is clear that subtle changes in the identity of anchor residues may have
significant effects on the positions of the T cell receptor contact residues.
