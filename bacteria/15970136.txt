Although the incidence of most central nervous system infections in HIV+ patients
has decreased after the introduction of the modern antiretroviral treatments,
they are still a major cause of morbidity and mortality. New technologies in
molecular biology and neuroradiology establish the diagnosis in many cases and
have decreased the need for cerebral biopsy. Prognosis has improved substantially
after the introduction of high activity antiretroviral treatment; more active
treatments are needed, however, for infections as PML or citomegalovirus
encephalitis because of their still unacceptably high mortality.
