The authors designed a new pad for urinary incontinence. It is composed of a
cloth of acrylonitrile copper sulfide and another cloth of iron-phthalocyanine.
In vitro experiments showed that acrylonitrile copper sulfide cloth inhibited the
growth of most bacteria causing urinary tract infection, and that
iron-phthalocyanine cloth effectively eliminated bad-smelling gases. The use of
this pad relieved diaper-dermatitis and diminished offensive smells from feces
and urine. This pad was well received by nurses and helpers taking care of
incontinent elderly people.
