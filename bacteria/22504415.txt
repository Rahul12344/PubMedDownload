BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis remains the single deadliest infectious
disease causing high mortality in humans leading to 1.4 million deaths annually. 
Inherited genetic factors may explain why some people resist infection more
successfully than others.
METHODS: The polymorphisms of HLA-class I (-A, -B) and class II (-DRB1, -DQB1)
genes have been evaluated using DNA-based typing in a population of 86
non-immunosuppressed, unrelated Greek patients with PTb and 46 healthy unrelated 
people without a history of PTb, who were all tested purified protein derivative 
positive (>14 mm).
RESULTS: The HLA-A R(114) and HLA-DRβN(37) residues are associated with
susceptibility. They operate independently from each other and their effect is
detected when the population is evaluated for their concurrent presence (A R(114)
positive or DRβN(37) positive or A R(114) and DRβN(37) positive). Furthermore the
HLA-A S(77) appears to have a protective role, however in the presence of the
DRβN(37), the A-S(77) does not exert its protective effect.
CONCLUSION: The HLA residues A-S(77), A-R(114) and DRβN(37) in combination with
PTb antigenic elements possibly modulate T-cell responses against MTb that lead
to either protection or susceptibility. The HLA-A and -DRB1-dependent T-cell
networks may interact among themselves and influence each other resulting in
different PTb phenotypes.
