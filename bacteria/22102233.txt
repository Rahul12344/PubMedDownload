A membrane-integrated Sec component, SecDF, associates with the SecYEG
protein-conducting channel and facilitates protein secretion and membrane-protein
integration. SecDF contains 12 transmembrane helices and two periplasmic domains.
The first periplasmic domain (P1) plays an important role in protein
translocation. Here, the overexpression, purification and crystallization of the 
P1 domain of Thermus thermophilus SecDF are reported. The crystals diffracted
X-rays to 2.3 Å resolution and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell
parameters a = 161.1, b = 35.8, c = 181.6 Å, suggesting that they contain four
molecules per asymmetric unit. The initial phases were determined by the
multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using selenomethionine-labelled
crystals.
