Background: Malaria is a major public health problem and life threatening
parasitic vector-borne disease. For the first time, we established and report the
molecular mechanism responsible for Anopheles gambiae s.l. resistance to
pyrethroids and DDT from Yamaltu Deba, Southern Guinea Savanna, Northern-Nigeria.
Methods: The susceptibility profile of An. gambiae s.l. to four insecticides (DDT
4%, bendiocarb 0.1%, malathion 5% and deltamethrin 0.05%) using 2-3 days old
females from larvae collected from study area between August and November, 2018
was first established. Genomic DNA was then extracted from 318 mosquitoes using
Livak DNA extraction protocol for specie identification and kdr genotyping. The
mosquitoes were identified to species level and then 96 genotyped for L1014F and 
L1014S kdr target site mutations.
Results: The mosquitoes were all resistant to DDT, bendiocarb and deltamethrin
but fully susceptible to malathion. An. coluzzii was found to be the dominant
sibling species (97.8%) followed by An. arabiensis (1.9%) and An. gambiae s.s
(0.3%). The frequency of the L1014F kdr mutation was relatively higher (83.3%)
than the L1014S (39%) in the three species studied. The L1014F showed a genotypic
frequency of 75% resistance (RR), 17% heterozygous (RS) and 8% susceptible (SS)
with an allelic frequency of 87% RR and 13% SS while the L1014S showed a
genotypic frequency of RR (16%), RS (38%) and SS (46%) with an allelic frequency 
of 40% RR and 60% SS, respectively.
Conclusion: This study reveals that both kdr mutations present simultaneously in 
Northern-Nigeria, however contribution of L1014F which is common in West Africa
was more than twice of L1014S mutation found in East Africa.
