Telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) is essential to the maintenance of
telomere chromatin structure and integrity. However, how telomere integrity is
maintained, especially in response to damage, remains poorly understood. Here, we
identify Nek7, a member of the Never in Mitosis Gene A (NIMA) kinase family, as a
regulator of telomere integrity. Nek7 is recruited to telomeres and stabilizes
TRF1 at telomeres after damage in an ATM activation-dependent manner. Nek7
deficiency leads to telomere aberrations, long-lasting γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, and 
augmented cell death upon oxidative telomeric DNA damage. Mechanistically, Nek7
interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 on Ser114, which prevents TRF1 from
binding to Fbx4, an Skp1-Cul1-F box E3 ligase subunit, thereby alleviating
proteasomal degradation of TRF1, leading to a stable association of TRF1 with
Tin2 to form a shelterin complex. Our data reveal a mechanism of efficient
protection of telomeres from damage through Nek7-dependent stabilization of TRF1.
