The bacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine ligase (MurC) from Escherichia coli, 
an essential, cytoplasmic peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme, catalyzes the
ATP-dependent ligation of L-alanine (Ala) and UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UNAM) to 
form UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine (UNAM-Ala). The phosphinate inhibitor 1 was
designed and prepared as a multisubstrate/transition state analogue. The compound
exhibits mixed-type inhibition with respect to all three enzyme substrates (ATP, 
UNAM, Ala), suggesting that this compound forms dead-end complexes with multiple 
enzyme states. Results from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies
supported these findings as exothermic binding was observed under conditions with
free enzyme (K(d) = 1.80-2.79 microM, 95% CI), enzyme saturated with ATP (K(d) = 
0.097-0.108 microM, 95% CI), and enzyme saturated with the reaction product ADP
(K(d) = 0.371-0.751 microM, 95% CI). Titrations run under conditions of
saturating UNAM or the product UNAM-Ala did not show heat effects consistent with
competitive compound binding to the active site. The potent binding affinity
observed in the presence of ATP is consistent with the inhibitor design and the
proposed Ordered Ter-Ter mechanism for this enzyme; however, the additional
binding pathways suggest that the inhibitor can also serve as a product analogue.
