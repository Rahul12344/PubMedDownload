SETDB1 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that has critical roles in cancers. 
However, its potential role in gastric cancer (GC) remains obscure. Here, we
mainly investigate the clinical significance and the possible role of SETDB1 in
GC. We find that SETDB1 expression is upregulated in GC tissues and its
high-level expression was a predictor of poor prognosis in patients.
Overexpression of SETDB1 promoted cell proliferation and metastasis, while SETDB1
suppression had an opposite effect both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically,
SETDB1 was shown to interact with ERG to promote the transcription of cyclin D1
(CCND1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) through binding to their promoter
regions. In addition, the expression of SETDB1 was also enhanced by the
transcription factor TCF4 at the transcriptional level in GC. Furthermore, SETDB1
expression was found to be induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection
in a TCF4-dependent manner. Taken together, our results indicate that SETDB1 is
aberrantly overexpressed in GC and plays key roles in gastric carcinogenesis and 
metastasis via upregulation of CCND1 and MMP9. Our work also suggests that SETDB1
could be a potential oncogenic factor and a therapeutic target for GC. © 2020 The
