OBJECTIVE: In the pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation,
dysfunctional natural anticoagulant pathways appear to play a pivotal role. In
this article, we will address the mechanisms that contribute to this defect in
the regulation of coagulation activation. Furthermore, we will explore the
experimental and clinical evidence that restoration of these anticoagulant
pathways results in clinical improvement.
DATA SOURCES: We have searched and reviewed published articles on experimental
studies of disseminated intravascular coagulation models in animals and clinical 
studies in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.
DATA SYNTHESIS: All three major anticoagulant pathways, that is, the antithrombin
pathway, the protein C system, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are defective
in sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Several mechanisms
contribute to this defect. Restoration of these pathways, in principle, by
administration of coagulation inhibitor concentrates or recombinant anticoagulant
factors, appears to ameliorate the coagulation disorder and, more important,
result in improvement of clinically relevant outcomes, such as a reduction of
organ failure and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of disrupted physiologic anticoagulant pathways in
disseminated intravascular coagulation is not only a logical point of impact in
patients with sepsis and an activated coagulation system, but also is associated 
with an improved outcome in experimental and (initial) clinical studies.
