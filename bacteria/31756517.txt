Mitochondrial LonP1 is an essential stress response protease that mediates
mitochondrial proteostasis, metabolism and bioenergetics. Homozygous and compound
heterozygous variants in the LONP1 gene encoding the LonP1 protease have recently
been shown to cause a diverse spectrum of human pathologies, ranging from
classical mitochondrial disease phenotypes, profound neurologic impairment and
multi-organ dysfunctions, some of which are uncommon to mitochondrial disorders. 
In this review, we focus primarily on human LonP1 and discuss findings, which
demonstrate its multidimensional roles in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis 
and adapting cells to metabolic flux and stress during normal physiology and
disease processes. We also discuss emerging roles of LonP1 in responding to
developmental, oncogenic and cardiac stress.
