Polyclonal antibodies have been raised in rabbits against the glycine receptor
antagonist strychnine, coupled through a 2-amino substituent to the antigenic
protein key-hole limpet haemocyanin. Strychnine binding of the predominantly
immunoglobulin G (IgG) class of antibodies was measured by incubation with
[3H]strychnine, followed by adsorption of IgG onto Staphylococcus aureus cells
and filtration through glass-fibre filters under vacuum. Only strychnine and
structurally related alkaloids or derivatives were able to inhibit [3H]strychnine
binding to the IgG. A significant rank correlation was found between the
potencies of these compounds to inhibit [3H]strychnine binding to the antibodies 
and to the glycine receptor in mouse spinal cord membranes. In contrast,
preincubation of strychnine antibodies with a variety of ligands at other
neurotransmitter, drug, or hormone receptors in the CNS (at 10(-4) M) failed to
inhibit binding significantly. The failure of glycine to inhibit strychnine
antibody binding is consistent with previous suggestions that the recognition
sites for this amino acid on the CNS receptor may be conformationally distinct
from those for the antagonist alkaloid. Strychnine antibodies may now help in the
identification and purification of possible endogenous ligands at this alkaloid
binding site in the CNS.
