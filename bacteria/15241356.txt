BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are potentially beneficial to maturation of the
infant's immune system.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of probiotic bacteria in treatment of cow's milk
allergy (CMA) and IgE-associated dermatitis, we investigated the immunologic
effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and a mixture of 4 bacterial species 
(MIX).
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study design, concomitantly with
elimination diet and skin treatment, LGG, MIX, or placebo was given for 4 weeks
to infants with suspected CMA. After anti-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-CD28 stimulation of
PBMCs, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-12 levels were measured in culture
supernatants by ELISA. Intracellular IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-5 production on CD4 
lymphocytes was analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
RESULTS: Secretion of IFN-gamma by PBMCs before the treatment was significantly
lower in infants with CMA (P=.016) and in infants with IgE-associated CMA
(P=.003) than in non-CMA infants. Among the infants who received LGG, the level
of secreted IFN-gamma increased in those with CMA (P=.006) and in those with
IgE-associated dermatitis (P=.017) when compared with the placebo group.
Secretion of IL-4 increased significantly in infants with CMA in the MIX (P=.034)
but not in the LGG group.
CONCLUSION: Deficiency in IFN-gamma response appears to be related to CMA. LGG
raises IFN-gamma production of PBMC in infants with CMA and in infants with
IgE-associated dermatitis and may thus provide beneficial TH1 immunomodulatory
signals. MIX, although containing LGG, appears to modulate the immune responses
differently.
