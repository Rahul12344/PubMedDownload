Gut bacteria are an important component of the microbiota ecosystem in the human 
gut, which is colonized by 1014 microbes, ten times more than the human cells.
Gut bacteria play an important role in human health, such as supplying essential 
nutrients, synthesizing vitamin K, aiding in the digestion of cellulose, and
promoting angiogenesis and enteric nerve function. However, they can also be
potentially harmful due to the change of their composition when the gut ecosystem
undergoes abnormal changes in the light of the use of antibiotics, illness,
stress, aging, bad dietary habits, and lifestyle. Dysbiosis of the gut bacteria
communities can cause many chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, 
obesity, cancer, and autism. This review summarizes and discusses the roles and
potential mechanisms of gut bacteria in human health and diseases.
