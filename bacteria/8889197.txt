The Escherichia coli chaperonins, GroEL and GroES, as well as their complexes in 
the presence of a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide AMP-PNP, have been imaged with the
atomic force microscope (AFM). We demonstrate that both GroEL and GroES that have
been adsorbed to a mica surface can be resolved directly by the AFM in aqueous
solution at room temperature. However, with glutaraldehyde fixation of already
adsorbed molecules, the resolution of both GroEL and GroES was further improved, 
as all seven subunits were well resolved without any image processing. We also
found that chemical fixation was necessary for the contact mode AFM to image
GroEL/ES complexes, and in the AFM images. GroEL with GroES bound can be clearly 
distinguished from those without. The GroEL/ES complex was about 5 nm higher than
GroEL alone, indicating a 2 nm upward movement of the apical domains of GroEL.
Using a slightly larger probe force, unfixed GroEL could be dissected: the upper 
heptamer was removed to expose the contact surface of the two heptamers. These
results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of cross-linking agents for the
determination of molecular structures with the AFM. They also pave the way for
using the AFM to study the structural basis for the function of GroE system and
other molecular chaperones.
