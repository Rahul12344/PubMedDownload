AIM: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients display dysfunctions in T cell
activation and anergy. Therefore the aims of our study were to explore the
expression of anergy-related factors in CD4+ T cells in relationship with
regulatory T cells (Tregs) frequency in SLE patients and to identify strategies
to redress these defects.
METHOD: Casitas B-cell lymphoma b (Cbl-b) and 'gene related to anergy in
lymphocytes' (GRAIL) proteins were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from SLE patients and healthy donors (HD) by immunoblotting. cbl-b,
grail, growth response factors (egr)2 and egr3 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were
evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in SLE and HD PBMCs and CD4+ T
cells. Phenotypic and functional characterization of CD4+ T cells was performed
by flow cytometry. Tregs expansion protocol consisted in culturing CD4+ T cells
for 14 or 21 days of experimental activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28
monoclonal antibodies, human recombinant interleukin (hrIL)-2, in the absence or 
presence of rapamycin (Rapa) or 1,25-(OH)2D3 (vitamin D: VitD).
RESULTS: SLE PBMCs expressed low levels of Cbl-b and GRAIL proteins. Both SLE
PBMCs and CD4+ T cells expressed low levels of egr2/3 mRNAs. SLE patients had a
reduced number of Tregs with impaired suppressive activity. An association
between egr2 mRNA level in CD4+ T cells and Tregs percentage was identified.
Experimental activation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of hrIL-2 and Rapa or
VitD induced the expansion of SLE Tregs. However, on long-term, only Rapa
exposure of SLE CD4+ T cells yielded high numbers of Tregs with sustained
suppressive activity.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a new strategy to correct defects in CD4+ T cell 
tolerance mechanisms that may prove beneficial in SLE.
