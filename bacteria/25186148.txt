Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) is a newly discovered
biological process that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) to nitrite
reduction. In this study, three different inocula, methanogenic sludge, paddy
soil, and freshwater sediment were used to enrich n-damo bacteria in three
sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), and three n-damo enrichment cultures, C1, C2
and C3, were obtained, respectively. After 500 days of incubation,
Methylomirabilis oxyfera-like bacteria and n-damo activities were observed in
cultures C1, C2, and C3, and the specific activities were 0.8 ± 0.1, 1.4 ± 0.1,
and 1.0 ± 0.1 μmol CH4 h(-1) g(-1) VSS, respectively. The copy numbers of 16S
rRNA genes from cultures C1, C2, and C3 were 5.0 ± 0.4 × 10(8), 6.1 ± 0.1 ×
10(9), and 1.0 ± 0.2 × 10(9) copies g(-1) dry weight, respectively. The results
indicated that paddy soil is an excellent inoculum for n-damo bacterial
enrichment. This work expanded the alternative source of n-damo inoculum and
benefited the further research of n-damo process.
