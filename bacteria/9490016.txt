Plasmid pLS32 is a relatively large (approximately 70 kbp), cryptic, low
copy-number plasmid present in Bacillus natto. We isolated and analyzed the
replication region of the plasmid in B. subtilis, and the following results were 
obtained: the replication region contained an open reading frame encoding a
287-amino acid protein (RepN), whose amino acid sequence was partially homologous
with those of the Rep proteins encoded on plasmids pAD1 and pLJ1 isolated from
Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus helveticus, respectively; the replication
origin (oriN) was located in the repN-coding region; the copy number of a pLS32
derivative, pBET131, was 2 to 3 per chromosome; replication of pBET131 required
poll. These features show that pLS32 is a novel plasmid capable of replication in
B. subtilis.
