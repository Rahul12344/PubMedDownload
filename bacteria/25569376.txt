Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells constitute an important subset of T cells
that can both directly and indirectly mediate anti-tumor immunity. However,
cancer patients have a reduction in both iNKT cell number and function, and these
deficits limit the potential clinical application of iNKT cells for cancer
therapy. To overcome the problem of limited iNKT cell numbers, we investigated
whether iNKT cells can be generated in vitro from bone marrow-derived adult
hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPC). Our data demonstrate that co-culture 
of HSPC with OP9-DL1 stromal cells, results in a functional CD3(+) T cell
population. These T cells can be further differentiated into iNKT cells by
secondary culture with CD1d-Ig-based artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC). 
Importantly, these in vitro-generated iNKT cells are functional, as demonstrated 
by their ability to proliferate and secrete IFN-γ and GM-CSF following
stimulation.
