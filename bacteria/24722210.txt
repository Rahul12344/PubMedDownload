Enhanced resistance to chemotherapy has been correlated with high levels of
Delta-Np73 (DNp73), an anti-apoptotic protein of the p53 tumor-suppressor family 
which inhibits the pro-apoptotic members such as p53 and TAp73. Although
genotoxic drugs have been shown to induce DNp73 degradation, lack of mechanistic 
understanding of this process precludes strategies to enhance the targeting of
DNp73 and improve treatment outcomes. Antizyme (Az) is a mediator of
ubiquitin-independent protein degradation regulated by the polyamine biosynthesis
pathway. We show here that acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAOX), a catabolic enzyme of 
this pathway, upregulates DNp73 levels by suppressing its degradation via the Az 
pathway. Conversely, downregulation of PAOX activity by siRNA-mediated knockdown 
or chemical inhibition leads to DNp73 degradation in an Az-dependent manner. PAOX
expression is suppressed by several genotoxic drugs, via selected members of the 
activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors, namely c-Jun, JunB and FosB,
which are required for stress-mediated DNp73 degradation. Finally, chemical- and 
siRNA-mediated inhibition of PAOX significantly reversed the resistant phenotype 
of DNp73-overexpressing cancer cells to genotoxic drugs. Together, these data
define a critical mechanism for the regulation of DNp73 abundance, and reveal
that inhibition of PAOX could widen the therapeutic index of cytotoxic drugs and 
overcome DNp73-mediated chemoresistance in tumors.
