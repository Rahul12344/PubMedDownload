Polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis was used to study polymorphism of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nucleoside phosphorylase (NSP), phosphoglucose
isomerase (PGI), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD), adenylate kinase (ADK) and 
esterases of 44 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 25 group G streptococcal
strains, 11 "S. equisimilis" strains, seven S. dysgalactiae strains, four S.
canis strains, three S. equi strains and seven S. zooepidemicus strains. Analysis
of LDH, NSP, PGI, HBD and ADK provided valuable interspecies differentiation, by 
showing that four groups of strains corresponded to the four known DNA homology
groups. Esterases showed greater intraspecies variation than the other enzymes.
The combined analysis of the six enzymes indicated 31 zymotypes among S.
pyogenes, 14 in group G streptococci and 11 in "S. equisimilis" strains. This was
shown to be an effective technique for typing pyogenic streptococci.
