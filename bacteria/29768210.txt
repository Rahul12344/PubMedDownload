Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has proven clinically beneficial
against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, 
suboptimal clinical outcomes have been associated with decreased expansion and
persistence of adoptively transferred CAR T cells, antigen-negative relapses, and
impairment by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Improvements in CAR
T cell design are required to enhance clinical efficacy, as well as broaden the
applicability of this technology. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-18
(IL-18)-secreting CAR T cells exhibit enhanced in vivo expansion and persistence 
and significantly increase long-term survival in syngeneic mouse models of both
hematological and solid malignancies. In addition, we demonstrate that
IL-18-secreting CAR T cells are capable of modulating the tumor microenvironment,
as well as enhancing an effective endogenous anti-tumor immune response.
IL-18-secreting CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to enhance the
clinical outcomes of adoptive T cell therapy.
