Uterine NK (uNK) cells express a unique set of markers compared with blood NK
cells. However, recent studies suggest that uNK cells may be derived from the
recruitment of blood NK cells into the endometrium. In this study, we used an in 
vitro organ culture system to demonstrate that estradiol induces expression of
chemokines CXCL10 and/or CXCL11 within human endometrium in 85% of patient
samples tested. The average increase in gene expression after 10(-9) M estradiol 
treatment was 8.5-fold for CXCL10 and 7.7-fold for CXCL11 compared with medium
alone. We observed that a specific estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI182780) was
able to prevent chemokine gene induction, indicating that the effect of estradiol
was receptor mediated. Moreover, our study showed that progesterone induced
CXCL10 and CXCL11 expression in 83% of endometrial samples tested. We have also
found that uNK cells and blood NK cells express the receptor for CXCL10 and
CXCL11, CXCR3, with the highest expression found on uNK cells and CD56(bright)
blood NK cells. These data indicate that sex hormones induce specific chemokines 
in nonpregnant human endometrium that can activate NK cell migration, and suggest
that this mechanism may account for the increased NK cell numbers in endometrium 
during the menstrual cycle.
