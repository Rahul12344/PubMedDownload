R-loops, nucleic acid structures consisting of an RNA-DNA hybrid and displaced
single-stranded (ss) DNA, are ubiquitous in organisms from bacteria to mammals.
First described in bacteria where they initiate DNA replication, it now appears
that R-loops regulate diverse cellular processes such as gene expression,
immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching, and DNA repair. Changes in R-loop regulation
induce DNA damage and genome instability, and recently it was shown that R-loops 
are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. We discuss recent developments
in the field; in particular, the regulation and effects of R-loops in cells,
their effect on genomic and epigenomic stability, and their potential
contribution to the origin of diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative
disorders.
