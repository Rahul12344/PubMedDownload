Fyn-related kinase (Frk) was first identified using human breast cancer cells. It
shares 51% identity with c-Src. Like all members of the Src family, Frk is
thought to cause several cancers via dysregulations in signal transduction from
cell-surface receptors. The excess activity of Frk on beta-cells has a crucial
role in type-I diabetes. A silent mutation at Ile229 conferred a bacterial
expression system on the kinase domains of Frk, which allowed for the quick
expression and purification of one unphosphorylated and two mono-phosphorylated
kinase domains. The C-terminal catalytic segment of the human Frk kinase
conjugating hexahistidine purification tag (His-tag) was expressed in Escherichia
coli. After first-step purification utilizing the His-tag, an anion-exchange
chromatogram yielded three major peaks that had distinguishable phosphorylation
characteristics as judged by Western blot analysis and measurement of kinase
activity. This result of active protein production should promote drug discovery 
studies, including highthrough-put screening and structure-based drug design.
