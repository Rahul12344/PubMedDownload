The human CD8 functions as a co-receptor for specific T cell recognition, and
only one complex structure of human CD8αα binding to HLA-A*0201 has been solved, 
revealing the molecular basis of CD8 interacting with its ligand pHLA. Here, we
present the complex structures of human CD8αα bound to HLA-A*2402, which
demonstrate two opposite α3 domain CD loop shifts (either pull or push) in the
HLA heavy chain upon CD8 engagement. Taking the previously reported mouse
CD8-pMHC complex structures into account, from the structural view, all of the
data indicate the plasticity of CD8 binding to pMHC/HLA, which facilitates its
co-receptor function for T cells. The plasticity of CD8 binding appears not to
affect the specificity of TCR recognition, as no peptide conformation change
extends to the pMHC interface for TCR contacting.
