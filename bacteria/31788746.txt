The current problem of increasing antibiotic resistance and the resurgence of
numerous infections indicate the need for novel vaccination strategies more than 
ever. In vaccine development, the search for and the selection of adequate
vaccine antigens is the first important step. In recent years, bacterial outer
membrane proteins have become of major interest, as they are the main proteins
interacting with the extracellular environment. Trimeric autotransporter adhesins
(TAAs) are important virulence factors in many Gram-negative bacteria, are
localised on the bacterial surface, and mediate the first adherence to host cells
in the course of infection. One example is the Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), which 
is currently used as a subunit in a licensed vaccine against Neisseria
meningitidis. Other TAAs that seem promising vaccine candidates are the
Acinetobacter trimeric autotransporter (Ata), the Haemophilus influenzae adhesin 
(Hia), and TAAs of the genus Bartonella. Here, we review the suitability of
various TAAs as vaccine candidates.
