The pancreas contains both exocrine and endocrine cells, but the molecular
mechanisms controlling the differentiation of these cell types are largely
unknown. Despite their endodermal origin, pancreatic endocrine cells share
several molecular characteristics with neurons, and, like neurons in the central 
nervous system, differentiating endocrine cells in the pancreas appear in a
scattered fashion within a field of progenitor cells. This indicates that they
may be generated by lateral specification through Notch signalling. Here, to test
this idea, we analysed pancreas development in mice genetically altered at
several steps in the Notch signalling pathway. Mice deficient for Delta-like gene
1 (Dll1) or the intracellular mediator RBP-Jkappa showed accelerated
differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells. A similar phenotype was observed
in mice over-expressing neurogenin 3 (ngn 3) or the intracellular form of Notch3 
(a repressor of Notch signalling). These data provide evidence that ngn3 acts as 
proendocrine gene and that Notch signalling is critical for the decision between 
the endocrine and progenitor/exocrine fates in the developing pancreas.
