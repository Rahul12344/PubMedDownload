Scrub typhus is zoonotic disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (O
tsutsugamushi). It is transmitted to humans by the bite of trombiculid mite
larvae (chiggers). It is a re-emerging infectious disease in India. Clinical
manifestations include fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, eschar, adenopathy and
maculopapular rash. Complications of Scrub typhus develop after first week of
illness. Complications include meningoencephalitis, jaundice, myocarditis, ARDS
and renal failure. Eschar and rash may be unnoticed or absent. Thorough physical 
examination, identification of eschar/rash throws light in thinking about scrub
typhus, treating and preventing further complications. Here, we report a case of 
scrub typhus with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and its management
with non invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit.
