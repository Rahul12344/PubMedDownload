The raw sewage samples of the investigated municipal sewage plant (sewage flow of
about 30,000 m3/d) contained about 10(3) campylobacters/100 ml. The sewage plant 
reduced 80.8% of organic wastes (COD), 85.0% of colony counts (20 degrees C),
92.5% of total coliforms and 88.0% of campylobacters. The sewage plant effluent
contained an average of 1.3 X 10(2) campylobacters/100 ml. About 10(10)
campylobacters are discharged with the effluent of the high-output sewage plant
into the receiving water every day. No reduction of the indicator bacteria was
found in the activated sludge tank, there was, however, a significant reduction
(94.5%) of campylobacters. In total, 94 strains were differentiated by biotyping 
and serotyping. 59.6% were found to be Campylobacter jejuni and 40.4% were
Campylobacter coli. 8 Serotypes were found among the C. jejuni strains and 12
among C. coli. The raw sewage of the investigated oxidation pond treatment plant 
contained an average of 51 campylobacters/100 ml. The sewage plant effluent did
not show campylobacters in any case.
