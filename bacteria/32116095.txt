Coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of the zoonosis Q fever, replicates
inside host cells within a large vacuole displaying autolysosomal
characteristics. The development of this compartment is mediated by bacterial
effectors, which interfere with a number of host membrane trafficking pathways.
By screening a Coxiella transposon mutant library, we observed that transposon
insertions in cbu0626 led to intracellular replication and vacuole biogenesis
defects. Here, we demonstrate that CBU0626 is a novel member of the Coxiella
vacuolar protein (Cvp) family of effector proteins, which is translocated by the 
Dot/Icm secretion system and localizes to vesicles with autolysosomal features as
well as Coxiella-containing vacuoles (CCVs). We thus renamed this effector CvpF
for Coxiella vacuolar protein F. CvpF specifically interacts with the host small 
GTPase RAB26, leading to the recruitment of the autophagosomal marker
MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) to CCVs.
Importantly, cvpF::Tn mutants were highly attenuated compared to wild-type
bacteria in the SCID mouse model of infection, highlighting the importance of
CvpF for Coxiella virulence. These results suggest that CvpF manipulates
endosomal trafficking and macroautophagy/autophagy induction for optimal C.
