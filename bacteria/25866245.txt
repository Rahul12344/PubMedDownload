PTEN is proposed to function at the plasma membrane, where receptor tyrosine
kinases are activated. However, the majority of PTEN is located throughout the
cytoplasm. Here, we show that cytoplasmic PTEN is distributed along microtubules,
tethered to vesicles via phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), the signature
lipid of endosomes. We demonstrate that the non-catalytic C2 domain of PTEN
specifically binds PI(3)P through the CBR3 loop. Mutations render this loop
incapable of PI(3)P binding and abrogate PTEN-mediated inhibition of PI
3-kinase/AKT signaling. This loss of function is rescued by fusion of the loop
mutant PTEN to FYVE, the canonical PI(3)P binding domain, demonstrating the
functional importance of targeting PTEN to endosomal membranes. Beyond revealing 
an upstream activation mechanism of PTEN, our data introduce the concept of PI
3-kinase signal activation on the vast plasma membrane that is contrasted by
PTEN-mediated signal termination on the small, discrete surfaces of internalized 
vesicles.
