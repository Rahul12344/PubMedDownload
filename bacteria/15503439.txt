Organic layers of salivary biopolymers adsorbed on soft and hard oral tissues,
referred to also as salivary pellicle, play a critical role with respect to all
surface phenomena taking place in the oral cavity. The initial stages of pellicle
formation are of great interest since they determine the ensuing processes of
salivary biopolymer adsorption and subsequent adherence of bacteria. In spite of 
the important physiological role of the pellicle in protecting the enamel surface
against short-term acidic attacks, the composition and ultrastructure of the
pellicle layer are not yet understood and resolved in detail. The present study
utilized atomic force microscopy (AFM), for the first time, to elucidate the
morphogenesis and ultrastructural pattern of initial salivary pellicle formation 
taking place in situ on solid substrates of mica, silicon wafer and graphite.
Using tapping mode AFM, salivary pellicles were found in all intraorally exposed 
specimens and revealed a globular surface morphology of the adsorbed protein
layer. The average diameter and height of the adsorbed salivary proteins were
determined to be 15 +/- 3 nm and 2.0 +/- 0.5 nm, respectively. It was also found 
that the surface energy of the substrates affects the rate of pellicle formation,
while the overall size of the adsorbed salivary proteins appears to be identical 
on all studied substrates.
