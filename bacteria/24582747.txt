Autophagy is a unique intracellular protein degradation system accompanied by
autophagosome formation. Besides its important role through bulk degradation in
supplying nutrients, this system has an ability to degrade certain proteins,
organelles, and invading bacteria selectively to maintain cellular homeostasis.
In yeasts, Atg8p plays key roles in both autophagosome formation and selective
autophagy based on its membrane fusion property and interaction with autophagy
adaptors/specific substrates. In contrast to the single Atg8p in yeast, mammals
have 6 homologs of Atg8p comprising LC3 and GABARAP families. However, it is not 
clear these two families have different or similar functions. The aim of this
study was to determine the separate roles of LC3 and GABARAP families in
basal/constitutive and/or selective autophagy. While the combined knockdown of
LC3 and GABARAP families caused a defect in long-lived protein degradation
through lysosomes, knockdown of each had no effect on the degradation. Meanwhile,
knockdown of LC3B but not GABARAPs resulted in significant accumulation of
p62/Sqstm1, one of the selective substrate for autophagy. Our results suggest
that while mammalian Atg8 homologs are functionally redundant with regard to
autophagosome formation, selective autophagy is regulated by specific Atg8
homologs.
