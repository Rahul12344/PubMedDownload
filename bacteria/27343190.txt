Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative pathogen in
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Granzyme A (GzmA) is a serine protease
produced by a variety of cell types involved in the immune response. We sought to
determine the role of GzmA on the host response during pneumococcal pneumonia.
GzmA was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) harvested from CAP
patients from the infected and contralateral uninfected side and in lung tissue
slides from CAP patients and controls. In CAP patients, GzmA levels were
increased in BALF obtained from the infected lung. Human lungs showed
constitutive GzmA expression by both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells. In an 
experimental setting, pneumonia was induced in wild-type (WT) and GzmA-deficient 
(GzmA(-/-)) mice by intranasal inoculation of S. pneumoniae In separate
experiments, WT and GzmA(-/-) mice were treated with natural killer (NK) cell
depleting antibodies. Upon infection with S. pneumoniae, GzmA(-/-) mice showed a 
better survival and lower bacterial counts in BALF and distant body sites
compared with WT mice. Although NK cells showed strong GzmA expression, NK cell
depletion did not influence bacterial loads in either WT or GzmA(-/-) mice. These
results implicate that GzmA plays an unfavorable role in host defense during
pneumococcal pneumonia by a mechanism that does not depend on NK cells.
