Oral malodor, also known as bad breath or halitosis, is an extremely common
problem. Bad breath can arise from many sources in the body, but most frequently 
is produced in the mouth by the action of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria on
sulfur-containing proteinaceous substrates in the saliva, such as debris and
plaque. The primary molecules responsible for oral malodor are volatile sulfur
compounds (VSC), such as hydrogen sulfide and methylmercaptan. Increased malodor 
production is related to greater bacterial numbers, reducing conditions,
availability of protein substrates, and a pH above neutral. Bad breath is more
common in the elderly, as well as those with unhygienic mouths, gingivitis, and
periodontitis, but bad breath can also be found in some individuals who are
periodontally healthy. The major source of oral malodor is the tongue. Approaches
to controlling malodor have included masking, oral hygiene, antibacterial agents,
conversion of VSC to nonodorous forms, oxidizing agents, and traditional
approaches, including the use of baking soda. Results of controlled double-blind 
crossover studies, using both organoleptic (sensory) and gas chromatographic
analysis of mouth air VSC, indicate that two dentifrices with high baking-soda
concentrations, Arm & Hammer Dental Care and Arm & Hammer PeroxiCare, reduce oral
malodor.
