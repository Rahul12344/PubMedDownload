The collection of biological wastes in separate bio-containers can lead to a
favoured development of thermophilic and thermotolerant moulds, especially of
mucoraceous species and aspergilli, among which the human pathogen A. fumigatus
is especially frequent. The abundantly produced spores are released into the air 
and can evoke severe infections in persons with immune-deficiencies. In two
series of experiments it was demonstrated that the following procedures can
reduce the number of spores in the air in the bio-containers above the biological
wastes: (1) wrapping the wastes in portions in newsprint: the number of
colony-forming units (CFU) decreases for about 50-70%; (2) cleaning of the
container after each emptying with diluted vinegar: the number of CFU is reduced 
for up to 80%; (3) placing the container at shady sites: the temperature of the
air inside the bio-containers at shady sites is approximately 5-8 degrees C lower
than at sunny places with the consequence that the number of CFU in the air above
the biological wastes is decreased. Based on these results principles for the
handling of biological wastes are set up.
