Breast cancer is characterized into different molecular subtypes, and each
subtype is characterized by differential gene expression that are associated with
distinct survival outcomes in patients. PIK3CA mutations are commonly associated 
with most breast cancer subtypes. More recently PIK3CA mutations have been shown 
to induce tumor heterogeneity and are associated with activation of
EGFR-signaling and reduced relapse free survival in basal subtype of breast
cancer. Thus, understanding what determines PIK3CA induced heterogeneity and
oncogenesis, is an important area of investigation. In this study, we assessed
the effect of mutant PIK3CA together with mutant Ras plus mutant p53 on oncogenic
behavior of two distinct stem/progenitor breast cell lines, designated as
K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+. Constructs were ectopically overexpressed in K5+/K19- and 
K5+/K19+ stem/progenitor cells, followed by various in-vitro and in-vivo
analyses. Oncogene combination m-Ras/m-p53/m-PIK3CA efficiently transformed both 
K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+ cell lines in-vitro, as assessed by anchorage-independent
soft agar colony formation assay. Significantly, while this oncogene combination 
induced a complete epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in K5+/K19- cell
line, mostly epithelial phenotype with minor EMT component was seen in K5+/K19+
cell line. However, both K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+ transformed cells exhibited
increased invasion and migration abilities. Analyses of CD44 and CD24 expression 
showed both cell lines had tumor-initiating CD44+/CD24low cell population,
however transformed K5+/K19- cells had more proportion of these cells.
Significantly, both cell types exhibited in-vivo tumorigenesis, and maintained
their EMT and epithelial nature in-vivo in mice tumors. Notably, while both cell 
types exhibited increase in tumor-initiating cell population, differential EMT
phenotype was observed in these cell lines. These results suggest that EMT is a
cell type dependent phenomenon and does not dictate oncogenesis.
