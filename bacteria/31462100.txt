Potential applications of gold nanoparticles in biomedicine have increasingly
been reported on account of the ease of synthesis, bioinert characteristics,
optical properties, chemical stability, high biocompatibility, and specificity.
The safety of these particles remains a great concern, as there are differences
among toxicity study protocols used. This article focuses on integrating results 
of research on the toxicological behavior of gold nanoparticles. This can be
influenced by the physicochemical properties, including size, shape, surface
charge, and other factors, such as methods used in the synthesis of gold
nanoparticles, models used, dose, in vivo route of administration, and
interference of gold nanoparticles with in vitro toxicity assay systems. Several 
researchers have reported toxicological studies with regard to gold
nanoparticles, using various in vitro, in vivo, and in ovo models. The
conflicting results concerning the toxicity of gold nanoparticles should thus be 
addressed to justify the safe use of gold nanoparticles in biomedicine.
