Clofazimine (CLZ) is an effective antibiotic used against a wide spectrum of
Gram-positive bacteria and leprosy. One of its main drawbacks is its poor
solubility in water. Silica based materials are used as drug delivery carriers
that can increase the solubility of different hydrophobic drugs. Here, we studied
how the properties of the silica framework of the mesoporous materials SBA-15,
MCM-41, Al-MCM-41, and zeolites NaX, NaY, and HY affect the loading, stability,
and distribution of encapsulated CLZ. Time-correlated single-photon counting
(TCSPC) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) experiments show the 
presence of neutral and protonated CLZ (1.3-3.8 ns) and weakly interacting
aggregates (0.4-0.9 ns), along with H- and J-type aggregates (<0.1 ns). For the
mesoporous and HY zeolite composites, the relative contribution to the overall
emission spectra from H-type aggregates is low (<10%), while for the J-type
aggregates it becomes higher (~30%). For NaX and NaY the former increased whereas
the latter decreased. Although the CLZ@mesoporous composites show higher loading 
compared to the CLZ@zeolites ones, the behavior of CLZ is not uniform and its
dynamics are more heterogeneous across different single mesoporous particles.
These results may have implication in the design of silica-based drug carriers
for better loading and release mechanisms of hydrophobic drugs.
