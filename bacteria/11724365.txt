Six new phenol (anthraquinone or stilbene) glycosides with an acyl group at
6-position of the glucopyranose moiety were isolated from rhubarb (the roots of
Rheum palmatum) cultivated in Japan, together with 22 known compounds. Most of
these compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against tumor and normal
cells and for induction of DNA damage by spore rec-assay. Among them, emodin and 
aloe-emodin showed higher cytotoxic activities against human oral squamous cell
carcinoma (HSC-2) and salivary gland tumor (HSG) cell lines than against normal
human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Chrysophanol
8-O-beta-(6'-acetyl)glucopyranoside, 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone
4'-O-beta-D-(2"-O-galloyl-6"-O-cinnamoyl) glucopyranoside, and
6"-O-(4'''-hydroxybenzoyl) resveratroloside exhibited relatively higher cytotoxic
activities against all these cells. The other glycosides of anthraquinone or
stilbene showed weaker cytotoxic activity against these tumor cell lines, but may
be considered as cancer chemopreventive agents. Spore rec-assay with a
recombination deficient mutant of Bacillus subtilis M45 demonstrated the DNA
damage-inducing activity of emodin and aloe-emodin 15-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside
among, rhubarb phenols.
