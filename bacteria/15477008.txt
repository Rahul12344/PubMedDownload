The existence of mucus plugs, containing mucins, bacteria, and neutrophils,
blocking the lower airways in the lung of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has
raised the possibility that production of "abnormal" mucins is a critical
characteristic of this disease. The molecular nature, if any, of this abnormality
is unknown. Recent studies suggest that CF lung disease progression is
characterized by an early phase in which airway surface liquid (ASL) increased
dehydration is accompanied by altered pH and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH).
In a later phase, bacterial infection and neutrophil invasion lead to increased
ASL of concentrations myeloperoxidase and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Independent
studies indicate that gel-forming mucins, the key components of airway mucus,
form disulfide-linked polymers through a pH-dependent, likely self-catalyzed
mechanism. In this article, we present the hypothesis that increased mucus
concentration (dehydration) and altered pH, and levels of GSH, myeloperoxidase,
and/or HOCl result in the extracellular formation of additional interchain bonds 
among airway mucins. These novel interactions would create an atypical mucin
network with abnormal viscoelastic and adhesive properties.
