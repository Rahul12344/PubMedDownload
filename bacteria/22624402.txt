In order to explore the microscopic degradation mechanism of organic pesticides
degrading enzymes, we used molecular docking method to investigate the binding
modes of DDT to laccase and chlorpyrifos to organophosphorus hydrolase, and
obtained the corresponding complex structures. According to the principle of
minimum scoring, the results showed that the MolDock scores were -103.134 and
-111.626, re-rank scores were -72.858 and -80.261, respectively. And we used
LPC/CSU server search the interactions between organic pesticides and their
degrading enzymes. Our results showed that hydrophobic interaction was the
strongest contacts in DDT-laccase complex, and both hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions were the strongest contacts when
chlorpyrifos-organophosphorus hydrolase complex. The amino acid residues Tyr224
in laccase and Arg254 in organophosphorus hydrolase were detected to play
significant roles in catalytic processes.
