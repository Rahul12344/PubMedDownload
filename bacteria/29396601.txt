DNA repair is essential to maintain genome integrity. In addition to various DNA 
repair pathways dealing with specific types of DNA lesions, DNA damage tolerance 
(DDT) promotes the bypass of DNA replication blocks encountered by the
replication fork to prevent cell death. Budding yeast Rad5 plays an essential
role in the DDT pathway and its structure indicates that Rad5 recognizes damaged 
DNA or stalled replication forks, suggesting that Rad5 plays an important role in
the DDT pathway choice. It has been reported that Rad5 forms subnuclear foci in
the presence of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) during the S phase. By analyzing
the formation of Rad5 foci after MMS treatment, we showed that some specific DNA 
structures rather than mono-ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
are required for the recruitment of Rad5 to the damaged site. Moreover,
inactivation of the base excision repair (BER) pathway greatly decreased the Rad5
focus formation, suggesting that Rad5 recognizes specific DNA structures
generated by BER. We also identified a negative role of overexpressed translesion
synthesis polymerase PolÎ· in the formation of Rad5 foci. Based on these data, we 
propose a modified DDT pathway model in which Rad5 plays a role in activating the
DDT pathway.
