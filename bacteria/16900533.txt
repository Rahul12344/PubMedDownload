BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been recognized that inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) produce important endogenous factors
of human tumors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins, which is involved
in the process of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. This study aimed to
evaluate the association of clinicopathologic factors, microvessel density, and
patient survival with the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in patients with gastric
adenocarcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine specimens, resected from patients with
gastric adenocarcinoma, were investigated by immunohistochemical stain against
iNOS and COX-2. Microvessels were stained using anti-CD34 antibody and counted as
microvessel density.
RESULTS: Positive iNOS and COX-2 expressions were significantly correlated with
microvessel density by multivariate analysis, respectively (P = 0.0127 vs. P =
0.0214). There was significant difference among the four groups (both iNOS and
COX-2 positive, iNOS positive only, COX-2 positive only, and both negative) in
serosal invasion (P = 0.038), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.038), Helicobacter
pylori infection (P = 0.025), vascular invasion (P = 0.035), and microvessel
density (P = 0.019). In patients with gastric cancer that co-expressed iNOS and
COX-2, prognosis was significantly poorer than in those that expressed either
iNOS or COX-2, or did not express both of them (P = 0.01738). The Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that iNOS expression, vascular 
invasion, serosal invasion, and microvessel density are independent prognostic
factors for patients with gastric cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: iNOS and COX-2 expression of gastric cancer are related to tumor
angiogenesis, tumor progression, and patient survival in human gastric cancer.
