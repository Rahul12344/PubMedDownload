BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of
cancer-related death that develops as a consequence of obesity, cirrhosis, and
chronic hepatitis. However, the pathways along which these changes occur remain
incompletely understood.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this study, we show that the deubiquitinase USP30 is
abundant in HCCs that arise in mice maintained on high-fat diets. IKKβ
phosphorylated and stabilized USP30, which promoted USP30 to deubiquitinate ATP
citrate lyase (ACLY) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). IKKβ also directly
phosphorylated ACLY and facilitated the interaction between USP30 and ACLY and
the latter's deubiquitination. In HCCs arising in DEN/CCl4 -treated mice, USP30
deletion attenuated lipogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis regardless of
diet. The combination of ACLY inhibitor and programmed death ligand 1 antibody
largely suppressed chemical-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The IKKβ-USP30-ACLY
axis was also found to be up-regulated in human HCCs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies an IKKβ-USP30-ACLY axis that plays an
essential and wide-spread role in tumor metabolism and may be a potential
therapeutic target in HCC.
