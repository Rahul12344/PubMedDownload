The development of CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a
population that is critical for both innate and adaptive immunity, is regulated
by multiple transcription factors, but the molecular mechanisms underlying how
the transcriptional activation of these factors are regulated during iNKT
development remain largely unknown. We found that the histone acetyltransferase
general control non-derepressible 5 (GCN5) is essential for iNKT cell development
during the maturation stage. GCN5 deficiency blocked iNKT cell development in a
cell-intrinsic manner. At the molecular level, GCN5 is a specific lysine
acetyltransferase of early growth responsive gene 2 (EGR2), a transcription
factor required for iNKT cell development. GCN5-mediated acetylation positively
regulated EGR2 transcriptional activity, and both genetic and pharmacological
GCN5 suppression specifically inhibited the transcription of EGR2 target genes in
iNKT cells, including Runx1, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF),
interleukin (IL)-2Rb, and T-bet. Therefore, our study revealed GCN5-mediated EGR2
acetylation as a molecular mechanism that regulates iNKT development.
