PURPOSE: Immunotherapy with antibodies against B7/CD28 family members, including 
PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 has shifted the treatment paradigm for non-small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with improved clinical outcome. HHLA2 is a newly
discovered member of the family. By regulating T-cell function, HHLA2 could
contribute to tumor immune suppression and thus be a novel target for cancer
immunotherapy. There is limited information and critical need to characterize its
expression profile and clinical significance in NSCLC.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed IHC with an HHLA2-specific antibody (clone
566.1) using tissue microarrays constructed from 679 NSCLC tumor tissues,
including 392 cases in the discovery set and 287 cases in the validation cohort. 
We also studied clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients.
RESULTS: Overall, HHLA2 was not detected in most of normal lung tissue but
expressed in 66% of NSCLC across different subtypes. In particular, EGFR-mutated 
NSCLC was significantly associated with higher tumor HHLA2 expression in both
discovery (EGFR vs. WT: 76% vs. 53%, P = 0.01) and validation cohorts (89% vs.
69%, P = 0.01). In one of the two cohorts, HHLA2 expression was higher in lung
adenocarcinoma as compared with squamous and large cell histology, non-Hispanic
White versus Hispanics, and tumors with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 
density. In the multivariate analysis, EGFR mutation status and high TIL
intensity were independently associated with HHLA2 expression in lung
adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: HHLA2 is widely expressed in NSCLC and is associated with EGFR
mutation and high TILs in lung adenocarcinoma. It is potentially a novel target
for lung cancer immunotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 825-32. ©2016 AACR.
