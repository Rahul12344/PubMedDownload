The infectious burden leading to immune activation can vary between different
populations and lead to various immune dysfunctions. We compared the effect of
immune activation on apoptosis and T cell function in HIV uninfected individuals 
from Nairobi, Kenya (n=34), and Winnipeg, Canada (n=10). Women from Nairobi had a
significantly greater number of CD8+ T cells expressing the activation markers
CD38 and HLA DR. Kenyan women also had significantly higher levels of CTLA-4+ CD4
and CD8+ T cells, and reduced levels of CD28+ CD8+ cells. Levels of CD95+ CD4+ T 
cells were higher in Kenyan women and, correspondingly, showed higher levels of
spontaneous apoptosis. Kenyan women also demonstrated hyper-responsiveness to T
cell activation as assessed by interferon gamma production. This study
demonstrates that in a population of Kenyan women with high levels of T cell
activation, there were also elevated levels of T cell apoptotic death and
hyper-responsiveness. These differences may influence the efficacy of immune
responses to pathogens and must be considered when testing candidate vaccines.
