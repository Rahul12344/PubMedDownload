Murine homologs of the PDGF A, PDGF B, and PDGF receptor alpha subunit genes were
cloned. These were used, together with a mouse PDGF receptor beta subunit cDNA
clone, to monitor gene expression in early postimplantation mouse embryos and in 
F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. RNAse protection analysis shows that PDGF A chain, 
but not B chain, mRNA is expressed in 6.5- to 8.5-day embryonic and
extraembryonic tissues. Both alpha and beta receptor subunit mRNAs are expressed 
in early embryos, however, alpha subunit mRNA appears earlier and is more
abundant than beta subunit mRNA. Undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma stem
cells express abundant levels of A chain, but not B chain, mRNA. Neither of the
PDGF receptor genes is expressed in stem cells. Treatment with retinoic acid
stimulates expression of both PDGF receptor genes. As in postimplantation mouse
embryos, alpha receptor subunit mRNA appears earlier and is substantially more
abundant than beta subunit mRNA. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the
genes encoding the two chains of PDGF and their receptors are regulated
independently during development and suggest that the two systems have some
nonoverlapping functions in vivo. PDGF A, but not PDGF B, may be particularly
important in modulating early events in mouse embryonic development.
