Paratuberculosis is a chronic intestinal disease of ruminant animals caused by
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). A hallmark of paratuberculosis
is a transition from a cell-mediated Th1 type response to a humoral Th2 response 
with the progression of disease from a subclinical to clinical state. The
objective of this study was to investigate the expression of two crucial
molecules in T cell function, ZAP-70 (zeta-chain-associated protein of 70 kDa)
and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4), in cows naturally infected with
MAP. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from control
non-infected cows (n=5), and cows in subclinical (n=6) and clinical stages of
paratuberculosis (n=6) were cultured alone (medium only), and with concanavalin
A, and a whole cell sonicate of MAP for 24, 72 and 144 h to measure the dynamic
changes of ZAP-70 and CTLA-4 expression on CD4, CD8, and gamma delta (γδ) T
cells. Flow cytometry was also performed to measure ZAP-70 phosphorylation to
examine proximal T cell receptor signaling in animals of different disease
status. The surface expression of CTLA-4 was increased in animals in subclinical 
stage of infection while levels of ZAP-70 were decreased in CD4+ T cells of both 
subclinical and clinical animals, indicating a change in T cell phenotype with
disease state. Interestingly, proximal T cell receptor signaling was not altered 
in infected animals. This study demonstrated changes in crucial signaling
molecules in animals infected with MAP, thereby elucidating T cell alterations
associated with disease progression.
