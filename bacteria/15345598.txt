Events mediating stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12) chemotaxis of 
lymphocytes are not completely known. We evaluated intracellular signaling
through RasGAP-associated protein p62Dok-1 (downstream of tyrosine kinase
[Dok-1]) and associated proteins. SDF-1alpha/CXCL12 stimulated Dok-1 tyrosine
phosphorylation and association with RasGAP, adaptor protein p46Nck, and Crk-L in
Jurkat T cells. The phosphorylation of Dok-1 was blocked by pretreatment of cells
with the src kinase inhibitor PP2. Src kinase family member Lck was implicated.
SDF-1alpha/CXCL12 did not phosphorylate Dok-1 in J.CaM1.6 cells, a Jurkat
derivative not expressing Lck, but did phosphorylate Dok-1 in J.CaM1.6 cells
expressing Lck. SDF-1alpha/CXCL12 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2
and the association of Pyk2 with zeta chain-associated protein-70 kilodaltons
(Zap-70) and Vav. SDF-1alpha/CXCL12 enhanced the association of RasGAP with Pyk2.
CXCR4-expressing NIH3T3 and Baf3 cells transfected with full-length Dok-1 cDNA
were suppressed in their responses to SDF-1alpha/CXCL12-induced chemotaxis;
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was also decreased. Chemotaxis to
SDF-1/CXCL12 was significantly enhanced in Dok-1(-/-) CD4+ and CD8+ splenic T
cells. These results implicate Dok-1, Nck, Crk-L, and Src kinases-especially Lck,
Pyk2, Zap-70, Vav, and Ras-GAP-in intracellular signaling by SDF-1alpha/CXCL12,
and they suggest that Dok-1 plays an important role in SDF-1alpha/CXCL12-induced 
chemotaxis in T cells.
