During translation, some +1 frameshift mRNA sites are decoded by frameshift
suppressor tRNAs that contain an extra base in their anticodon loops. Similarly
engineered tRNAs have been used to insert nonnatural amino acids into proteins.
Here, we report crystal structures of two anticodon stem-loops (ASLs) from tRNAs 
known to facilitate +1 frameshifting bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit with
their cognate mRNAs. ASL(CCCG) and ASL(ACCC) (5'-3' nomenclature) form
unpredicted anticodon-codon interactions where the anticodon base 34 at the
wobble position contacts either the fourth codon base or the third and fourth
codon bases. In addition, we report the structure of ASL(ACGA) bound to the 30S
ribosomal subunit with its cognate mRNA. The tRNA containing this ASL was
previously shown to be unable to facilitate +1 frameshifting in competition with 
normal tRNAs (Hohsaka et al. 2001), and interestingly, it displays a normal
anticodon-codon interaction. These structures show that the expanded anticodon
loop of +1 frameshift promoting tRNAs are flexible enough to adopt conformations 
that allow three bases of the anticodon to span four bases of the mRNA. Therefore
it appears that normal triplet pairing is not an absolute constraint of the
decoding center.
