We overexpressed one of the hydrophobic repeated domains (HBDs) (110 amino acid
residues) of the cellulose-binding protein (CbpA) from Clostridium cellulovorans 
by making a hybrid protein with the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein
(MalE). The HBD was purified to homogeneity, and interactions between the HBD and
endoglucanases were analyzed by a novel interaction Western blotting
(immunoblotting) method. The HBD had specific interactions with endoglucanases
(EngB and EngD) from C. cellulovorans. These results indicated that the HBD was
an endoglucanase binding site of CbpA.
