BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (S. gallolyticus) is
the causative pathogen in up to 20% of streptococcal-induced infective
endocarditis (IE) cases. However, the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis in S.
gallolyticus have not yet been solved. Pathogens causing IE need to employ
virulent strategies to initiate and establish infections, such as escape the
bloodstream, invade the host-cell, and persist intracellularly. In this study, we
examined the induction of inflammation by different S. gallolyticus strains in
relation to their survival in whole blood and cell culture models as well as
their ability to induce platelet aggregation. Phagocytosis of these bacteria by
macrophages, followed by intracellular survival, was also quantified.
METHODS: In whole blood and THP-1 cell culture assays bacterial growth kinetics
was determined by plating, followed by colony counting. Induction of interleukin 
(IL)-6 expression in whole blood of three healthy volunteers, caused by different
strains, was quantified by ELISA. Gene expression of cytokines (IL1B, IL6 and
IL8) was quantified by real-time PCR after stimulating THP-1 monocytes with
bacteria. Induction of platelet aggregation was analyzed by light transmission
aggregometry using the BORN method. A macrophage model was used to analyze
phagocytosis of strains and their survival in macrophages within 48 h.
RESULTS: Strains promoted IL-6 secretion in a time-dependent fashion. For
example, DSM16831 induced IL-6 secretion in whole blood earlier than other
isolates, and was eliminated in the whole blood of one volunteer, whereas UCN34
could grow. Platelet aggregation depended on the different isolates used and on
the individual platelet donor. Two strains (AC1181 and 010672/01) induced
cytokine gene expression in THP-1 monocytes only marginally, compared to other
strains. The phagocytosis rate of S. gallolyticus isolates differed
significantly, and the isolates UCN34 and BAA-2069 could persist for a
considerable time in the phagocytes.
CONCLUSION: The strain-dependent differences of S. gallolyticus isolates,
observed during interaction with human blood cells, support the hypotheses that
divergences in individual virulence factors determine a distinct pathogenicity of
the isolates. These data constitute an additional step towards the elucidation of
mechanisms in the complex, multifactorial pathogenesis of this IE pathogen.
