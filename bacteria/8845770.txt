Adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL) from Bacillus subtilis has been crystallized and
structural analysis by X-ray diffraction is in progress. ASL is a 200-kDa
homotetramer that catalyzes two distinct steps of de novo purine biosynthesis
leading to the formation of AMP and IMP; both steps involve the beta-elimination 
of fumarate. A single point mutation in the human ASL gene has been linked to
mental retardation with autistic features. In addition, ASL plays an important
role in the bioprocessing of anti-HIV therapeutics. B subtilis ASL, which shares 
30% sequence identity and 70% sequence similarity with human ASL, has been
crystallized and data to 3.3 A have been collected at 100 K. The space group is
P6(1)22 or P6(5)22 with a = b = 129.4 A; the length of the c-axis varies between 
275 and 290 A, depending on the crystal. An analysis of solvent content indicates
a dimer in the asymmetric unit, although a self-rotation function and an analysis
of native Pattersons failed to identify unambiguously the location of any
noncrystallographic symmetry axes. Structure determination by isomorphous
replacement is in progress.
