In this study, we analyzed the putative functions of stabilin-1 in blood
monocytes. Microarray analysis revealed downregulation of several proinflammatory
genes in the stabilin-1(high) monocytes when compared with stabilin-1(low)
monocytes. When cocultured with stabilin-1(high) monocytes, IFN-γ synthesis by T 
cells was diminished in Ag-recall assays. Knockdown of stabilin-1 in monocytes
increased the synthesis of several proinflammatory molecules, including TNF-α,
and supported high IFN-γ and low IL-4 and IL-5 production by T cells in
Ag-specific stimulation assays. Anti-stabilin-1 Ab treatment also led to
increased IFN-γ synthesis in the recall assays. In clinical settings, the
expression of stabilin-1 was diminished on blood monocytes and tissue macrophages
under proinflammatory conditions. These data define stabilin-1 as a new
immunosuppressive molecule and suggest that stabilin-1(high) monocytes may dampen
proinflammatory reactions in vivo.
