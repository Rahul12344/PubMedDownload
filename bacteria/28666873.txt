Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from bacteria are promising candidates for
subunit vaccines. Stresses that modulate the composition of outer membrane
proteins (OMPs) are important for OMV synthesis. Small RNAs (sRNAs) expressed in 
response to stress regulate OMPs, although the mechanism underlying sRNA-mediated
OMV biogenesis and its utility for developing vaccine platforms remains to be
elucidated. Here, we characterized the role of a sRNA, MicA, which regulates
OmpA, a major OMP involved in both production of OMVs and reactive immunity
against Salmonella challenge. A Salmonella strain overexpressing MicA generated
more OMVs than a control strain. In addition, OmpC was the major component of
MicA-derived OMV proteins. MicA-derived OMVs induced Th1- and Th17-type immune
responses in vitro and reduced Salmonella-mediated lethality in a mouse model.
Thus, OmpA-regulatory sRNA-derived OMVs may facilitate production of
Salmonella-protective vaccines.
