Type 1 natural killer T (NKT) cells are a population of CD1d-restricted,
regulatory T cells that exhibit various NK cell characteristics and rapidly
produce cytokines on stimulation with glycolipid antigen. In type I diabetes
(TID), NKT cells are thought to have a tolerogenic function, evidenced by NKT
cell numerical and functional deficiencies in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, 
which when corrected, can ameliorate disease. The mechanisms by which NKT cells
can mediate their immunosuppressive effects in NOD mice are still poorly
understood, which makes successful clinical translation of NKT- cell-based
therapies challenging. However, new insights into the genetic control of NKT cell
deficiencies have provided some understanding of the genes that may control NKT
cell number and function, potentially offering a new avenue for assessing TID
risk in humans. Here, we review the mechanisms by which NKT cells are thought to 
prevent TID, discuss the evidence for involvement of NKT cells in the regulation 
of human TID and examine the genetic control of NKT cell number and function. A
greater understanding of these areas will increase the chances of successful
clinical manipulation of NKT cells to prevent or treat TID.
