It is well established that the bacterial superantigens bind to both TCR
beta-chain and, with moderate affinity, to MHC class II molecules. Class
II-bearing cells bind the superantigen and present the superantigen to T cells
expressing certain TCR beta-chain variable region alleles. We have observed that 
the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) B binds to COS-1, an African
green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell line. This cell line fails to express
class II and the binding of SEB is saturable. Scatchard analysis of radiolabeled 
ligand binding data reveals a binding affinity for COS of 51 nM, while binding to
DR1-transfected L cells is measured at 150 nM. Further analysis shows that SEB
bound to COS cells, unlike SEB bound to DR1-bearing L cells, is not recognized by
T cells in the presence or absence of accessory cytokines or anti-CD28. Studies
carried out with chemical cross-linking agents show that radiolabeled SEB
associates with a membrane protein of approximately 85 kDa. These studies suggest
that the alternative superantigen binding molecule (p85) binds SEB with an
affinity roughly equivalent to SEB binding by class II molecules, but at a site
which does not permit recognition by the TCR.
