Whether or not CD4(+) T-cells express low affinity receptor FcγRIIIa (CD16a) in
disease pathology has not been examined in great detail. In this study, we show
that a subset of activated CD4(+) T-cells in humans express FcγRIIIa. The
ligation of FcγRIIIa by immune complexes (ICs) in human CD4(+) T-cells produced
co-stimulatory signal like CD28 that triggered IFN-γ production. The induced
expression of FcγRIIIa on CD4(+) helper T-cells is an important finding since
these receptors via ITAM contribute to intracellular signaling. The induced
expression of FcγRIIIa on CD4(+) T helper cells and their ability to co-stimulate
T-cell activation are important and novel findings that may reveal new pathways
to regulate adaptive immune responses during inflammation and in autoimmunity.
