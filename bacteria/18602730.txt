Intramuscular immunization of mice with DNA cocktail vaccines, comprising
potential protective antigens P36, P46, NrdF, and P97or P97R1 of Mycoplasma
hyopneumoniae, induced strong Th1-polarized immune responses against each
antigen, with only P46 eliciting a serum IgG response. Subcutaneous immunization 
with protein cocktail vaccines, surprisingly, induced both Th1-polarized immune
response as well as antibody response whereas mice immunized with DNA cocktail
vaccines followed by boosting with protein cocktail vaccines generated strong
Th1-polarized and humoral immune responses. P97 was not recognized by serum
antibodies from commercial bacterin-immunized mice indicating potential lack of
expression of this important antigen in inactivated whole-cell vaccines.
