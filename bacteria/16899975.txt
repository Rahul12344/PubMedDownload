Acute bacterial infectious diseases are mostly treated empirically at admission
before the culture results are available. According to the risk for serious
complications in the case of therapeutic failure, it is important to evaluate the
therapy results and change to a more appropriate antibiotic regime as soon as
possible. In the present study, 40 patients with X-ray-verified
community-acquired pneumonia were examined and blood specimens were collected
before and within 24 h of treatment. Body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP)
and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were investigated. Thirty-two patients
received an appropriate initial antibiotic therapy regarding clinical outcome,
but in 8 patients the treatment was changed because of therapy failure. Changes
of HGF levels after 18-24 h of treatment could predict the therapeutic results
accurately in 38 of 40 cases (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94%, positive
likelihood ratio 16.0). HGF was significantly better to predict therapy outcome
than CRP (p < 0.0001).
