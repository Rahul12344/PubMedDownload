Studies were done in baboons and humans to assess the role of interleukin (IL)-1 
on the release of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFRs) during sepsis.
In baboons, IL-1 alpha induced increased levels of sTNFR types I and II. Infusion
of Escherichia coli into baboons also led to higher sTNFR levels. Treatment with 
IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra) attenuated the rise in sTNFR-I, which was
positively correlated with a partial preservation of renal function by IL-1ra. In
patients with sepsis, treatment with IL-1ra also was associated with lower levels
of sTNFR-1 but did not influence plasma creatinine levels. IL-1ra did not affect 
sTNFR-II in baboons or humans. These data suggest that IL-1 produced during
sepsis is involved in increases in sTNFR-I. Such increases during rapidly fatal
septic shock may in part be explained by an effect on the renal clearance of
sTNFR-I.
