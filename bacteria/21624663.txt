A major function of the immune system is to protect the host from microbial
infections. The complement system plays important roles in both the innate and
the adaptive immune defense and also acts as a bridge between these arms of
immunity. This is obvious from complement deficiencies which in varying degree,
depending on which factor is missing, are associated with increased infection
susceptibility and also increased risk for other, mainly autoimmune diseases.
Genetically determined deficiencies are described for almost all complement
proteins but the consequences show a wide variation. Here the genetic defects and
molecular abnormalities in complement deficient persons, related clinically
relevant infections and the options for prevention and therapy are reviewed. The 
roles of complement in host defense against common infections are also discussed.
