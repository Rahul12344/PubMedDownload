resulting in a giant false aneurysm of the complete thoracic aorta.

A 69-year-old man was presented with a holosystolic and early diastolic murmur in
cardiac auscultation, pretibial edema and elevated inflammation markers. Aortic
valve and ascending aorta had been replaced 9 months earlier. Transesophageal
echocardiography revealed massive eccentric regurgitation and dehiscence of the
aortic valve, resulting in a giant circular false aneurysm with connection to the
lumen of the aortic arch. CT and MR confirmed extensive leakage in a covered
perforation. The false lumen was confined by a newly formed vessel wall, since
the native Aorta ascendens had been excised. Smooth muscle cells expressing the
progenitor marker CD34 were detected selectively in this region, indicating a
contribution of circulating progenitor cells to the false vessel wall. After
detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis in blood, another urgent Bentall
operation was performed. However, the patient succumbed to right ventricular
failure and multiple organ failure on postoperative day 1.
