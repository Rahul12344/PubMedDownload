Signaling from the TCR regulates T lymphoid survival, deletion by apoptosis, and 
selective clonal expansion. One set of signaling pathways activated during thymic
selection leads to degradation of a cytosolic retention protein, the inhibitor of
kappaB (IkappaB)alpha, followed by nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB/Rel
family of transcription factors. It has been found previously that NF-kappaB
proteins mediate a pathway signaling the survival of mature T cells and
protection of thymocytes against TNF-induced apoptosis. In contrast, we show in
this study that a transgenic inhibitor of NF-kappaB/Rel signaling interferes with
the negative selection of immature thymocytes by endogenous MHC ligands in vivo. 
Positive selection of the H-Y TCR also was diminished. This attenuation of thymic
selection efficiency was associated with decreased ZAP-70 phosphorylation and TCR
signaling of CD69 induction. These findings demonstrate that the NF-kappaB
transcriptional pathway plays an important role in normal processes of clonal
deletion and they indicate that the NF-kappaB/IkappaB axis can regulate the
efficiency of TCR signaling.
