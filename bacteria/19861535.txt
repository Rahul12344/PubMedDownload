Fanconi anemia is a cancer-prone inherited bone marrow failure and cancer
susceptibility syndrome with at least 13 complementation groups (FANCA, FANCB,
FANCC, FANCD1, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ, FANCL, FANCM, and
FANCN). Our laboratory has previously described several regulatory
phosphorylation events for core complex member proteins FANCG and FANCA by
phosphorylation. In this study, we report a novel phosphorylation site serine 331
(S331) of FANCD2, the pivotal downstream player of the Fanconi anemia pathway.
Phosphorylation of S331 is important for its DNA damage-inducible
monoubiquitylation, resistance to DNA cross-linkers, and in vivo interaction with
FANCD1/BRCA2. A phosphomimetic mutation at S331 restores all of these phenotypes 
to wild-type. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that phosphorylation of S331 
is mediated by CHK1, the S-phase checkpoint kinase implicated in the Fanconi
anemia DNA repair pathway.
