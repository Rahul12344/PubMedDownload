Immunodominant T cell epitopes from the autoantigen human cartilage glycoprotein 
39 have previously been mapped in the context of HLA-DR*0401 and *0402, using
mice expressing HLA-DR4 transgenes. We measured the dissociation rates of these
epitopes from soluble recombinant DR*0401 and DR*0402 to assess the relationship 
between peptide/HLA-DR4 kinetic stability and immunogenicity. Experiments were
performed at endosomal pH (5.5) and at cell surface pH (7), in the absence and
presence of soluble recombinant HLA-DM (sDM). All (4/4) immunodominant
peptide/HLA-DR complexes exhibit dissociation half-times of 1h to several days.
In contrast, most (3/4) non-immunodominant complexes dissociate with half-times
<30 min under at least one of these conditions. Interestingly, a complex which is
stable except in the presence of HLA-DM at pH 5.5 is immunogenic only following
peptide immunization, while a complex which is stable at acidic but not at
neutral pH, is non-immunogenic following either whole protein or peptide
immunization. These data indicate that kinetic stability of peptide/MHC complexes
in vivo is a key determinant of immunogenicity.
