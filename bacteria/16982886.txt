CD80 and CD86 have been shown to play a critical role in the optimal activation
of T cells. Although these two molecules bind the same ligand, CD28, the question
of whether CD80 and CD86 provide unique signals or serve redundant roles remains 
controversial. Previous studies have suggested that CD80 binding to CD28 may be
superior to CD86 for the activation of naive CD8+ T cells. This study provides a 
potential mechanism to explain these observations. Our study demonstrates a
previously unappreciated role for CD80, its superiority over CD86 in promoting
CD25 expression, increasing both the number of cells that express CD25 and the
level expressed on a per cell basis. These findings provide new insights into the
role of CD80 vs CD86 and have important implications for the design of vaccines
and immunotherapeutics aimed at the generation of a robust CD8+ T cell response
in vivo.
