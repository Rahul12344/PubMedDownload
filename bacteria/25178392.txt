Oomycetes form a deep lineage of eukaryotic organisms that includes a large
number of plant pathogens which threaten natural and managed ecosystems. We
undertook a survey to query the community for their ranking of plant-pathogenic
oomycete species based on scientific and economic importance. In total, we
received 263 votes from 62 scientists in 15 countries for a total of 33 species. 
The Top 10 species and their ranking are: (1) Phytophthora infestans; (2, tied)
Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis; (2, tied) Phytophthora ramorum; (4) Phytophthora 
sojae; (5) Phytophthora capsici; (6) Plasmopara viticola; (7) Phytophthora
cinnamomi; (8, tied) Phytophthora parasitica; (8, tied) Pythium ultimum; and (10)
Albugo candida. This article provides an introduction to these 10 taxa and a
snapshot of current research. We hope that the list will serve as a benchmark for
future trends in oomycete research.
