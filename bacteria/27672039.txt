Traditionally recognized as an RNA splicing regulator, heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNPC1/C2) can also bind to double-stranded DNA and
function in trans as a vitamin D response element (VDRE)-binding protein. As
such, hnRNPC1/C2 may couple transcription induced by the active form of vitamin
D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) with subsequent RNA splicing. In MG63
osteoblastic cells, increased expression of the 1,25(OH)2D target gene CYP24A1
involved immunoprecipitation of hnRNPC1/C2 with CYP24A1 chromatin and RNA.
Knockdown of hnRNPC1/C2 suppressed expression of CYP24A1, but also increased
expression of an exon 10-skipped CYP24A1 splice variant; in a minigene model the 
latter was attenuated by a functional VDRE in the CYP24A1 promoter. In
genome-wide analyses, knockdown of hnRNPC1/C2 resulted in 3500 differentially
expressed genes and 2232 differentially spliced genes, with significant
commonality between groups. 1,25(OH)2D induced 324 differentially expressed
genes, with 187 also observed following hnRNPC1/C2 knockdown, and a further 168
unique to hnRNPC1/C2 knockdown. However, 1,25(OH)2D induced only 10
differentially spliced genes, with no overlap with differentially expressed
genes. These data indicate that hnRNPC1/C2 binds to both DNA and RNA and
influences both gene expression and RNA splicing, but these actions do not appear
to be linked through 1,25(OH)2D-mediated induction of transcription.
