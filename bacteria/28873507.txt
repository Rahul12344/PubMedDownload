Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) is the causative agent of Lyme disease in the United
States, a disease that can result in carditis, and chronic and debilitating
arthritis and/or neurologic symptoms if left untreated. Bb survives in the midgut
of the Ixodes scapularis tick, or within tissues of immunocompetent hosts. In the
early stages of infection, the bacteria are present in the bloodstream where they
must resist clearance by the innate immune system of the host. We have found a
novel role for outer surface protein C (OspC) from B. burgdorferi and B. garinii 
in interactions with the complement component C4b and bloodstream survival in
vivo. Our data show that OspC inhibits the classical and lectin complement
pathways and competes with complement protein C2 for C4b binding. Resistance to
complement is important for maintenance of the lifecycle of Bb, enabling survival
of the pathogen within the host as well as in the midgut of a feeding tick when
ospC expression is induced.
