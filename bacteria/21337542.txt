Even though Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains one of the top microbial
killers, more than 90% of the 2 billion infected individuals never develop active
tuberculosis (TB), indicating efficient immune control of infection in these
individuals. Immune mechanisms promoting either control or reactivation of TB are
incompletely understood. Kinetic analyses of T-cell responses against Mtb in
C57BL/6 mice revealed surface expression of inducible co-stimulatory molecule
(ICOS) on >30% of all CD4(+) T cells, suggesting a pivotal role of this
costimulatory molecule of the CD28 family in TB control. Surprisingly,
Mtb-infected ICOS(-/-) mice showed lower bacterial burden during the late chronic
stage of infection as compared to WT controls. ICOS deficiency resulted in a
reduced Mtb-specific CD8(+) T-cell response during late-stage infection. In
contrast, the polyclonal CD4(+) Th1 response against Mtb was increased, most
likely caused by diminished numbers and frequencies of Tregs. Thus, by altering
effector T-cell populations differentially, ICOS signaling modulates TB control
in the late stage of infection.
