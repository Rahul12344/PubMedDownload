The kinetic friction force and the adhesion force of Bacillus thuringiensis
spores on planar surfaces in atmospheric systems were studied using atomic force 
microscopy. The influence of relative humidity (RH) on these forces varied for
different surface properties including hydrophobicity, roughness, and surface
charge. The friction force of the spore was greater on a rougher surface than on 
mica, which is atomically flat. As RH increases, the friction force of the spores
decreases on mica whereas it increases on rough surfaces. The influence of RH on 
the interaction forces between hydrophobic surfaces is not as strong as for
hydrophilic surfaces. The friction force of the spore is linear to the sum of the
adhesion force and normal load on the hydrophobic surface. The poorly defined
surface structure of the spore and the adsorption of contaminants from the
surrounding atmosphere are believed to cause a discrepancy between the calculated
and measured adhesion forces.
