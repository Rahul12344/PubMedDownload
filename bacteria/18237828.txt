Protection of rainbow trout fry following bath vaccination with a bacterin of Y. 
ruckeri O1, the bacterial pathogen causing enteric red mouth disease (ERM), was
investigated at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C. Rainbow trout fry were acclimatised for 8
weeks at the three temperatures before vaccination. They were subsequently
challenged with Y. ruckeri 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination which demonstrated a
significant protection of vaccinated fish kept at 15 degrees C. No protective
effect of vaccination in rainbow trout reared at 5 and 25 degrees C could be
recorded. Spleen tissue was sampled from vaccinated and control fish at 0, 8, 24 
and 72 h post-vaccination in order to analyse gene transcript profiles using
quantitative real-time RT-PCR (q-PCR). Gene expression in fish vaccinated at 15
degrees C (the protected fish) was up-regulated with regard to the
pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory
cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta, the cell receptors TcR, CD8alpha, CD4, C5aR and the
teleost specific immunoglobulin IgT. Passive immunisation using transfer of
plasma from vaccinated fish to na√Øve fish conferred no protection. This indicates
that humoral factors such as Ig and complement are less important in the
protection induced by bath vaccination. Expression of cellular factors such as
CD8alpha was significantly increased in the protected trout and this suggests
that cellular factors including cytotoxic T-cells could play a role in immunity
against Y. ruckeri.
