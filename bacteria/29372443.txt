OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent important facets of the
immune system controlling infectious diseases. However, pathogens show varying
susceptibilities to AMPs. This study investigates the susceptibilities of strains
of Streptococcus mutans (SM), Actinomyces naeslundii (AN), and Lactobacillus spp.
(LB) towards AMPs and if there are correlations between the appearance of such
high-risk strains and clinical caries status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plaque samples were collected from patients along with
clinical examinations. Bacterial strains were identified via selective media,
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis-time of flight (MALDI-TOF), 
and arbitrary-primed-PCR (AP-PCR). Each strain was tested for susceptibility to
LL-37, HBD-2, HNP-1, and HNP-3 or phosphate-buffered saline as negative control
in a biofilm model on hydroxylapatite discs. Survival rates and resulting risk
classification for each strain were determined. Correlations were calculated
between the number of high-risk strains (all/S. mutans) appearing in patients and
their clinical caries status.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included with mean DMFT values of 11.4 ± 8.7. 
A total of 8 different SM, 30 LB, and 47 AN strains were detected. One-way ANOVA 
indicated that type/concentration of AMPs had major influence on reductions of
Lactobacilli and Actinomyces. Seventeen strains of AN, 2 of SM, and 6 of LB had
low susceptibilities to AMPs. The number of such strains in patients showed
significant positive correlations to the DMFT values (all p = 0.001; r = 0.452;
S. mutans p < 0.0001, r = 0.558).
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of low susceptible strains to AMPs seems to correlate 
with the individual caries status.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results may lead to new ways to identify individuals with
increased caries risk.
