BACKGROUND: Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) plays a role in the innate defence
system at mucosal surfaces. Colonisation of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach is
an important pathological factor in gastrointestinal illnesses, including
gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric adenocarcinoma.
AIMS: To evaluate the antibacterial role of hBD-2 against H pylori infection in
the gastric mucosa.
SUBJECTS: Biopsied gastric mucosa specimens from H pylori positive (n=6) and H
pylori negative (n=6) individuals were used. H pylori was determined by the
presence of urease activity and microscopic examination.
METHODS: The specimens were examined for hBD-2 expression by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and in
situ hybridisation. The antibacterial effect of hBD-2 against H pylori was
evaluated by the number of colony forming units of H pylori after incubation with
0, 10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6), or 10(-5) M of hBD-2 peptide.
RESULTS: All six H pylori positive specimens expressed a high level of hBD-2 mRNA
while hBD-2 mRNA was not detected in the H pylori negative specimens by RT-PCR.
Immunohistochemistry using anti-hBD-2 antiserum revealed that hBD-2 was expressed
in the surface epithelium of H pylori infected specimens. In gastric specimens
obtained after H pylori eradication, hBD-2 immunoreactivity had dramatically
decreased. In situ hybridisation confirmed that hBD-2 transcripts were localised 
in the epithelium of H pylori infected gastric specimens. Incubation with hBD-2
reduced the growth rate of cultured H pylori in a dose dependent manner, and
incubation with 10(-5) M hBD-2 completely inhibited the proliferation of H
pylori.
CONCLUSIONS: H pylori infection induces hBD-2 expression in the human gastric
epithelium. hBD-2 inhibited the growth of H pylori in vitro, suggesting that
hBD-2 plays an antibacterial role in H pylori induced gastritis.
