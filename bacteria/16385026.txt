Type IV pili play an important role in bacterial adhesion, motility, and biofilm 
formation. Here we present high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
of type IV pili from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. An individual pilus ranges 
in length from 0.5 to 7 microm and has a diameter from 4 to 6 nm, although often,
pili bundles in which the individual filaments differed in both length and
diameter were seen. By attaching bacteria to AFM tips, it was possible to fasten 
the bacteria to mica surfaces by pili tethers. Force spectra of tethered pili
gave rupture forces of 95 pN. The slopes of force curves close to the rupture
force were nearly linear but showed little variation with pilus length.
Furthermore, force curves could not be fitted with wormlike-chain polymer stretch
models when using realistic persistence lengths for pili. The observation that
the slopes near rupture did not depend on the pili length suggests that they do
not represent elastic properties of the pili. It is possible that this region of 
the force curves is determined by an elastic element that is part of the
bacterial wall, although further experiments are needed to confirm this.
