BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces cellular necrosis that could
promote spread of infection. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of
Vitamin D3 supplementation to improve the effectiveness of 2nd-line
anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug therapy, especially in relation with cell death
pathways.
METHODS: Mus musculus C3HeB/FeJ was randomly divided into four groups containing 
eight animals each. The 1st group (G1), consisting of mice that were
intratracheally infected with multidrug-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis and
sacrificed on 2-week postinfection to confirm successful infection. (G2) was a
group of TB mice without therapy. Then, (G3) was a group of mice with the
2nd-line anti-TB therapy. The last group (G4) was a group of mice receiving not
only the 2nd-line anti-TB therapy but also daily oral Vitamin D3 supplementation.
Immunohistochemistry was used to measure expression of nuclear Vitamin D
receptor, apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3, cathelin-related antimicrobial
peptide (CRAMP) and LC3B autophagy markers, necrosis marker RIPK3, and
collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1). The number of bacteria in the lung
was calculated by colony forming units. The partial least square structural
equation modeling with SmartPLS 3.2.6 software was used to analyze structural
models among the variables.
RESULTS: Supplementation of Vitamin D3 on the 2nd-line anti-TB therapy increases 
Vitamin D3 receptor, CRAMP, LC3B, caspase-3 (P = 0.026, P = 0.000, P= 0.001),
presses MMP1, and the number of bacteria (P = 0.010 and P= 0.000, respectively). 
The structural equation modeling analysis shows that increasing autophagy
pathways reduces necrosis by lowering MMP1, whereas apoptosis reduces necrosis by
decreasing the number of bacteria (each with indirect effects - 0.543 and -
0.544).
CONCLUSION: A comprehensive analysis with the partial least square structural
equation modeling shows decreasing necrosis requires increasing autophagy and
apoptosis.
