The hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis is the granuloma, which consists
predominantly of lymphocytes and macrophages and promotes immune-cell interaction
with the causative pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Granuloma formation is a
highly organized process, which depends on leukocyte recruitment facilitated by
adhesion molecules and chemokines. Thus, during chronic experimental
tuberculosis, granulomata display characteristics of lymphoid structures
comprising follicular aggregation of B cells, formation of high endothelial
venules, presence of follicular dendritic cells, and expression of the
homeostatic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL19. CCR7-/- mice, which are deficient in
CCL19 and CCL21 signaling, exhibit increased local inflammatory infiltrates but
no follicular B-cell aggregation within those lymphoid structures. However,
CCR7-deficient mice are fully capable to control pulmonary tuberculosis; at time 
points later than 6 weeks postinfection, they carry a lower bacterial load in
peripheral organs. Our results show that, during chronic pulmonary tuberculosis
in mice, the homeostatic chemokine signaling-network contributes to spatial
organization of the granulomatous response, which participates in both
containment of M. tuberculosis and the latter's dissemination to other organs.
