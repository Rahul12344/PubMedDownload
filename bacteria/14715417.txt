The inhibition of the biological activity of IL-1 by recombinant human IL-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has been investigated in several, controlled
clinical trials. Encouraging results have been reported, in particular in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we investigated the
influence of treatment of wild type mice with IL-1ra, which resulted in an
incomplete and transient inhibition of IL-1 activity. Treatment with recombinant 
human IL-1ra resulted in an enhanced bacterial outgrowth in the lungs of BALB/c
and C57BL/6 mice early after induction of pneumococcal pneumonia, without
influencing survival or the pulmonary inflammatory response. The effect of IL-1ra
on the host response to S. pneumoniae pneumonia is modest and transient. The
present data, together with the findings in IL-1R*/* mice in earlier work,
suggest that IL-1 occupies a role in the pulmonary immune response to S.
pneumoniae that is substantially less prominent than that of TNF-alpha.
