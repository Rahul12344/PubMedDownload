This study details the first diagnosis of Francisella sp. in tilapia in the
United Kingdom. Losses of tilapia fry at a recirculation fish farm in England
were investigated, giving a presumptive positive diagnosis of infection with
Francisella sp. by histopathological examination. Most fish sampled showed
moderate to marked pathology of the major organs, with lesions being present in
most tissues. The most obvious host response was granuloma formulation. A
subsequent follow-up visit provided further evidence for the presence of a
Francisella species. PCR amplicons were obtained using Francisella spp.-specific 
primers that shared 100% sequence identity with the 16S rRNA gene of the type
strain of the species F. asiatica previously described as the cause of disease in
tilapia in Southeast Asia and Central America. This outbreak and the subsequent
investigation emphasise the importance of strict biosecurity at fish farms and
the care that needs to be taken when using a new supplier of fish.
