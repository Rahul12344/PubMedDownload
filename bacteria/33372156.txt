Macrophages activated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in combination with other
proinflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), respond with transcriptional and cellular changes that enhance clearance
of intracellular pathogens at the risk of damaging tissues. IFN-γ effects must
therefore be carefully balanced with inhibitory mechanisms to prevent
immunopathology. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in a
macrophage cell line to identify negative regulators of IFN-γ responses. We
discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitin-fold modifier (Ufm1) conjugation
system (herein UFMylation) in inhibiting responses to IFN-γ and
lipopolysaccharide. Enhanced IFN-γ activation in UFMylation-deficient cells
resulted in increased transcriptional responses to IFN-γ in a manner dependent on
endoplasmic reticulum stress responses involving Ern1 and Xbp1. Furthermore,
UFMylation in myeloid cells is required for resistance to influenza infection in 
mice, indicating that this pathway modulates in vivo responses to infection.
These findings provide a genetic roadmap for the regulation of responses to a key
mediator of cellular immunity and identify a molecular link between the
UFMylation pathway and immune responses.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interest statement: D.R.B., M.R.M., and
H.W.V. are now employed at Vir Biotechnology, but the initial findings reported
here were made while at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
The work at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis was not funded 
by Vir Biotechnology. J.G.D. consults for Agios, Foghorn Therapeutics, Maze
Therapeutics, Merck, and Pfizer; J.G.D. consults for and has equity in Tango
Therapeutics. J.G.D.’s interests were reviewed and are managed by the Broad
Institute in accordance with its conflict of interest policies. H.W.V. is a
founder of Casma Therapeutics, an autophagy-focused company. This paper has data 
relevant to autophagy, but the research in the paper was not funded by Casma.
D.R.B., M.R.M., and H.W.V. are employees and hold stock in Vir Biotechnology,
where some of the work was performed. H.W.V. is a founder of PierianDx, a genomic
diagnostics company that did not fund the research in this report.
