INTRODUCTION: HIV-induced changes in cytokine responses to bacteria may influence
susceptibility to bacterial infections and the consequent inflammatory response.
METHODS: We examined the impact of HIV on whole blood responsiveness to bacterial
stimulation in asymptomatic subjects and patients with bacterial bloodstream
infection (BSI). Whole blood was stimulated ex vivo with two bacterial Toll-like 
receptor agonists (lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid) and two pathogens
(Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typhoidal Salmonella), which are relevant in
HIV-positive patients. Production of interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor-α,
interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 was used as a read-out.
RESULTS: In asymptomatic subjects, HIV infection was associated with reduced
interferon-γ, release after stimulation and priming of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine response to non-typhoidal Salmonella. In patients with BSI, we found no 
such priming effect, nor was there evidence for more profound sepsis-induced
immunosuppression in BSI patients with HIV co-infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a complex effect of HIV on leukocyte responses
to bacteria. However, in patients with sepsis, leukocyte responses were equally
blunted in patients with and without HIV infection.
