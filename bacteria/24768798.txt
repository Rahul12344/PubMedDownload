Hexanoic acid can be used for diverse industrial applications and is a precursor 
for fine chemistry. Although some natural microorganisms have been screened and
evolved to produce hexanoic acid, the construction of an engineered biosynthetic 
pathway for producing hexanoic acid in yeast has not been reported. Here we
constructed hexanoic acid pathways in Kluyveromyces marxianus by integrating 5
combinations of seven genes (AtoB, BktB, Crt, Hbd, MCT1, Ter, and TES1), by which
random chromosomal sites of the strain are overwritten by the new genes from
bacteria and yeast. One recombinant strain, H4A, which contained AtoB, BktB, Crt,
Hbd, and Ter, produced 154mg/L of hexanoic acid from galactose as the sole
substrate. However, the hexanoic acid produced by the H4A strain was
re-assimilated during the fermentation due to the reverse activity of AtoB, which
condenses two acetyl-CoAs into a single acetoacetyl-CoA. This product instability
could be overcome by the replacement of AtoB with a malonyl CoA-acyl carrier
protein transacylase (MCT1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results suggest
that Mct1 provides a slow but stable acetyl-CoA chain elongation pathway, whereas
the AtoB-mediated route is fast but unstable. In conclusion, hexanoic acid was
produced for the first time in yeast by the construction of chain elongation
pathways comprising 5-7 genes in K. marxianus.
