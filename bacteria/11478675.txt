Bacterial binding was studied to determine whether thrombospondin-1 (TSP) acts as
a ligand in attachment of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Twenty-five of 
27 CNS strains bound soluble TSP. Staphylococcus epidermidis J9P bound
125I-labelled TSP in a dose-dependent manner. Scatchard plot analysis of the
binding of TSP by strain J9P revealed two Kd values of 6.4 x 10(-9) M and 2.9 x
10(-8) M. The binding structures of strain J9P were sensitive to protease and
were resistant to heat treatment. Unlabelled TSP and recombinant von Willebrand
factor inhibited binding of TSP by strain J9P, but other proteins or
monosaccharides did not. Heparin inhibited binding of TSP to strain J9P and two
other S. epidermidis strains, BD5703 and BD969. Fusion proteins of the type 1
repeats, type 2 repeats, type 3 repeats and C-terminal domain of TSP or the
synthetic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide did not inhibit binding of TSP to bacteria. TSP
promoted adhesion of S. epidermidis strains when it was immobilised on polymer
surfaces. These results indicate that the specific interaction between CNS and
TSP may contribute to bacterial adhesion on biomaterial surfaces. The N-terminal 
heparin-binding domain of TSP appears to be the major region for recognition by
CNS.
