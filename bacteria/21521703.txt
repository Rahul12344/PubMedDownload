Current concerns about multiresistance and a diminishing antibiotic pipeline are 
mainly addressed to Gram-negative bacteria. The greatest fear within the
Gram-positive arena is vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Its
epidemiology and clinical presentation give cause for concern, but so far its
impact has been strictly limited. While this may change, the loss of
glycopeptides as a treatment option may not, in fact, be all bad news.
