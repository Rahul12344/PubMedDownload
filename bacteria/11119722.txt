A new mutation in human F(1)F(0) ATPase6, T9176G, which changes Leu 217 to an
Arg, has been described in two siblings with Leigh syndrome [Carrozzo et al.
(2000) Neurology, in press]. This mutation was modeled in Escherichia coli by
changing Leu 259 (the equivalent residue) to Arg and the properties of the
altered ECF(1)F(0) were compared to those of previously characterized ATPase6
mutants also modeled in the E. coli enzyme. The L259R change produced a fully
assembled ECF(1)F(0) which had no significant ATP hydrolysis, ATP synthesis or
proton pumping functions. This is very different from previously described human 
ATPase6 mutations. The presence of Arg at position 259 in subunit a did not make 
membranes permeable to protons. We conclude that the mutation inhibits
functioning by blocking the rotary motor action of the enzyme.
