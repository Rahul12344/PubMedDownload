Whole-cell biocatalyst has the potential to become a cost-effective alternative
to conventional enzyme methods for solving ecological and energy issues. However,
cytosolic-expressing biocatalyst systems are critically disadvantaged due to the 
low permeability of the cell membrane. To overcome substrate transport barrier,
periplasmic secretion and surface display biocatalysts were developed by
expressing signal peptides or anchor proteins in Escherichia coli. In this work, 
six carriers were compared in regard to whole-cell activity of methyl parathion
hydrolase (MPH). Our results indicate that the surface display systems yielded
one to three times whole-cell activity than the periplasmic secretion systems.
Although periplasmic secretion systems showed generally more stable than surface 
display systems, surface display appeared more suitable for whole-cell
biocatalyst. It should note that the applicability of the DsbA/PhoA/AIDA-I leader
to MPH expression is shown here for the first time. In addition, the result
provided a useful reference for other whole-cell biocatalyst selection.
