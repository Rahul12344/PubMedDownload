Short chain volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from acetic acid (C2) to valeric acid
(C5) are important starting chemicals for chemical industry. The production of
VFAs from rejected resources (organic residues) using self-sustaining
technologies has an exciting potential in supporting the US chemical industry to 
achieve the goal that 20% of chemicals produced in the USA will be bio-based.
Acidogenic anaerobic digestion as a robust, well-established, and versatile
biological technology can be applied as an alternative approach for the
valorization of organic residues (municipal, agricultural, and industrial wastes)
by the production of VFAs. In a typical acidogenic anaerobic digestion operation,
residue type, pretreatment, reactor operation, and VFA recovery are the key
factors that influence VFA production. This chapter discusses these factors and
provides an experimental approach of VFA production from organic residues.
