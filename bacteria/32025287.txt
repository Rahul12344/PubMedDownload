conduction through the channel.

The Sec translocon provides a polypeptide-conducting channel, which is insulated 
from the hydrophobic lipidic environment of the membrane, for translocation of
hydrophilic passenger polypeptides. Its lateral gate allows a downstream
hydrophobic segment (stop-transfer sequence) to exit the channel laterally for
integration into the lipid phase. We note that this channel model only partly
accounts for the translocon function. The other essential role of translocon is
to facilitate de novo insertion of the N-terminal topogenic segment of a
substrate polypeptide into the membrane. Recent structural studies suggest that
de novo insertion does not use the polypeptide-conducting channel; instead, it
takes place directly at the lateral gate, which is prone to opening. We propose
that the de novo insertion process, in concept, is similar to that of insertases 
(such as YidC in bacteria and EMC3 in eukaryotes), in which an intramembrane
surface of the machinery provides the halfway point of insertion.
