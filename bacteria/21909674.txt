With the aim of isolating new microbes capable of producing strong antimicrobial 
substances, strain CS392 was screened from 700 soil isolates preserved in our
laboratory. The strain was related to genus Streptomyces based on various
characteristics. Three highly active antimicrobial compounds, C1, C2 and C3,
produced by the strain were purified by solvent extraction followed by silica gel
column chromatography. These compounds were highly active against various
Gram-positive resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among three, C3 was the most active
against MRSA and VRSA with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 μg/ml
while C2 and C3 had MIC values of 4 μg/ml for the strains. In case of Bacillus
subtilis ATCC6633, C1 and C3 were more effective with MIC values of 0.5 μg/ml
than C2 with MIC of 2 μg/ml. Those antibiotics were variably active (MIC of 4-32 
μg/ml) against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212,
Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341 and VRE.
