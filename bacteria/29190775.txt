Periodontal disease is caused by dental plaque biofilms. Fusobacterium nucleatum 
is an important periodontal pathogen involved in the development of bacterial
complexity in dental plaque biofilms. Human gingival fibroblasts (GFs) act as the
first line of defense against oral microorganisms and locally orchestrate immune 
responses by triggering the production of reactive oxygen species and
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8). The frequency and severity of
periodontal diseases is known to increase in elderly subjects. However, despite
several studies exploring the effects of aging in periodontal disease, the
underlying mechanisms through which aging affects the interaction between F.
nucleatum and human GFs remain unclear. To identify genes affected by infection, 
aging, or both, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis using GFs isolated from a single
healthy donor that were passaged for a short period of time (P4) 'young GFs' or
for longer period of time (P22) 'old GFs', and infected or not with F. nucleatum.
Comparing F. nucleatum-infected and uninfected GF(P4) cells the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in host defense mechanisms (i.e., immune
responses and defense responses), whereas comparing F. nucleatum-infected and
uninfected GF(P22) cells the DEGs were involved in cell maintenance (i.e., TGF-Î² 
signaling, skeletal development). Most DEGs in F. nucleatum-infected GF(P22)
cells were downregulated (85%) and were significantly associated with host
defense responses such as inflammatory responses, when compared to the DEGs in F.
nucleatum-infected GF(P4) cells. Five genes (GADD45b, KLF10, CSRNP1, ID1, and
TM4SF1) were upregulated in response to F. nucleatum infection; however, this
effect was only seen in GF(P22) cells. The genes identified here appear to
interact with each other in a network associated with free radical scavenging,
cell cycle, and cancer; therefore, they could be potential candidates involved in
the aged GF's response to F. nucleatum infection. Further studies are needed to
confirm these observations.
