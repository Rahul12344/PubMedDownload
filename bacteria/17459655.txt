We used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to not only investigate the mRNA levels of 
anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) and 2 (ANTXR2) in the murine J774A.1 macrophage
cells and different tissues of mice, but also evaluate the effect of anthrax
edema toxin and Bacillus anthracis Sterne spores on the expression of mRNA of
these receptors. The mRNA transcripts of both receptors were detected in J774A.1 
cells and mouse tissues such as the lung, heart, kidney, spleen, stomach,
jejunum, brain, skeleton muscle, and skin. The ANTXR2 mRNA level was
significantly higher than that of ANTXR1 in J774A.1 cells and all tissues
examined. The mRNA expression of both receptors in the lung was the highest among
the tissues evaluated. Interestingly, the mRNA expression of both receptors in
J774A.1 cells was upregulated by edema toxin. In addition, ANTXR mRNA expression 
in the lung was downregulated after subcutaneous inoculation of B. anthracis
Sterne spores as well as after intranasal administration of anthrax toxin-based
vaccine BioThrax. These results suggest that anthrax edema toxin and B. anthracis
Sterne spore are involved in the ANTXR mRNA regulation in host cells.
