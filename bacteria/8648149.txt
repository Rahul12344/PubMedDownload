Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BP]) is contained within the
azurophilic granules of neutrophils and is able to neutralize endotoxin and kill 
Gram-negative bacteria. TNF has been implicated as a mediator of
endotoxin-induced neutrophil degranulation. To assess the role of TNF in the
elevated BPI levels during sepsis, the following studies were performed. 1) In 31
consecutive patients with sepsis syndrome, plasma BPI levels were markedly
elevated compared with those in healthy controls, but showed no correlation with 
simultaneously measured TNF concentrations. 2) In four healthy men, i.v.
injection of recombinant human TNF (50 microg/m2) induced a rapid rise in plasma 
BPI levels. 3) In eight normal subjects, i.v. administration of Escherichia coli 
endotoxin (4 ng/kg) elicited subsequent increases in the plasma concentrations of
TNF and BPI. 4) Eight healthy chimpanzees were investigated after i.v. injection 
of endotoxin (4 ng/kg); four animals received endotoxin only, and four animals
received an anti-TNF mAb simultaneously. Although anti-TNF completely prevented
the endotoxin-induced appearance of TNF activity, the rise in BPI levels remained
unaltered. These results suggest that TNF is not critical for the release of BPI 
from neutrophils during experimental endotoxemia or clinical sepsis.
