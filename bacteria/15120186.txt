Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated cytotoxicity is initiated in natural killer (NK) cells
through ligation of their activating receptors. The CD16 receptor has been shown 
to induce FasL expression and cytotoxicity in NK cells. In this study, we made
the novel observation that FasL expression was upregulated in NKL cells
stimulated through 2B4 and LFA-1 activating receptors, implying a role for
FasL-mediated cytotoxicity early in the immune response. Coligation with
CD94/NKG2A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I inhibitory receptor did not
block the induced FasL expression; therefore, these opposing pathways appear to
function independently. We also showed, however, that FasL-mediated cytotoxicity 
was downregulated in CD94/NKG2A-expressing LAK cells in response to the HLA-E
ligand, suggesting a mechanism by which aberrant cells expressing class I may
evade FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. Thus we show for the first time that 2B4,
LFA-1, and CD94/NKG2A receptors are involved in modulating FasL expression and,
therefore, cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells.
