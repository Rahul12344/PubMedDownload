Fresh produce is often a source of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)
outbreaks. Fimbriae are extracellular structures involved in cell-to-cell
attachment and surface colonisation. F9 (Fml) fimbriae have been shown to be
expressed at temperatures lower than 37 °C, implying a function beyond the
mammalian host. We demonstrate that F9 fimbriae recognize plant cell wall
hemicellulose, specifically galactosylated side chains of xyloglucan, using
glycan arrays. E. coli expressing F9 fimbriae had a positive advantage for
adherence to spinach hemicellulose extract and tissues, which have galactosylated
oligosaccharides as recognized by LM24 and LM25 antibodies. As fimbriae are
multimeric structures with a molecular pattern, we investigated whether F9
fimbriae could induce a transcriptional response in model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, compared with flagella and another fimbrial type, E. coli common pilus 
(ECP), using DNA microarrays. F9 induced the differential expression of 435
genes, including genes involved in the plant defence response. The expression of 
F9 at environmentally relevant temperatures and its recognition of plant
xyloglucan adds to the suite of adhesins EHEC has available to exploit the plant 
niche.
