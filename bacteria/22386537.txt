Memory CD4 T cells must provide robust protection for an organism while still
maintaining self-tolerance. Superantigens reveal a memory cell-specific
regulatory pathway, by which signaling through the TCR can lead to clonal
tolerance (anergy). Here we show that the src kinase Fyn is a critical regulator 
of anergy in murine memory CD4 T cells induced by the bacterial superantigen
staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Exposure to SEB results in impaired TCR
signaling due to failed CD3/ZAP-70 complex formation. Further, signal
transduction through the TCR remains similarly blocked when anergic memory cells 
are subsequently exposed to agonist peptide antigen. Pharmacological inhibition
or genetic elimination of Fyn kinase reverses memory cell anergy, resulting in
SEB-induced cell proliferation. The mechanism underlying impaired TCR signaling
and subsequent memory cell anergy must involve a Fyn signaling pathway given that
the suppression of Fyn activity restores CD3/ZAP-70 complex formation and TCR
proximal signaling.
