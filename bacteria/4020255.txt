Histochemical study of cartilage autografts in tympanoplasty.

Elwany S.

Histochemical examination of lactic dehydrogenase enzyme activity was used to
detect the effect of certain factors on the viability of cartilage autografts in 
the middle ear. The study shows that the presence of perichondrium on both sides 
of the strut and placing the lateral end of the strut increase the chance of
survival of chondrocytes. On the other hand, middle ear infection has a very bad 
effect on the viability of chondrocytes. The length of the strut and the presence
of silastic film in the middle ear have been found to be unimportant as far as
the survival of the graft is concerned.
