Effective treatment of cancer cells with chemotherapeutic drugs relies on their
ability to induce cell death, making the discovery of their mechanisms of action 
crucial. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), used in the treatment of promyelocytic
leukemia (PML), triggers cell death in several solid tumor cell lines including
ovarian carcinomas. While As(2)O(3) is remarkably cytotoxic in human ovarian
cancer cells, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. We recently
investigated the effects of As(2)O(3) on several transforming growth factor-β
(TGFβ) signaling mediators to better understand its cell death mechanism. Indeed,
dysregulated (TGFβ) signaling is typical of ovarian cancers. Based on our
findings, we propose that As(2)O(3) induces a Beclin 1-independent autophagic
pathway in ovarian carcinoma cells by modulating SnoN/SkiL expression,
implicating SnoN as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancers.
