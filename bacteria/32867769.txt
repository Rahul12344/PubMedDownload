BACKGROUND: Selection pressure from continued exposure to insecticides drives
development of insecticide resistance and changes in resting behaviour of malaria
vectors. There is need to understand how resistance drives changes in resting
behaviour within vector species. The association between insecticide resistance
and resting behaviour of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in Northern Ghana
was examined.
METHODS: F1 progenies from adult mosquitoes collected indoors and outdoors were
exposed to DDT, deltamethrin, malathion and bendiocarb using WHO insecticide
susceptibility tests. Insecticide resistance markers including voltage-gated
sodium channel (Vgsc)-1014F, Vgsc-1014S, Vgsc-1575Y, glutathione-S-transferase
epsilon 2 (GSTe2)-114T and acetylcholinesterase (Ace1)-119S, as well as blood
meal sources were investigated using PCR methods. Activities of metabolic
enzymes, acetylcholine esterase (AChE), non-specific β-esterases,
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and monooxygenases were measured from unexposed
F1 progenies using microplate assays.
RESULTS: Susceptibility of Anopheles coluzzii to deltamethrin 24 h post-exposure 
was significantly higher in indoor (mortality = 5%) than outdoor
(mortality = 2.5%) populations (P = 0.02). Mosquitoes were fully susceptible to
malathion (mortality: indoor = 98%, outdoor = 100%). Susceptibility to DDT was
significantly higher in outdoor (mortality = 9%) than indoor (mortality = 0%)
mosquitoes (P = 0.006). Mosquitoes were also found with suspected resistance to
bendiocarb but mortality was not statistically different (mortality:
indoor = 90%, outdoor = 95%. P = 0.30). Frequencies of all resistance alleles
were higher in F1 outdoor (0.11-0.85) than indoor (0.04-0.65) mosquito
populations, while Vgsc-1014F in F0 An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s) was
significantly associated with outdoor-resting behaviour (P = 0.01). Activities of
non-specific β-esterase enzymes were significantly higher in outdoor than indoor 
mosquitoes (Mean enzyme activity: Outdoor = : 1.70/mg protein; Indoor = 1.35/mg
protein. P < 0.0001). AChE activity was also more elevated in outdoor (0.62/mg
protein) than indoor (0.57/mg protein) mosquitoes but this was not significant
(P = 0.08). Human blood index (HBI) was predominantly detected in indoor (18%)
than outdoor mosquito populations (3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall results did not establish that there was a significant
preference of resistant malaria vectors to solely rest indoors or outdoors, but
varied depending on the resistant alleles present. Phenotypic resistance was
higher in indoor than outdoor-resting mosquitoes, but genotypic and metabolic
resistance levels were higher in outdoor than the indoor populations. Continued
monitoring of changes in resting behaviour within An. gambiae s.l. populations is
recommended.
