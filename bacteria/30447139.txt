Seventeen novel 2,5-disubstituted benzimidazole derivatives were designed,
synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activities. The tested
compounds B1-B4 and C2-C6 exhibited not only good antifungal activity but also
favorable broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Also, the lowest MIC of
antibacterial and antifungal activity was 2 μg/mL and 4 μg/mL, respectively. It
suggested that the structure of compound including the different substituent and 
its sites directly affected the efficacy of the synthesized compounds.
