Bahamaolide A, a new macrocyclic lactone isolated from the culture of marine
actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNQ343, was evaluated for its inhibitory activity
toward isocitrate lyase (ICL) from Candida albicans. These studies led to the
identification of bahamaolide A as a potent ICL inhibitor with IC50 value of
11.82 μM. The growth phenotype of ICL deletion mutants and quantitative RT-PCR
analyses indicated that this compound inhibits the ICL mRNA expression in C.
albicans under C2-carbon-utilizing conditions. The present data highlight the
potential for bahamaolide A treatment of C. albicans infections via inhibition of
ICL activity.
