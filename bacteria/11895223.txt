OBJECTIVES: Graves' disease is associated with different human leucocyte antigen 
(HLA) genes in different populations. This studywasdesigned to examinethe HLA
class II associations with Graves' disease in Jamaicans.
PATIENTS: One hundred and six Jamaicans with Graves' disease and 104 controls.
DESIGN: Oligotyping for HLA-DRB1, DRB3, DQA1 and DQB1 alleles was performed using
the polymerase chain reaction sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (PCR-SSOP) 
technique. RESULTS The frequency of HLA-DRB3 *0101 was increased significantly in
the patients compared to controls (38.7% vs. 19.2%; RR = 2.72; Pc < 0.015). The
protective alleles for Graves' disease were DRB1 *0901 (0.9% vs. 20.2%; RR =
0.04; Pc < 0.001), DRB1*1001 (0.0% vs. 11%; RR = 0.0%; Pc < 0.01) and DRB4 *0101 
(0.0% vs. 12.5%; RR = 0.0; Pc < 0.05). A high female to male ratio of Graves'
disease, 25 :1, was observed. Other associated autoimmune diseases were rare and 
no significant HLA class II associations were found with clinical markers of
disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Jamaican patients with Graves' disease share the DRB3 *0101
susceptible allele and the DRB4 *01 protective allele but not the susceptible
haplotype DRB1 *0301, DRB3*0101, DQA1*0501 with Caucasians.
