KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a
desmoplastic response that promotes hypovascularity, immunosuppression, and
resistance to chemo- and immunotherapies. We show that a combination of MEK and
CDK4/6 inhibitors that target KRAS-directed oncogenic signaling can suppress PDAC
proliferation through induction of retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated
senescence. In preclinical mouse models of PDAC, this senescence-inducing therapy
produces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes
pro-angiogenic factors that promote tumor vascularization, which in turn enhances
drug delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic gemcitabine chemotherapy. In addition,
SASP-mediated endothelial cell activation stimulates the accumulation of CD8+
T cells into otherwise immunologically "cold" tumors, sensitizing tumors to PD-1 
checkpoint blockade. Therefore, in PDAC models, therapy-induced senescence can
establish emergent susceptibilities to otherwise ineffective chemo- and
immunotherapies through SASP-dependent effects on the tumor vasculature and
immune system.
