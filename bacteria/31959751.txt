Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are prokaryotic organelles consisting of a
protein shell and an encapsulated enzymatic core. BMCs are involved in several
biochemical processes, such as choline, glycerol and ethanolamine degradation and
carbon fixation. Since non-native enzymes can also be encapsulated in BMCs, an
improved understanding of BMC shell assembly and encapsulation processes could be
useful for synthetic biology applications. Here we report the isolation and
recombinant expression of BMC structural genes from the Klebsiella pneumoniae
GRM2 locus, the investigation of mechanisms behind encapsulation of the core
enzymes, and the characterization of shell particles by cryo-EM. We conclude that
the enzymatic core is encapsulated in a hierarchical manner and that the CutC
choline lyase may play a secondary role as an adaptor protein. We also present a 
cryo-EM structure of a pT = 4 quasi-symmetric icosahedral shell particle at 3.3 Å
resolution, and demonstrate variability among the minor shell forms.
