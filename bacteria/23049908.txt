To determine the signaling pathways leading from Met activation to metastasis and
poor prognosis, we measured the kinetic gene alterations in breast cancer cell
lines in response to HGF/SF. Using a network inference tool we analyzed the
putative protein-protein interaction pathways leading from Met to these genes and
studied their specificity to Met and prognostic potential. We identified a Met
kinetic signature consisting of 131 genes. The signature correlates with Met
activation and with response to anti-Met therapy (p<0.005) in in-vitro models. It
also identifies breast cancer patients who are at high risk to develop an
aggressive disease in six large published breast cancer patient cohorts (p<0.01, 
N>1000). Moreover, we have identified novel putative Met pathways, which
correlate with Met activity and patient prognosis. This signature may facilitate 
personalized therapy by identifying patients who will respond to anti-Met
therapy. Moreover, this novel approach may be applied for other tyrosine kinases 
and other malignancies.
