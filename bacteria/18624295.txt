Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a special subset of alphabeta T cells
with invariant TCR, which recognize alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)
presented by CD1d. In addition to signals through the invariant TCR upon
stimulation with alpha-GalCer, costimulatory signals, such as signals through
CD28 and OX40, are indispensable for full activation of iNKT cells. In this
study, we investigated the functions of a well-known costimulatory molecule,
glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor (GITR), on Ag-induced iNKT cell activation.
Unexpectedly, engagement of GITR by agonistic mAb DTA-1 suppressed proliferation 
and cytokine production of iNKT cells upon alpha-GalCer stimulation. In addition,
GITR signals in iNKT cells during only the Ag-priming phase was sufficient to
inhibit the iNKT cell activation. Consistent with these results, the
GITR-deficient iNKT cells showed enhanced proliferation and increased cytokine
production upon alpha-GalCer stimulation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 
the in vivo administration of alpha-GalCer suppressed tumor metastasis more
efficiently in GITR-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. Collectively, GITR
plays a co-inhibitory role in Ag-induced iNKT cell activation.
