CRISPR-Cas9-based screening with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries has emerged
as a revolutionary tool for comprehensive analysis of genetic elements. However, 
genome-scale sgRNA libraries are currently available only in a few model
organisms. The traditional approach is to synthesize thousands to tens of
thousands of sgRNAs, which is laborious and expensive. We have developed a simple
method, RELATe (restriction/ligation coupled with Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation), to generate sgRNA libraries from 10 μg of genomic DNA, targeting
over 98% of the protein-coding genes in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus
neoformans Functional screens identified 142 potential C. neoformans genes
contributing to blood-brain barrier penetration. We selected two cryptococcal
genes, SFP1 and WDR1, for a proof-of-concept demonstration that RELATe-identified
genes are relevant to C. neoformans central nervous system infection. Our RELATe 
method can be used in many other fungal species and is powerful and
cost-effective for genome-wide high-throughput screening for elucidating
functional genomics.
