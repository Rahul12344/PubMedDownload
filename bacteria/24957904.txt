BACKGROUND: The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) is a
chloride channel that primarily resides in airway epithelial cells. Decreased
CFTR expression and/or function lead to impaired airway surface liquid (ASL)
volume homeostasis, resulting in accumulation of mucus, reduced clearance of
bacteria, and chronic infection and inflammation.
METHODS: Expression of CFTR and the cigarette smoke metal content were assessed
in lung samples of controls and COPD patients with established GOLD stage 4. CFTR
protein and mRNA were quantified by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR,
respectively. Metals present in lung samples were quantified by ICP-AES. The
effect of cigarette smoke on down-regulation of CFTR expression and function was 
assessed using primary human airway epithelial cells. The role of leading
metal(s) found in lung samples of GOLD 4 COPD patients involved in the alteration
of CFTR was confirmed by exposing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE14o- to
metal-depleted cigarette smoke extracts.
RESULTS: We found that CFTR expression is reduced in the lungs of GOLD 4 COPD
patients, especially in bronchial epithelial cells. Assessment of metals present 
in lung samples revealed that cadmium and manganese were significantly higher in 
GOLD 4 COPD patients when compared to control smokers (GOLD 0). Primary human
airway epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke resulted in decreased
expression of CFTR protein and reduced airway surface liquid height.
16HBE14o-cells exposed to cigarette smoke also exhibited reduced levels of CFTR
protein and mRNA. Removal and/or addition of metals to cigarette smoke extracts
before exposure established their role in decrease of CFTR in airway epithelial
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CFTR expression is reduced in the lungs of patients with severe
COPD. This effect is associated with the accumulation of cadmium and manganese
suggesting a role for these metals in the pathogenesis of COPD.
