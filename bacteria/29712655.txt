A collection of 126 pigs was screened for carriage of colistin-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae in a farm in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Out of this collection,
eight colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates were recovered, including one 
from Minas Gerais State producing a new MCR-3 variant (MCR-3.12). Analysis of the
lipopolysaccharide revealed that MCR-3.12 had a function similar to that of MCR-1
and MCR-2 as a result of the addition of a phosphoethanolamine group to the lipid
A moiety. Genetic analysis showed that the mcr-3.12 gene was carried by an
IncA/C2 plasmid and was embedded in an original genetic environment. This study
reports the occurrence of the MCR-3-like determinant in South America and is the 
first to demonstrate the functionality of this group of enzymes as a
phosphoethanolamine transferase.
