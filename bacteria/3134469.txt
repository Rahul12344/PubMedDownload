From June 1983 to May 1986, thirteen carcasses of stranded beluga whales from a
polluted area of the St. Lawrence River, Canada were necropsied. High performance
liquid chromatography was performed on the brains of three other animals to
determine concentrations of benzo a pyrene (BaP). Two juvenile animals had severe
multisystemic lesions one of which, a severe necrotizing dermatitis, was
associated with a Herpesvirus-like particle. Four adults had five varieties of
tumours. An adult had a systemic nocardiosis and a juvenile was affected ty a non
0:1 Vibrio cholerae septicemia. High concentrations of BaP adducts were found in 
the brains which were analyzed. Occurrence of BaP adducts in the brain of three
whales of this population coincides with the high incidence of tumours. This and 
the previous finding of high concentrations of organochlorine in the tissues of
these animals suggest an important role of industrial contaminants in the recent 
decrease of this population.
