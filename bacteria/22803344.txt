OBJECTIVE: We constructed a recombinant Escherichia coli strain for butanol
production by cloning the cDNA sequence of the key butanol synthetic pathway
genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824.
METHODS: We amplified the genes of thil, adhE2 and BCS operon by PCR with C.
acetobutylicum ATCC824 genome as a template. We constructed the recombinant
strain E. coli pBAT (BCS operon-adhE2-thil/pTrc99a/MG1655). We used 0.1 mmol/l
Isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce the recombinant E. coli
pBAT for 5 h for recombinant protein expression. We measured acetyl-CoA
acetyltransferase (THL), beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBD),
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (CRT), butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD) and
butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (BYDH)/butanol dehydrogenase (BDH) activities in E.
coli MG1655 and E. coli pBAT. The fermentation of E. coli pBAT was done in flask 
in aerobic, micro-aerobic and anaerobic mode separately.
RESULTS: In the recombinant E. coli pBAT, THL activity was 0.160 U/mg protein,
about 30 times higher than that of E. coli MG1655. HBD activity was 5 times
higher than that of E. coli MG1655. CRT activity was 1.53 U/mg protein whereas
not detectable in E. coli MG1655. BCD activity was about 32 times higher than
that of E. coli MG1655. In addition, the results show that n-butanol could be
produced under anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions. The maximum n-buntanol
concentration of 84 mg/l was detected in cultivation broth.
CONCLUSION: The key genes of butanol synthetic pathway were expressed in E. coli 
and the recombinant strains would offer an alternative strategy for butanol
biosynthesis.
