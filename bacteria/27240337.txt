Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem and alternative therapeutic
approaches are needed. Considering the high prevalence of lung tuberculosis (80% 
of cases), the pulmonary delivery of antitubercular drugs in a carrier system
capable of reaching the alveoli, being recognised and phagocytosed by alveolar
macrophages (mycobacterium hosts), would be a significant improvement to current 
oral drug regimens. Locust bean gum (LBG) is a polysaccharide composed of
galactose and mannose residues, which may favour specific recognition by
macrophages and potentiate phagocytosis. LBG microparticles produced by
spray-drying are reported herein for the first time, incorporating either
isoniazid or rifabutin, first-line antitubercular drugs (association efficiencies
>82%). Microparticles have adequate theoretical properties for deep lung delivery
(aerodynamic diameters between 1.15 and 1.67 μm). The cytotoxic evaluation in
lung epithelial cells (A549 cells) and macrophages (THP-1 cells) revealed a toxic
effect from rifabutin-loaded microparticles at the highest concentrations, but we
may consider that these were very high comparing with in vivo conditions. LBG
microparticles further evidenced strong ability to be captured by macrophages
(percentage of phagocytosis >94%). Overall, the obtained data indicated the
potential of the proposed system for tuberculosis therapy.
