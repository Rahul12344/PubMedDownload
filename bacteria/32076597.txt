Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-based therapies offer a promising, targeted
approach to effectively treat relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies.
However, the treatment-related toxicity defined as cytokine-release syndrome
(CRS) often develops in patients, and if uncontrolled, can be fatal. Grading
systems have now been developed to further characterize and objectify clinical
findings in order to provide algorithm-based guidance on CRS-related treatment
decisions. The pharmacological treatments associated with these algorithms
suppress inflammation through a variety of mechanisms and are paramount to
improving the safety profile of CAR-based therapies. However, fatalities are
still occurring, and there are downsides to these treatments, including the
possibility of disrupting CAR-T cell persistence. This review article will
describe the clinical presentation and current management of CRS, and through our
now deeper understanding of downstream signaling pathways, will provide a
molecular framework to formulate new hypotheses regarding clinical applications
to contain proinflammatory cytokines responsible for CRS.
