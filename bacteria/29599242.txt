Infectious diseases rarely end in extinction. Yet the mechanisms that explain how
epidemics subside are difficult to pinpoint. We investigated host-pathogen
interactions after the emergence of a lethal fungal pathogen in a tropical
amphibian assemblage. Some amphibian host species are recovering, but the
pathogen is still present and is as pathogenic today as it was almost a decade
ago. In addition, some species have defenses that are more effective now than
they were before the epidemic. These results suggest that host recoveries are not
caused by pathogen attenuation and may be due to shifts in host responses. Our
findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying disease transitions,
which are increasingly important to understand in an era of emerging infectious
diseases and unprecedented global pandemics.
