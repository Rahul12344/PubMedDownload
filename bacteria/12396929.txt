In October 2001, two envelopes containing Bacillus anthracis spores were
processed at the Washington, D.C., Processing and Distribution Center of the U.S.
Postal Service; inhalational anthrax developed in four workers at this facility. 
More than 2,000 workers were advised to complete 60 days of postexposure
prophylaxis to prevent inhalational anthrax. Interventions to promote adherence
were carried out to support workers, and qualitative information was collected to
evaluate our interventions. A quantitative survey was administered to a
convenience sample of workers to assess factors influencing adherence. No anthrax
infections developed in any workers involved in the interventions or interviews. 
Of 245 workers, 98 (40%) reported full adherence to prophylaxis, and 45 (18%) had
completely discontinued it. Anxiety and experiencing adverse effects to
prophylaxis, as well as being <45 years old were risk factors for discontinuing
prophylaxis. Interventions, especially frequent visits by public health staff,
proved effective in supporting adherence.
