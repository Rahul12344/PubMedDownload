Schwannomas are common, highly morbid and medically untreatable tumors that can
arise in patients with germ line as well as somatic mutations in
neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). These mutations most commonly result in the loss 
of function of the NF2-encoded protein, Merlin. Little is known about how Merlin 
functions endogenously as a tumor suppressor and how its loss leads to oncogenic 
transformation in Schwann cells (SCs). Here, we identify nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-inducing kinase (NIK) as 
a potential drug target driving NF-κB signaling and Merlin-deficient schwannoma
genesis. Using a genomic approach to profile aberrant tumor signaling pathways,
we describe multiple upregulated NF-κB signaling elements in human and murine
schwannomas, leading us to identify a caspase-cleaved, proteasome-resistant NIK
kinase domain fragment that amplifies pathogenic NF-κB signaling.
Lentiviral-mediated transduction of this NIK fragment into normal SCs promotes
proliferation, survival, and adhesion while inducing schwannoma formation in a
novel in vivo orthotopic transplant model. Furthermore, we describe an
NF-κB-potentiated hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to MET proto-oncogene receptor
tyrosine kinase (c-Met) autocrine feed-forward loop promoting SC proliferation.
These innovative studies identify a novel signaling axis underlying schwannoma
formation, revealing new and potentially druggable schwannoma vulnerabilities
with future therapeutic potential.
