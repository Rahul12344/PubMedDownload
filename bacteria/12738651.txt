The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is an antibiotic- and
endotoxin-neutralizing protein of granulocytes and epithelial cells. Constitutive
expression of BPI, which increases upon interleukin 4 stimulation, by human
dermal fibroblast was demonstrated, suggesting an important role of BPI in
gram-negative bacterial clearance and a dampened response to endotoxin in the
skin.
