The innate immune system plays an important role in host defense against
pathogenic infections. In the innate immune system, several families of innate
pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like
receptors, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and DNA receptors (cytosolic sensors for
DNA), are known to play vital roles in detecting and responding to various
pathogens. In this study, we identified 29 NLRs in turbot including 4 NLRs from
subfamily A: NOD1, NOD2, CIITA, NLRC5, 1 NLR from subfamily B: NLRB1, 21 NLRs
from subfamily C: NLR-C3.1∼NLRC3.21, 1 from NLRX subfamily, and two that do not
fall within these subfamilies: APAF1, NWD1. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
these NLR genes were clearly divided into five subfamilies. Protein-protein
interaction network analysis showed that some of these NLR genes shared same
interacting genes and might participate in signal transductions associated with
immunity. The evolutionary pressure selection analysis showed that the Ka/Ks
ratios for all detected NLR genes were much less than one, implying more
synonymous changes than non-synonymous changes. In addition, tissue expression
analysis showed that the relative higher expression levels were observed in gill,
skin and intestine. Meanwhile, NLR genes expression after bacterial infection
results showed that most NLR genes participated in the process of defense of V.
anguillarum and A. salmonicida infections in mucosal tissues. Taken together,
identification and expression profiling analysis of NLR genes can provide
valuable information for further functional characterization of these genes in
turbot.
