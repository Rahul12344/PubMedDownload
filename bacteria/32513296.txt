BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) has one of the worst 5-year survival rates of all 
cancers. While genomic studies of the disease have been performed, alterations in
the non-coding regulatory regions of GBM have largely remained unexplored. We
apply whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify non-coding mutations, with
regulatory potential in GBM, under the hypothesis that regions of evolutionary
constraint are likely to be functional, and somatic mutations are likely more
damaging than in unconstrained regions.
RESULTS: We validate our GBM cohort, finding similar copy number aberrations and 
mutated genes based on coding mutations as previous studies. Performing analysis 
on non-coding constraint mutations and their position relative to nearby genes,
we find a significant enrichment of non-coding constraint mutations in the
neighborhood of 78 genes that have previously been implicated in GBM. Among them,
SEMA3C and DYNC1I1 show the highest frequencies of alterations, with multiple
mutations overlapping transcription factor binding sites. We find that a
non-coding constraint mutation in the SEMA3C promoter reduces the DNA binding
capacity of the region. We also identify 1776 other genes enriched for non-coding
constraint mutations with likely regulatory potential, providing additional
candidate GBM genes. The mutations in the top four genes, DLX5, DLX6, FOXA1, and 
ISL1, are distributed over promoters, UTRs, and multiple transcription factor
binding sites.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that non-coding constraint mutations could
play an essential role in GBM, underscoring the need to connect non-coding
genomic variation to biological function and disease pathology.
