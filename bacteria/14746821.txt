Cryopreservation is the accepted method for long-term storage of cord blood (CB) 
cells. We evaluated the effects of using different cooling rates (1, 5, 7.5 and
10 degrees C/min) on CB cell allostimulatory and alloproliferative function,
antigen expression and clonogenic potential. Significant decreases
(P<0.001-0.003) in viable cell recovery observed between fresh CB cells and CB
cells cryopreserved at each cooling rate tested. Reductions in clonogenic
potential of CB cells cryopreserved at cooling rates of 1, 5, 7.5 and 10 degrees 
C/min were 44%, 76%, 88% and 93% respectively, compared to fresh controls. FACS
analysis indicated no changes in percentages CD34+ cells or lymphocytes. Two sets
of mixed lymphocyte reactions were carried out for each CB sample. It was
observed that allostimulatory and alloproliferative function varied following
cryopreservation at different cooling rates (1 and 5 degrees C/min).
Interestingly, there was a significant decrease (P<0.001-0.04) in the
alloproliferative function of six of the seven CB samples following
cryopreservation using a cooling rate of 5 degrees C/min. Cooling rates between 1
and 5 degrees C/min may provide immunomodulation of CB with maintenance of
haematopoietic progenitor cells function.
