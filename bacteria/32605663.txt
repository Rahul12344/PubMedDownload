Erratum in
    Microbiome. 2020 Aug 20;8(1):119.

The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades
and has become a topic of great scientific and public interest. As a result of
this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear
commonly agreed definition of the term "microbiome." Moreover, a consensus on
best practices in microbiome research is missing. Recently, a panel of
international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the
European-funded MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 
leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more than a hundred experts from all
over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This
article excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey
embedded in a short historical introduction and future outlook. We propose a
definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive
description of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of 
novel recommendations considering the latest technological developments and
research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and
provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the
heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and
resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and
functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of
microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome. These broad
definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve
standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting
point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a more rapid transfer of 
knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are
important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes
in the field of planetary health, for which the understanding of microbiomes
might play a key role. Video Abstract.
