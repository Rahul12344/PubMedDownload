BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a crucial
virulence factor strongly associated with chronic periodontitis which is the
primary cause of tooth loss in adults. It exhibits remarkable heterogeneity
containing tetra-(LPS(1435/1449)) and penta-(LPS(1690)) acylated lipid A
structures. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) as the main resident cells of human
gingiva play a key role in regulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
contribute to periodontal homeostasis. This study investigated the expression and
regulation of MMPs1-3 and tissue inhibitors of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) in HGFs in response
to P. gingivalis LPS(1435/1449) and LPS(1690) and hexa-acylated E. coli LPS as a 
reference. The expression of MMPs 1-3 and TIMP-1 was evaluated by real-time PCR
and ELISA.
RESULTS: The MMP-3 mRNA and protein were highly upregulated in P. gingivalis
LPS(1690)- and E. coli LPS-treated cells, whereas no induction was observed in P.
gingivalis LPS(1435/1449)-treated cells. On the contrary, the expression of MMP-1
and -2 was not significantly affected by P. gingivalis LPS lipid A heterogeneity.
The TIMP-1 mRNA was upregulated in P. gingivalis LPS(1435/1449)- and E. coli
LPS-treated cells. Next, signal transduction pathways involved in P. gingivalis
LPS-induced expression of MMP-3 were examined by blocking assays. Blockage of p38
MAPK and ERK significantly inhibited P. gingivalis LPS(1690)-induced MMP-3
expression in HGFs.
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that the heterogeneous lipid A
structures of P. gingivalis LPS differentially modulate the expression of MMP-3
in HGFs, which may play a role in periodontal pathogenesis.
