Background: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) rarely involves the spine primarily, and
if it does, is almost always associated with advanced disease.
Case Presentation: An 8-year-old male presented with a one month history of
nuchal pain followed by stiffness and rapidly progressive upper and lower limb
weakness. He was seronegative for HIV and EBV. Computed tomography myelogram and 
magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine showed a long
segment (C2 to T1) complete absence of cerebrospinal fluid signal and mildly
enhancing intradural extramedullary lesion with an extradural and right
paravertebral muscle extension, respectively. Post-excision biopsy histopathology
and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of a CD 10+, CD20+, CD45+,
Bcl-2+, Ki67+, and EBER in situ hybridization for EBV negative, Burkitt's
lymphoma (BL). Cytogenetic analysis showed chromosomal translocations of 8q24.
CHOP plus intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate was given as chemotherapy regimen.
1.8 grays (Gy) per fraction to the local area for an average total dose of 36 Gy 
was given with a resultant significant clinical improvement.
Conclusion: Though considered uncommon spinal canal tumors, BL should be in the
differential diagnosis, if multilevel involvement is demonstrated on imaging.
