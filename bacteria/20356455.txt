CpG-DNA, which contains unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in the context of specific
sequences, has remarkable and diverse immunological effects, including induction 
of proinflammatory cytokine expression and regulation of the Th1/Th2 immune
response. Here, we examined the immunostimulatory activities of double-stranded
(ds) CpG-DNA in the human B cell line RPMI8226. To investigate whether dsCpG-DNA 
stimulates immune cells, we constructed a plasmid containing repeated dsCpG-DNA
and produced dsCpG-DNA by PCR amplification and EcoR I digestion. PCR-amplified
dsCpG-DNA alone did not have immmunostimulatory activity. However, dsCpGDNA
encapsulated with lipofectin induced IL-8 promoter activation, HLA-DRA
expression, and IL-8 expression in a CG sequence- independent manner. The effects
of encapsulated dsCpGDNA were independent of minor endotoxin contamination. These
findings suggest the potential use of dsCpG-DNA as a therapy for immune response 
regulation.
