Little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of
halitosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of
adrenaline (ADR), noradrenaline (NA) and cortisol (CORT) on bacteria that produce
volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), the major gases responsible for bad breath.
Cultures of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas endodontalis (Pe),
Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were exposed to 50
µM ADR, NA and CORT or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and
24 h. Growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. Portable gas
chromatography was used to measure VSC concentrations. Kruskal-Wallis and the
Dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. For Fn, ADR, NA and CORT
significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). All the
substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production (p<0.05). For Pe,
all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and 
NA significantly increased the H2S concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). In the Pg
and Pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). In the Pi
cultures, ADR, NA and CORT increased H2S (p<0.05). Catecholamines and cortisol
can interfere with growth and H2S production of sub-gingival species in vitro.
This process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress
and the production of VSC.
