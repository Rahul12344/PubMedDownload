The catalytic activity of Zap70 is crucial for T cell antigen receptor (TCR)
signaling, but the quantitative and temporal requirements for its function in
thymocyte development are not known. Using a chemical-genetic system to
selectively and reversibly inhibit Zap70 catalytic activity in a model of
synchronized thymic selection, we showed that CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes integrate
multiple, transient, Zap70-dependent signals over more than 36 h to reach a
cumulative threshold for positive selection, whereas 1 h of signaling was
sufficient for negative selection. Titration of Zap70 activity resulted in graded
reductions in positive and negative selection but did not decrease the cumulative
TCR signals integrated by positively selected OT-I cells, which revealed
heterogeneity, even among CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes expressing identical TCRs
undergoing positive selection.
