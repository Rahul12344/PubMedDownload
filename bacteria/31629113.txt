Type 1 reactions (T1R) an inflammatory condition, of local skin patches in 30-40%
leprosy patients during the course of MDT. IL-17A and IL-17F play an important
role in regulating skin inflammation through neutrophils. In the present study,
we have analyzed 18 of each T1R and Non-reactions (NR) patients through flow
cytometry and qPCR. Interestingly we found that, CD3+CD4+ gated IL-17A+IL-17F+
cells were significantly high in T1R in both MLSA stimulated PBMCs and skin
lesions as compared to NR leprosy patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis of
gene expression showed that CXCL6, CXCL5, CCL20, CCL7, MMP13 and IL-17RB
expression were significantly associated with IL-17A and IL-17F expression
(Spearman r2 = 0.77 to 0.98), neutrophils and monocyte markers respectively. In
this study, the inflammation noted in lesions of T1R is a different phenotype of 
Th17 which produce double positive IL-17A+IL17F+ and also contributes IL-17
producing neutrophils and thus would be useful for monitoring, diagnosis and
treatment response before reactions episodes.
