typhimurium tests].

One-hundred and six chemical compounds were tested in Ames test with bacteria
Salmonella typhimurium. Eight different strains (mainly, TA98 and TA100) were
used. Liver S9 from Aroclor-treated rats was employed for metabolic activation.
In group I comprising 51 compounds with sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity
for animals, 45 were mutagenic while 6 (urethane, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, DDT,
chlorophorm, 1,4-dioxane and carbon tetrachloride) were not. In group 2 (27
noncarcinogenic compounds), 22 agents failed to exhibit mutagenicity whereas 5
(acrolein, styrene-oxide, acridine orange, I-naphthylamine and dichlormethane)
revealed such activity. In groups 1 and 2, the sensitivity was 88.2,
specificity--81.5 and predictive value--90%. In group 3 consisting of 28 agents
used in chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries but not yet tested for
mutagenicity and for the carcinogenicity of which no conclusive data are
available, seven appeared to be mutagens (1-aminoanthraquinone,
2-aminoanthraquinone, 1-amino-4-chloranthraquinone, based blue,
dinitrochlorbenzene, nitrosodiphenylamine and 2,3,5-trinitronaphthalene).
