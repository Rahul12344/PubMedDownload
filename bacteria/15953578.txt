PURPOSE: To describe the unique clinical features of phlyctenular keratitis,
including the association with meibomitis, in young patients.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 23 Japanese patients aged under 35
years with phlyctenular keratitis. We examined their clinical history, signs and 
symptoms, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), bacterial cultures of meibum, and the
efficacy of antibiotics. The minimal diagnostic criteria included corneal nodules
consisting of cellular infiltrates and superficial neovascularization.
RESULTS: Of the 23 patients, 20 (87%) were women, and 13 (56.5%) had a history of
chalazia. In all cases, the lesions and the severity of corneal nodules and
neovascularization corresponded well with the location and the severity of
meibomitis. The frequency of HLA-A26 and HLA-B35 was significantly increased in
our patients (P = .003 and .016, respectively). Propionibacterium acnes in
bacterial cultures of pure meibum in 12 of the 20 patients (60%) was
statistically more highly positive than those in four of the 17 age-matched
normal control subjects (23.5%; P = .028).
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of phlyctenular keratitis in our cases include
significantly higher prevalence in female patients, severity variation of ocular 
surface manifestation corresponding to meibomitis, specific HLA association, and 
possible P. acnes involvement.
