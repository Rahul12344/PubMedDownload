Acute endocarditides, defined by the intensity of the infectious syndrome,
increase rapidly in incidence, both in absolute number and in relation with
classical subacute endocarditides. 60 cases were studied out of a lot of 130
cases of bacterial endocarditides. They are characterized by the nature of the
portals of entry, particularly in hospital, the nature of the causal germs
(staphylococci and gram-negative germs essentially), their habitually primary
character, the importance of embolic manifestations. Cardiac failure through
valvular mutilation is common, but surgical valve replacement is not always
possible in view of the visceral or infectious context. Their overall prognosis
is a very bad one: lethality 67 percent as against 15 percent for subacute
endocarditides. An important part of prevention lies in a better hospital
hygiene.
