G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) play an important role in
phosphorylating and regulating the activity of a variety of G protein-coupled
receptors. Chromosomal mapping of the human genes for the two most recently
identified members of the GRK family, GRK5 (GPRK5) and GRK6 (GPRK6), was
accomplished by correlation of the presence of the GPRK5 and GPRK6 loci with
specific chromosome regions in a rodent-human hybrid panel. These analyses
revealed that GPRK5 maps to chromosome region 10q24-->qter while GPRK6 maps to
5q35. A GPRK6 related locus maps to 13pter-->q21.
