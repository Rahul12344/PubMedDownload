Three condensed aromatic peptides SCH79235 (1), SCH79236 (2), and SCH204698 (3)
were isolated from the fermentation broth of a Streptomycete microorganism. The
structure of SCH204698 (3) was established by extensive NMR spectral data. All
these compounds exhibited good activity against CD28-CD80 binding with an IC(50) 
of 0.42, 0.38 and 0.22 microM, respectively.
