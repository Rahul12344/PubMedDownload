One of the most central questions about the repair of a double-strand DNA break
(DSB) concerns how the two free DNA ends are brought together - a step called
synapsis. Using single-molecule FRET (smFRET), we show here that both Ku plus
XRCC4:DNA ligase IV are necessary and sufficient to achieve a flexible synapsis
of blunt DNA ends, whereas either alone is not. Addition of XLF causes a
transition to a close synaptic state, and maximum efficiency of close synapsis is
achieved within 20â€‰min. The promotion of close synapsis by XLF indicates a role
that is independent of a filament structure, with action focused at the very ends
of each duplex. DNA-PKcs is not required for the formation of either the flexible
or close synaptic states. This model explains in biochemical terms the
evolutionarily central synaptic role of Ku, X4L4, and XLF in NHEJ for all
eukaryotes.
