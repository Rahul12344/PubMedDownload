T cell receptors (TCRs) orchestrate cellular immunity by recognizing peptides
presented by a range of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins.
Naturally occurring TCRs bind the composite peptide/MHC surface, recognizing
peptides that are structurally and chemically compatible with the TCR binding
site. Here we describe a molecularly evolved TCR variant that binds the human
class I MHC protein HLA-A2 independent of the bound peptide, achieved by a
drastic perturbation of the TCR binding geometry that places the molecule far
from the peptide binding groove. This unique geometry is unsupportive of normal T
cell signaling. A substantial divergence between affinity measurements in
solution and in two dimensions between proximal cell membranes leads us to
attribute the lack of signaling to steric hindrance that limits binding in the
confines of a cell-cell interface. Our results provide an example of how receptor
binding geometry can impact T cell function and provide further support for the
view that germline-encoded residues in TCR binding loops evolved to drive
productive TCR recognition and signaling.
