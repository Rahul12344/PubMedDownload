Coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A) is an evolutionarily conserved
protein, originally identified as a nuclear factor-κB activator through a
large-scale screen of human genes. Mutations in the human Cc2d1a gene result in
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability. It remains unclear,
however, how Cc2d1a mutation leads to alterations in brain function. Here, we
have taken advantage of Cre/loxP recombinase-based strategy to conditionally
delete Cc2d1a exclusively from excitatory neurons of male mouse forebrain to
examine its role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. We
confirmed the expression of CC2D1A protein and mRNA in the mouse hippocampus.
Double immunofluorescence staining showed that CC2D1A is expressed in both
excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the adult hippocampus. Conditional deletion 
of Cc2d1a (cKO) from excitatory neurons leads to impaired performance in object
location memory test and altered anxiety-like behavior. Consistently, cKO mice
displayed a deficit in the maintenance of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal
slices. Cc2d1a deletion also resulted in decreased complexity of apical and basal
dendritic arbors of CA1 pyramidal neurons. An enhanced basal Rac1 activity was
observed following Cc2d1a deletion, and this enhancement was mediated by reduced 
SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and SENP3 expression, thus increasing the amount
of Rac1 SUMOylation. Furthermore, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescued
impairments in LTP and object location memory performance in cKO mice. Together, 
our results implicate Rac1 hyperactivity in synaptic plasticity and cognitive
deficits observed in Cc2d1a cKO mice and reveal a novel role for CC2D1A in
regulating hippocampal synaptic function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT CC2D1A is
abundantly expressed in the brain, but there is little known about its
physiological function. Taking advantage of Cc2d1a cKO mice, the present study
highlights the importance of CC2D1A in the maintenance of LTP at Schaffer
collateral-CA1 synapses and the formation of hippocampus-dependent long-term
object location memory. Our findings establish a critical link between elevated
Rac1 activity, structural and synaptic plasticity alterations, and cognitive
impairment caused by Cc2d1a deletion. Moreover, partial blockade of Rac1 activity
rescues synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in Cc2d1a cKO mice. Such insights
may have implications for the utility of Rac1 inhibitors in the treatment of
intellectual disability caused by Cc2d1a mutations in human patients.
