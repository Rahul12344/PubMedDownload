In chronic nonhealing wounds, the healing process is disrupted and wounds are
often infected with bacteria. About 85% of lower extremity amputations in
diabetes are attributed to deep infection of foot ulcers. Therefore, infection
control is critical for wound care. In this study, we analyzed lipid composition 
of Chamaecyparis obtusa extract, and we describe the wound-healing properties of 
its combination of 10 major lipid components. A 10-lipid mixture up-regulated
HBD-3 and LL-37 through the olfactory receptor 2AT4 and induced phosphorylation
of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinases in primary human keratinocytes. In addition, the 10-lipid mixture had
direct bactericidal effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
pyogenes and protected against staphylococcal α-toxin-induced keratinocyte cell
death. In an animal model, the 10-lipid mixture accelerated skin wound healing
and was also effective in healing wounds superinfected with S. aureus. We suggest
that the 10-lipid mixture, because of its wound-healing and antimicrobial
properties, can be beneficial for wound treatment.
