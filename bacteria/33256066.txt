Skeletal muscles are high-insulin tissues responsible for disposing of glucose
via the highly regulated process of facilitated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4).
Impaired insulin action in diabetes, as well as disorders of GLUT4 vesicle
trafficking in the muscle, are involved in defects in insulin-stimulated GLUT4
translocation. Since the Rab GTPases are the main regulators of vesicular
membrane transport in exo- and endo-cytosis, in the present work, we studied the 
effect of olive leaf polyphenols (OLPs) on Rab8A, Rab13, and Rab14 proteins of
the rat soleus muscle in a model of streptozotocin (SZT)-induced diabetes (DM) in
a dose-dependent manner. Glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were
determined in the blood, morphological changes of the muscle tissue were captured
by hematoxylin and eosin histological staining, and expression of GLUT4, Rab8A,
Rab13, and Rab14 proteins were analyzed in the rat soleus muscle by the
immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting. OLPs significantly reduced blood 
glucose level in all treated groups. Furthermore, significantly reduced blood
triglycerides were found in the groups with the lowest and highest OLPs
treatment. The dynamics of activation of Rab8A, Rab13, and Rab14 was OLPs
dose-dependent and more effective at higher OLP doses. Thus, these results
indicate a beneficial role of phenolic compounds from the olive leaf in the
regulation of glucose homeostasis in the skeletal muscle.
