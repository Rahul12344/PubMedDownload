The production of an immersion vaccine and the vaccination procedure to immunize 
fry of perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) against pathogenic Aeromonas sobria that
harbor a type III secretion system is described. The vaccine, based on chemically
inactivated A. sobria, enables rapid vaccination of a large number of fish by
immersion of fry in an aqueous vaccine suspension during 5 min, giving them high 
protection during fattening under open water conditions in a freshwater lake for 
at least 4 months.
