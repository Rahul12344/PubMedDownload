Photolyase DNA interactions and the annealing of restriction fragment ends are
directly visualized with the atomic force microscope (AFM). To be able to
interact with proteins, DNA must be loosely bound to the surface. When MgCl2 is
used to immobilize DNA to mica, DNA is attached to the surface at distinct sites.
The pieces of DNA in between are free to move over the surface and are available 
for protein interaction. After implementation of a number of instrumental
improvements, the molecules can be visualized routinely, under physiological
conditions and with molecular resolution. Images are acquired reproducibly
without visible damage for at least 30 min, at a scan rate of 2 x 2 microm2/min
and a root mean square noise of less than 0.2 nm. Nonspecific photolyase DNA
complexes were visualized, showing association, dissociation, and movement of
photolyase over the DNA. The latter result suggests a sliding mechanism by which 
photolyase can scan DNA for damaged sites. The experiments illustrate the
potential that AFM presents for modern molecular biology.
