BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection induces nitric acid (NO)
overproduction through inducible NO synthase (NOS) expression, subsequent DNA
damage and enhanced antiapoptosis signal transduction sequence in the human
gastric mucosa, whereas its possible effect on endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
(eNOS) expression has not as yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of H. pylori infection in the expression of eNOS in gastric
mucosa.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 30 nonsmoking dyspeptic patients
(12 men, 18 women, mean age 54.26+/-12.89 years). The diagnosis of H. pylori
infection was based mainly on histology. The histological grading of H. pylori
infection was evaluated according to the modified Sydney classification.
Histological grading of eNOS expression and microvessel density as estimated by
CD34 expression were determined by immunohistochemistry (degree 0-3) and
correlated with H. pylori infection and histological degree of gastritis.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were H. pylori-positive and 18 patients were H.
pylori-negative. The two groups were matched for age (P=0.139), sex (P=0.342) and
similar degree of gastritis. Intensity of eNOS and CD34 expression in the corpus 
and antrum were significantly correlated (P<0.001). eNOS expression was
correlated with H. pylori infection in the mucosa of the body and antrum (P=0.013
and 0.037, respectively) but not with gastric inflammation and activity (P=0.848 
and 0.871, respectively, for the corpus and P=0.565 and 0.793, respectively, for 
the antrum). H. pylori-positive patients showed higher expression of
CD34-positive blood vessels in the mucosa of the antrum (P=0.048). CD34
expression was correlated with gastric inflammation and activity (P=0.03 and
0.044, respectively) in the mucosa of the antrum of H. pylori-positive patients.
CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection upregulates eNOS, and induces angiogenesis,
contributing to H. pylori-associated pathophysiology in gastric mucosa.
