IMPORTANCE: Limited data exist on clinical characteristics and outcomes of
patients who had infective endocarditis after undergoing transcatheter aortic
valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the associated factors, clinical characteristics, and
outcomes of patients who had infective endocarditis after TAVR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Infectious Endocarditis after TAVR
International Registry included patients with definite infective endocarditis
after TAVR from 47 centers from Europe, North America, and South America between 
June 2005 and October 2015.
EXPOSURE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement for incidence of infective
endocarditis and infective endocarditis for in-hospital mortality.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Infective endocarditis and in-hospital mortality
after infective endocarditis.
RESULTS: A total of 250 cases of infective endocarditis occurred in 20 006
patients after TAVR (incidence, 1.1% per person-year; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%; median
age, 80 years; 64% men). Median time from TAVR to infective endocarditis was 5.3 
months (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-13.4 months). The characteristics
associated with higher risk of progressing to infective endocarditis after TAVR
was younger age (78.9 years vs 81.8 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 per year; 95% 
CI, 0.94-0.99), male sex (62.0% vs 49.7%; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13-2.52), diabetes 
mellitus (41.7% vs 30.0%; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.29), and moderate to severe
aortic regurgitation (22.4% vs 14.7%; HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.28-3.28). Health
care-associated infective endocarditis was present in 52.8% (95% CI, 46.6%-59.0%)
of patients. Enterococci species and Staphylococcus aureus were the most
frequently isolated microorganisms (24.6%; 95% CI, 19.1%-30.1% and 23.3%; 95% CI,
17.9%-28.7%, respectively). The in-hospital mortality rate was 36% (95% CI,
30.0%-41.9%; 90 deaths; 160 survivors), and surgery was performed in 14.8% (95%
CI, 10.4%-19.2%) of patients during the infective endocarditis episode.
In-hospital mortality was associated with a higher logistic EuroSCORE (23.1% vs
18.6%; odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per 1% increase; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05), heart failure
(59.3% vs 23.7%; OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.74-6.45), and acute kidney injury (67.4% vs 
31.6%; OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.42-5.11). The 2-year mortality rate was 66.7% (95% CI,
59.0%-74.2%; 132 deaths; 115 survivors).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients undergoing TAVR, younger age, male sex,
history of diabetes mellitus, and moderate to severe residual aortic
regurgitation were significantly associated with an increased risk of infective
endocarditis. Patients who developed endocarditis had high rates of in-hospital
mortality and 2-year mortality.
