In this work we have investigated the ability of the biphenyl dioxygenase of
Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (BphAE(LB400)) and of Pandoraea pnomenusa B356
(BphAE(B356)) to metabolize DDT. Data show BphAE(LB400) is unable to metabolize
this substrate but BphAE(B356) metabolizes DDT to produce two stereoisomers.
Structural analysis of DDT-docked BphAE(LB400) and BphAE(B356) identified residue
Phe336 of BphAE(LB400) as critical to prevent productive binding of DDT to
BphAE(LB400). Furthermore, the fact that residue Gly319 of BphAE(B356) is less
constrained than Gly321 of BphAE(LB400) most likely contributes to the ability of
BphAE(B356) to bind DDT productively. This was confirmed by examining the ability
of BphAE chimeras obtained by shuffling bphA genes from strain B356 and LB400.
Chimeras where residues Thr335 (which modulates the constraints on Gly321) and
Phe336 (which contacts the substrate) of BphAE(LB400) were replaced by Gly and
Ile respectively were able to metabolize DDT. However their stereospecificities
varied depending on the presence of other segments or residues from BphAE(B356). 
Structural analysis suggests that either one or both of residue 267 and a
segments comprised of residue 247-260 are likely involved in stereospecificity.
