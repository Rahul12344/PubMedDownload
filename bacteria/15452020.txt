LPS-binding protein (LBP) can facilitate the transfer of cell wall components of 
both Gram-negative bacteria (LPS) and Gram-positive bacteria (lipoteichoic acid) 
to inflammatory cells. Although LBP is predominantly produced in the liver,
recent studies have indicated that this protein is also synthesized locally in
the lung by epithelial cells. To determine the role of LBP in the immune response
to pneumonia, LBP gene-deficient (-/-) and normal wild-type (WT) mice were
intra-nasally infected with either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella
pneumoniae, common Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, respectively.
Pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with a 7-fold rise in LBP concentrations in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of WT mice; LBP-/- mice infected with S. pneumoniae 
showed a similar survival and a similar bacterial burden in their lungs 48 h
post-infection. In Klebsiella pneumonia, however, LBP-/- mice demonstrated a
diminished survival together with an enhanced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs.
These data suggest that LBP is important for a protective immune response in
Klebsiella pneumonia, but does not contribute to an effective host response in
pneumococcal pneumonia.
