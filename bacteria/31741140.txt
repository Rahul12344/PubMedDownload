BACKGROUND: Diarrhea, a major pathological hallmark of inflammatory bowel
disease, is characterized by a significant reduction in the expression and
function of key intestinal ion transporters. The adoptive naïve CD4+ T cell
transfer colitis is an immune-based, chronic colitis mouse model which resembles 
human Crohn's disease. Although mice with T cell transfer colitis demonstrate
diarrhea, the ion transporter basis of this phenotype has not been explored.
AIMS/METHODS: In the current studies, we aimed to determine the mRNA and protein 
levels of the key NaCl transporters DRA and NHE3 along with the mRNA expression
of other transporters in the inflamed intestine.
RESULTS: Naïve CD4+ T cells, transferred to Rag2 knockout mice, induced severe
colonic inflammation characterized by histological damage and increased mRNA
levels of cytokines in the colon with no effect in the ileum. Diarrheal phenotype
was a key feature of the excised colons of mice where loose stools were evident. 
Our results demonstrated that the key chloride transporter DRA, mRNA, and protein
levels were significantly reduced in the inflamed colon. However, expression of
the key sodium hydrogen exchanger NHE3 was unaffected. The mRNA expression of
other important transporters was also determined; in this regard, the sodium
channel ENACα and the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and SMCT1 mRNA levels
were also significantly lower compared to control mice. However, CFTR mRNA was
not altered in the colon or ileum.
CONCLUSIONS: The studies conducted herein for the first time demonstrate the
downregulation of important intestinal ion transporters in proximal and distal
colon in T cell transfer colitis mouse model, providing valuable evidence for the
ion transporter basis of diarrhea in this chronic model of inflammation.
