PURPOSE: To associate the global gene expression of B7/CD28 family transcripts
with pathologic features of colon cancer, we determined the B7/CD28 family
transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal subjects
and patients with adenomatous polyps and colon cancer, and correlated the results
with pathologic features of colon cancer.
METHODS: PBMCs from age-matched normal subjects and patients with adenomatous
polyps and colon cancer were analyzed for peripheral blood transcripts (PBTs) of 
B7/CD28 family using real-time PCR. Differences in expression levels of B7/CD28
PBTs across all cancer stages and between colon cancer patients with or without
microscopic lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were analyzed.
RESULTS: The results showed a significant upregulation of PBTs of co-inhibitory
molecules such as B7-H3 and PD-1 and a significant PBT downregulation of
co-stimulatory molecules including CD28 and ICOS in colon cancer patients.
Furthermore, the increase of B7-H3 PBT was strongly associated with tumor
invasion (P = 0.025) and advanced TNM stages (P = 0.019), whereas the decline of 
co-stimulatory ligand B7-H2 PBT was related to regional lymph node metastasis (P 
= 0.028) and aggressive tumor invasion (P = 0.031). In addition, the ratios of
PBT expression of CD28 family to B7 family such as CTLA-4 to B7-H2 and PD-1 to
B7-H2 were significantly higher in colon cancer patients with microscopic LVI
than in those without LVI (P = 0.001 and P = 0.016, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that B7/CD28 family PBTs may serve as valuable
markers reflecting the pathological features of colon cancer.
