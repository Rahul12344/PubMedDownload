PURPOSE: Heritable genetic variations can affect the inflammatory tumor
microenvironment, which can ultimately affect cancer susceptibility and clinical 
outcomes. Recent evidence indicates that IDO2, a positive modifier in
inflammatory disease models, is frequently upregulated in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A unique feature of IDO2 in humans is the high prevalence 
of two inactivating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), which affords the
opportunity to carry out loss-of-function studies directly in humans. In this
study, we sought to address whether genetic loss of IDO2 may influence PDAC
development and responsiveness to treatment.Experimental Design: Transgenic Ido2 
+/+ and Ido2 -/- mice in which oncogenic KRAS is activated in pancreatic
epithelial cells were evaluated for PDAC. Two patient data sets (N = 200) were
evaluated for the two IDO2-inactivating SNPs together with histologic, RNA
expression, and clinical survival data.
RESULTS: PDAC development was notably decreased in the Ido2 -/- mice (30% vs.
10%, P < 0.05), with a female predominance similar to the association observed
for one of the human SNPs. In patients, the biallelic occurrence of either of the
two IDO2-inactivating SNPs was significantly associated with markedly improved
disease-free survival in response to adjuvant radiotherapy (P < 0.01), a
treatment modality that has been highly debated due to its variable efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide genetic support for IDO2 as a
contributing factor in PDAC development and argue that IDO2 genotype analysis has
the immediate potential to influence the PDAC care decision-making process
through stratification of those patients who stand to benefit from adjuvant
radiotherapy.
