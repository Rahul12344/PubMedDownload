Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are an emerging cancer therapy; however,
their effect on natural killer (NK) cell-mediated anti-tumor responses remain
unknown. Here, we evaluated the impact of a benzamide HDACi, entinostat, on human
primary NK cells as well as tumor cell lines. Entinostat significantly
upregulated the expression of NKG2D, an essential NK cell activating receptor.
Independently, entinostat augmented the expression of ULBP1, HLA, and MICA/B on
both rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Additionally, entinostat
increased both cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in human NK cells following
coculture with these tumor cells. Mechanistically, entinostat treatment resulted 
in increased chromatin accessibility to the promoter region for
interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) gene and
thereby increasing the transcript and protein levels of IFIT1 that augmented the 
IFIT1-mediated IRF1, STAT4, and STING pathways. Corresponding transcriptome
analysis revealed enrichment of IRF1 and STAT4 and gene sets responsible for NK
cell-mediated IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity, respectively. Our results show a
novel mechanism by which entinostat initiates an IFIT1-STING-mediated
potentiation of STAT4 via IRF1 to augment NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses.
