This chapter discusses atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the benefit of
microbiologists who are interested in using this technique to examine the
structures and dynamics of bacteria. AFM is a powerful technique for imaging
biological samples at the nanometer to micrometer scale under nondestructive
conditions. In order to be imaged with AFM, bacteria must be supported by a
surface, which presents challenges because many laboratory strains of bacteria
are planktonic. Still, in nature many bacteria live at surfaces and interfaces.
This chapter discusses the benefits and difficulties of different methods that
have been used to support bacteria on surfaces for AFM imaging and presents two
methods in detail used to successfully grow and image bacteria at solid-liquid
and solid-air interfaces. Using these methods it is possible to study bacterial
morphology and interactions in a native state. These explorations by AFM have
important applications to the study of different kinds of bacteria, interfacial
bacterial communities, and biofilms.
