Th17 cells are a new lineage of T-cells that are controlled by the transcription 
factor RORgammat and develop independent of GATA-3, T-bet, Stat 4 and Stat 6.
Novel effector molecules produced by these cells include IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22,
and IL-26. IL-17RA binds IL-17A and IL-17F and is critical for host defense
against extracellular planktonic bacteria by regulating chemokine gradients for
neutrophil emigration into infected tissue sites as well as host granulopoiesis. 
Moreover, IL-17 and IL-22 regulate the production of antimicrobial proteins in
mucosal epithelium. Although TGF-beta1 and IL-6 have been shown to be critical
for development of Th17 cells from naive precursors, IL-23 is also important in
regulating IL-17 release in mucosal tissues in response to infectious stimuli.
Compared to Th1 cells, IL-23 and IL-17 show limited roles in controlling host
defense against primary infections with intracellular bacteria such as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis suggesting a predominate role of the Th17 lineage in
host defense against extracellular pathogens. However, in the setting of chronic 
biofilm infections, as that occurs with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis, Th17
cells may be key contributors of tissue injury.
