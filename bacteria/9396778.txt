Itk is a member of the Btk/Tec/Itk family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases
(PTKs), and has been implicated in T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signal
transduction. Lck and Fyn are the Src-family nonreceptor PTKs that are involved
in TCR signaling. To address the question of how these members of different
families of PTKs functionally contribute to T cell development and to T cell
activation, mice deficient for both Itk and either Lck or Fyn were generated. The
Itk/Lck doubly deficient mice exhibited a phenotype similar to that of
Lck-deficient mice. The phenotype of the Itk/Fyn doubly deficient mice was
similar to that of Itk deficient mice. However the Itk/Fyn doubly deficient mice 
exhibited a more severe defect in TCR-induced proliferation of thymocytes and
peripheral T cells than did mice deficient in either kinase alone. These data
support the notion that Itk and Fyn both make independent contributions to
TCR-induced T cell activation.
