NKp44 is a receptor encoded by the NCR2 gene, which is expressed by
cytokine-activated natural killer (NK) cells that are involved in anti-AML
immunity. NKp44 has three splice variants corresponding to NKp44ITIM+ (NKp44-1)
and NKp44ITIM- (NKp44-2, and NKp44-3) isoforms. RNAseq data of AML patients
revealed similar survival of NKp46+NKp44+ and NKp46+NKp44- patients. However, if 
grouped according to the NKp44 splice variant profile, NKp44-1 expression was
significantly associated with poor survival of AML patients. Moreover, activation
of PBMC from healthy controls showed co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and
NKp44-3, while primary NK clones show more diverse NKp44 splice variant profiles.
Cultured primary NK cells resulted in NKp44-1 dominance and impaired function
associated with PCNA over-expression by target cells. This impaired functional
phenotype could be rescued by blocking of NKp44 receptor. Human NK cell lines
revealed co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 and showed a functional
phenotype that was not inhibited by PCNA over-expression. Furthermore,
transfection-based overexpression of NKp44-1, but not NKp44-2/NKp44-3, reversed
the endogenous resistance of NK-92 cells to PCNA-mediated inhibition, and
resulted in poor formation of stable lytic immune synapses. This research
contributes to the understanding of AML prognosis by shedding new light on the
functional implications of differential splicing of NKp44.
