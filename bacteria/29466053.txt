The 66 kDa isoform of the mammalian Shc gene promotes adipogenesis, and p66Shc-/-
mice accumulate less body weight than wild-type (WT) mice. As the metabolic
consequences of the leaner phenotype of p66Shc-/- mice is debated, we
hypothesized that gut microbiota may be involved. We confirmed that p66Shc-/-
mice gained less weight than WT mice when on a high-fat diet (HFD), but they were
not protected from insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. p66Shc deletion
significantly modified the composition of gut microbiota and their modification
after an HFD. This was associated with changes in gene expression of Il-1b and
regenerating islet-derived protein 3 Î³ ( Reg3g) in the gut and in systemic
trimethylamine N-oxide and branched chain amino acid levels, despite there being 
no difference in intestinal structure and permeability. Depleting gut microbiota 
at the end of HFD rendered both strains more glucose tolerant but improved
insulin sensitivity only in p66Shc-/- mice. Microbiota-depleted WT mice cohoused 
with microbiota-competent p66Shc-/- mice became significantly more insulin
resistant than WT mice cohoused with WT mice, despite no difference in weight
gain. These findings reconcile previous inconsistent observations on the
metabolic phenotype of p66Shc-/- mice and illustrate the complex
microbiome-host-genotype interplay under metabolic stress.-Ciciliot, S., Albiero,
