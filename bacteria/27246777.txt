The blaIMP-14 carbapenem resistance gene has largely previously been observed in 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. As part of global surveillance and 
sequencing of carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli, we identified a sequence
type 131 strain harboring blaIMP-14 within a class 1 integron, itself nested
within an ∼54-kb multidrug resistance region on an epidemic IncA/C2 plasmid. The 
emergence of blaIMP-14 in this context in the ST131 lineage is of potential
clinical concern.
