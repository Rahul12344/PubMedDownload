OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT)
prioritisation to mitigate the impact of delays in the colorectal cancer (CRC)
urgent diagnostic (2-week-wait (2WW)) pathway consequent from the COVID-19
pandemic.
DESIGN: We modelled the reduction in CRC survival and life years lost resultant
from per-patient delays of 2-6 months in the 2WW pathway. We stratified by age
group, individual-level benefit in CRC survival versus age-specific nosocomial
COVID-19-related fatality per referred patient undergoing colonoscopy. We
modelled mitigation strategies using thresholds of FIT triage of 2, 10 and 150 µg
Hb/g to prioritise 2WW referrals for colonoscopy. To construct the underlying
models, we employed 10-year net CRC survival for England 2008-2017, 2WW pathway
CRC case and referral volumes and per-day-delay HRs generated from observational 
studies of diagnosis-to-treatment interval.
RESULTS: Delay of 2/4/6 months across all 11 266 patients with CRC diagnosed per 
typical year via the 2WW pathway were estimated to result in 653/1419/2250
attributable deaths and loss of 9214/20 315/32 799 life years. Risk-benefit from 
urgent investigatory referral is particularly sensitive to nosocomial COVID-19
rates for patients aged >60. Prioritisation out of delay for the 18% of
symptomatic referrals with FIT >10 µg Hb/g would avoid 89% of these deaths
attributable to presentational/diagnostic delay while reducing immediate
requirement for colonoscopy by >80%.
CONCLUSIONS: Delays in the pathway to CRC diagnosis and treatment have potential 
to cause significant mortality and loss of life years. FIT triage of symptomatic 
patients in primary care could streamline access to colonoscopy, reduce delays
for true-positive CRC cases and reduce nosocomial COVID-19 mortality in older
true-negative 2WW referrals. However, this strategy offers benefit only in
short-term rationalisation of limited endoscopy services: the appreciable
false-negative rate of FIT in symptomatic patients means most colonoscopies will 
still be required.
