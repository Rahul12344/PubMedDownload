The total synthesis of the mycobacterial toxins mycolactones A/B (1 a/b) has been
accomplished based on a strategy built around the construction of the mycolactone
core through ring-closing metathesis. By employing the Grubbs second-generation
catalyst, the 12-membered core macrocycle of mycolactones, with a functionalized 
C2 handle attached to C11, was obtained in 60-80 % yield. The C-linked upper side
chain (comprising C12-C20) was completed by a highly efficient modified Suzuki
coupling between C13 and C14, while the attachment of the C5-O-linked
polyunsaturated acyl side chain was achieved by Yamaguchi esterification.
Surprisingly, a diene containing a simple isopropyl group attached to C11 could
not be induced to undergo ring-closing metathesis. By employing fluorescence
microscopy and flow cytometry techniques, the synthetic mycolactones A/B (1 a/b) 
were demonstrated to display similar apoptosis-inducing and cytopathic effects as
mycolactones A/B extracted from Mycobacterium ulcerans. In contrast, a simplified
analogue with truncated upper and lower side chains was found to be inactive.
