The humanized bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) mouse model harbors a nearly
complete human immune system, therefore providing a powerful tool to study human 
immunology and immunotherapy. However, its application is greatly limited by the 
restricted supply of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and fetal thymus
tissues that are needed to generate these mice. The restriction is especially
significant for the study of human immune systems with special genetic traits,
such as certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes or monogene
deficiencies. To circumvent this critical limitation, we have developed a method 
to quickly propagate established BLT mice. Through secondary transfer of bone
marrow cells and human thymus implants from BLT mice into NSG
(NOD/SCID/IL-2RÎ³-/-) recipient mice, we were able to expand one primary BLT mouse
into a colony of 4-5 proBLT (propagated BLT) mice in 6-8 weeks. These proBLT mice
reconstituted human immune cells, including T cells, at levels comparable to
those of their primary BLT donor mouse. They also faithfully inherited the human 
immune cell genetic traits from their donor BLT mouse, such as the HLA-A2
haplotype that is of special interest for studying HLA-A2-restricted human T cell
immunotherapies. Moreover, an EGFP reporter gene engineered into the human immune
system was stably passed from BLT to proBLT mice, making proBLT mice suitable for
studying human immune cell gene therapy. This method provides an opportunity to
overcome a critical hurdle to utilizing the BLT humanized mouse model and enables
its more widespread use as a valuable preclinical research tool.
