Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are two major skin
associated bacteria, and Substance P (SP) is a major skin neuropeptide. Since
bacteria are known to sense and response to many human hormones, we investigated 
the effects of SP on Staphylococci virulence in reconstructed human epidermis
model and HaCaT keratinocytes. We show that SP is stimulating the virulence of S.
aureus and S. epidermidis in a reconstructed human epidermis model. qRT-PCR array
analysis of 64 genes expressed by keratinocytes in the response to bacterial
infection revealed a potential link between the action of SP on Staphylococci and
skin physiopathology. qRT-PCR and direct assay of cathelicidin and human
β-defensin 2 secretion also provided that demonstration that the action of SP on 
bacteria is independent of antimicrobial peptide expression by keratinocytes.
Considering an effect of SP on S. aureus and S. epidermidis, we observed that SP 
increases the adhesion potential of both bacteria on keratinocytes. However, SP
modulates the virulence of S. aureus and S. epidermidis through different
mechanisms. The response of S. aureus is associated with an increase in
Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) production and a reduction of exolipase
processing whereas in S. epidermidis the effect of SP appears mediated by a rise 
in biofilm formation activity. The Thermo unstable ribosomal Elongation factor
Ef-Tu was identified as the SP-interacting protein in S. aureus and S.
epidermidis. SP appears as an inter-kingdom communication factor involved in the 
regulation of bacterial virulence and essential for skin microflora homeostasis.
