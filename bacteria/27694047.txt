Abiotic and biotic processes can be used to remediate DDX (DDT, DDD, DDE, and
DDNS) contaminated soils; these processes can be fostered using specific
carbon-amendments to stimulate particular soil indigenous microbial communities
to improve rates or extent of degradation. In this study, toluene and glycerol
were evaluated as cosubstrates under aerobic and anoxic conditions to determine
the degradation efficiencies of DDX and to elucidate possible degradation
mechanisms. Slurry microcosms experiments were performed during 60 days using
pretreated soil with zero-valent iron (ZVI). Toluene addition enhanced the
percentage of degradation of DDX. DDNS was the main compound degraded (around
86%) under aerobic conditions, suggesting cometabolic degradation of DDX by
toluene-degrading soil bacteria. Glycerol addition under anoxic conditions
favored the abiotic degradation of DDX mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria
activity, where DDT was the main compound degraded (around 90%). The 16S rDNA
metagenomic analyses revealed Rhodococcus ruber and Desulfosporosinus
auripigmenti as the predominant bacterial species after 40 days of treatment with
toluene and glycerol additions, respectively. This study provides evidence of
biotic and abiotic DDX degradation by the addition of toluene and glycerol as
cosubstrates in ZVI pretreated DDX-contaminated soil.
