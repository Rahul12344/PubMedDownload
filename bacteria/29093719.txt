Interaction of the human monocytic cell line, THP-1 with clinical isolates of
three Curvularia species were examined. Members of this filamentous fungal genus 
can cause deep mycoses emerging in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent
patients. It was found that monocytes reacted only to the hyphal form of
Curvularia lunata. Cells attached to the germ tubes and hyphae and production of 
elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 and a low level of TNF-α were
measured. At the same time, monocytes failed to produce IL-6. This monocytic
response, especially with the induction of the anti-inflammatory IL-10,
correlates well to the observation that C. lunata frequently cause chronic
infections even in immunocompetent persons. Despite the attachment to the hyphae,
monocytes could not reduce the viability of the fungus and the significant
decrease in the relative transcript level of HLA-DRA assumes the lack of antigen 
presentation of the fungus by this cell type. C. spicifera and C. hawaiiensis
failed to induce the gathering of the cells or the production of any analyzed
cytokines. Monocytes did not recognize conidia of Curvularia species, even when
melanin was lacking in their cell wall.
