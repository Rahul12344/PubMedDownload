Human gingival fibroblasts (hGF) reside in gingival tissues which are challenged 
frequently by oral bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal pathogens 
can penetrate gingival tissues and stimulate plasminogen activator (PA) activity 
which is implicated in the PA/plasmin proteolytic system. The PA/plasmin system
plays an important role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and
synthesis of kinin in the process of inflammation. Anti-inflammatory effects by
low-energy laser irradiation have been reported. However, the mechanisms of
biostimulatory effects have not been elucidated in detail. The primarily cultured
hGF cells were challenged with LPS isolated from Campylobacter rectus which was
known as a periodontal pathogen and Ga-Al-As diode low energy laser was
irradiated (830 nm, 7.90 J/cm(2)). The cultured medium of hGF cells showed a
marked elevation in PA activity by LPS, which was significantly inhibited by the 
laser irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was involved in the
reduction of tPA mRNA levels.
