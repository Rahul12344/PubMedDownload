This meta-analysis examined the relationship between IL-17A (rs2275913) and IL17F
(rs763780 T/C) gene polymorphisms and the risk of inflammatory diseases,
including periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel
disease. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Elsevier Science Direct
were searched, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were
calculated to estimate the strength of the association. A total of 25 studies
comprising 7,474 cases and 10,628 controls were included. Significant
associations were found between inflammatory diseases and IL-17A rs2275913 A
versus G allele (OR = 1.197, P = 0.033) and the GA versus GG genotype in the
codominant model (OR = 1.406, P = 0.036). Our findings suggested that individuals
who carry the rs2275913 A allele or GA genotype have a 20% or 41%-increased risk 
of inflammatory diseases compared with subjects with the G allele or GG genotype,
respectively. With respect to IL-17F rs763780, the C versus T allele (OR = 1.94; 
P = 0.040), the TC versus TT (OR = 1.39; P = 0.041), the CC versus TT (OR = 2.71;
P = 0.003), as well as the TC + CC versus TT genotype (OR = 1.83; P = 0.032) were
risk factors for RA. In summary, our pooled analysis indicated that the IL-17A
(rs2275913) and IL17F (rs763780 T/C) increased the RA risk.
