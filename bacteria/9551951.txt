Unless a costimulatory signal is provided, TCR recognition of Ag bound to the MHC
is insufficient to induce optimal T cell proliferation or the production of IL-2.
Here we show that the stimulation of CD28, a T cell costimulatory receptor, by a 
specific Ab increases F-actin contents in T cells. The interaction between T
cells and B7-2-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the CD28 ligand
leads to the rearrangement of the actin cytoskelton in the region of cell-cell
contact. Within the Rho family of G proteins, Rac1, but not Rho, translocates to 
the sites of cell-cell contact where Tailin also accumulates. These results
indicate that the interaction between B7-2 and CD28 establishes a focal
adhesion-like cell contact between T cell and APCs. The results also suggest that
CD28 signaling is primarily transduced by a cytoskeletal rearrangement/signaling 
pathway mediated by the Rho family G proteins.
