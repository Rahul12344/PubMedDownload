PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neutrophils are known to dominate the pulmonary inflammatory
process observed in cystic fibrosis (CF). An enduring paradox is how these large 
numbers of neutrophils fail to eradicate colonizing bacteria. Major advances in
our understanding of neutrophil dysfunction in CF and its effect on the innate
immune system are leading to advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology
and leading directly to new therapies.
RECENT FINDINGS: New mechanisms of neutrophil dysfunction have been described in 
CF including disabled cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
recruitment to phagosomes and novel mechanisms of protease-induced neutrophil
dysfunction. Neutrophil elastase has been shown to be present in the airway very 
early in life in CF patients, and appears a biomarker of disease progression,
predicting lung function decline and bronchiectasis. Elastase has also been shown
to induce a pro-inflammatory state of senescence in bronchial epithelial cells in
vitro and potentially in vivo. Inhibitors of neutrophil elastase are now entering
clinical trials with promising results. New avenues of CF therapeutics are being 
explored including novel macrolides, CXCR2 antagonists and exogenous opsonins.
SUMMARY: This article reviews the past 12 months of research that contributes to 
our understanding of the role of neutrophils and immune dysfunction in CF.
