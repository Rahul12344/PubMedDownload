BACKGROUND: Immune suppression in the tumour microenvironment remains a major
limitation to successful immunotherapy of cancer. In the current study, we
analysed whether the natural killer T cell-activating glycolipid
α-galactosylceramide could overcome immune suppression and improve vaccination
against metastatic breast cancer.
METHODS: Mice with metastatic breast cancer (4T1 model) were therapeutically
treated with a Listeria monocytogenes-based vaccine expressing tumour-associated 
antigen Mage-b followed by α-galactosylceramide as separate agents, or as a
complex of α-galactosylceramide stably incorporated into Listeria-Mage-b. Effects
on metastases, tumour weight, toxicity and immune responses were determined.
RESULTS: Sequential treatments of mice with established 4T1 breast carcinomas
using Listeria-Mage-b followed by α-galactosylceramide as a separate agent was
highly effective at reducing metastases, but was accompanied by severe liver
toxicity. In contrast, combined therapy using Listeria-Mage-b modified by
incorporation of α-galactosylceramide resulted in nearly complete elimination of 
metastases without toxicity. This was associated with a significant increase in
the percentage of natural killer T cells in the spleen, and an increase in
natural killer cell activity and in T cell responses to Mage-b.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that direct incorporation of
α-galactosylceramide into a live bacterial vaccine vector is a promising
non-toxic new approach for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
