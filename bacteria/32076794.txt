Dendritic cell (DC) based immunotherapy is a promising approach to clinical
cancer treatment. miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that bind 
to RNAs to mediate multiple events which are important in diverse biological
processes. miRNA mimics and antagomirs may be potent agents to enhance DC-based
immunotherapy against cancers. miRNA array analysis was used to identify a
representative miR-5119 potentially regulating PD-L1 in DCs. We evaluated levels 
of ligands of immune cell inhibitory receptors (IRs) and miR-5119 in DCs from
immunocompetent mouse breast tumor-bearing mice, and examined the molecular
targets of miR-5119. We report that miRNA-5119 was downregulated in spleen DCs
from mouse breast cancer-bearing mice. In silico analysis and qPCR data showed
that miRNA-5119 targeted mRNAs encoding multiple negative immune regulatory
molecules, including ligands of IRs such as PD-L1 and IDO2. DCs engineered to
express a miR-5119 mimic downregulated PD-L1 and prevented T cell exhaustion in
mice with breast cancer homografts. Moreover, miR-5119 mimic-engineered DCs
effectively restored function to exhausted CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo,
resulting in robust anti-tumor cell immune response, upregulated cytokine
production, reduced T cell apoptosis, and exhaustion. Treatment of 4T1 breast
tumor-bearing mice with miR-5119 mimic-engineered DC vaccine reduced T cell
exhaustion and suppressed mouse breast tumor homograft growth. This study
provides evidence supporting a novel therapeutic approach using miRNA-5119
mimic-engineered DC vaccines to regulate inhibitory receptors and enhance
anti-tumor immune response in a mouse model of breast cancer. miRNA/DC-based
immunotherapy has potential for advancement to the clinic as a new strategy for
DC-based anti-breast cancer immunotherapy.
