Relapse occurs in 10-40% of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) patients that have completed
intensive chemotherapy regimens and is typically fatal. While treatment-naive BL 
has been characterized, the genomic landscape of BL at the time of relapse (rBL) 
has never been reported. Here, we present a genomic characterization of two rBL
patients. The diagnostic samples had mutations common in BL, including MYC and
CCND3. Additional mutations were detected at relapse, affecting important
pathways such as NFκB (IKBKB) and MEK/ERK (NRAS) signaling, glutamine metabolism 
(SIRT4), and RNA processing (ZFP36L2). Genes implicated in drug resistance were
also mutated at relapse (TP53, BAX, ALDH3A1, APAF1, FANCI). This concurrent
genomic profiling of samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse has revealed
mutations not previously reported in this disease. The patient-derived cell lines
will be made available and, along with their detailed genetics, will be a
valuable resource to examine the role of specific mutations in therapeutic
resistance.
