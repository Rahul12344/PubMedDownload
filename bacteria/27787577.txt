An immunotherapeutic strategy is discussed supporting anti-tumor activity toward 
malignancies overexpressing ganglioside D3. GD3 can be targeted by NKT cells when
derived moieties are presented in the context of CD1d. NKT cells can support
anti-tumor responses by secreting inflammatory cytokines and through cytotoxicity
toward CD1d+GD3+ tumors. To overexpress GD3, we generated expression vector DNA
and an adenoviral vector encoding the enzyme responsible for generating GD3 from 
its ubiquitous precursor GM3. We show that DNA encoding α-N-acetyl-neuraminide
α-2,8-sialyltransferase 1 (SIAT8) introduced by gene gun vaccination in vivo
leads to overexpression of GD3 and delays tumor growth. Delayed tumor growth is
dependent on CD1d expression by host immune cells, as shown in experiments
engaging CD1d knockout mice. A trend toward greater NKT cell populations among
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with SIAT8 vaccination. A single
adenoviral vaccination introduces anti-tumor activity similarly to repeated
vaccination with naked DNA. Here, greater NKT tumor infiltrates were accompanied 
by marked overexpression of IL-17 in the tumor, later switching to IL-4. Our
results suggest that a single intramuscular adenoviral vaccination introduces
overexpression of GD3 by antigen-presenting cells at the injection site,
recruiting NKT cells that provide an inflammatory anti-tumor environment. We
propose adenoviral SIAT8 (AdV-SIAT8) can slow the growth of GD3 expressing tumors
in patients.
