In summer 2012, Arctic sea ice declined to a record minimum and, as a consequence
of the melting, large amounts of aggregated ice-algae sank to the seafloor at
more than 4,000 m depth. In this study, we assessed the composition, turnover and
connectivity of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities across Arctic
habitats from sea ice, algal aggregates and surface waters to the seafloor.
Eukaryotic communities were dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates and other
alveolates in all samples, and showed highest richness and diversity in sea-ice
habitats (∼400-500 OTUs). Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria were the
predominant bacterial classes across all investigated Arctic habitats. Bacterial 
community richness and diversity peaked in deep-sea samples (∼1,700 OTUs). Algal 
aggregate-associated bacterial communities were mainly recruited from the sea-ice
community, and were transported to the seafloor with the sinking ice algae. The
algal deposits at the seafloor had a unique community structure, with some shared
sequences with both the original sea-ice community (22% OTU overlap), as well as 
with the deep-sea sediment community (17% OTU overlap). We conclude that
ice-algal aggregate export does not only affect carbon export from the surface to
the seafloor, but may change microbial community composition in central Arctic
habitats with potential effects for benthic ecosystem functioning in the future.
