BCL-G, an apoptotic factor in Bcl-2 family, is involved in several kinds of
diseases by interacting with several proteins. Although many studies on mouse and
human BCL-G have been reported, porcine BCL-G (pBCL-G) has been little
investigated. In this study, our results showed that pBCL-G was universally
expressed in porcine tissues. The BH2 domain affected the subcellular
distribution of pBCL-G protein. pBCL-G could interact with porcine JAB1 (pJAB1), 
by which its subcellular distribution was affected. pBCL-G promoted
staurosporine-induced apoptosis that was significantly enhanced by interaction of
pBCL-G with pJAB1. The apoptosis at least partially depended on the activated
caspase-8, -9 and -3. Owing to the close phylogenetic distance between pigs and
humans and their many physiological similarities, our findings may provide a
potential molecular model to study human BCL-G and also may have implications in 
the treatment of diseases relevant with BCL-G.
