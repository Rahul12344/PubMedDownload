We examined the expression of CXCL8 (interleukin-8), its receptors, CXCR1 and
CXCR2, and vessel density in human melanoma by immunohistochemical analysis of
tumors from different Clark levels, depths, and thicknesses. Expression of CXCL8 
and CXCR2 was lower in Clark level I and II specimens than in level III through V
specimens and metastases. CXCR1 expression was observed ubiquitously in the
majority of human melanoma tumor specimens irrespective of disease state, with
the highest intensity in Clark level III specimens. We observed a significant
difference in CXCL8 and CXCR2 expression between thin (<or=0.75 mm) and thick
(>0.75 mm) melanomas and between thin and metastatic lesions. Positive
correlations were observed between Clark level and CXCL8 or CXCR2 and between
thickness and CXCR2 expression. We found no correlation between vessel density
and Clark level or thickness. Our data suggest that expression of CXCL8 and CXCR2
contributes to aggressive growth and metastasis in human malignant melanoma.
Consistent with the transition from radial to vertical growth phase melanoma,
expression of CXCL8 and its receptor, CXCR2, may be key in the switch to an
aggressive, more metastatic phenotype.
