The Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain is a protein interaction domain that directs
myriad phosphotyrosine (pY)-signaling pathways. Genome-wide screening of human
SH2 domains reveals that ∼90% of SH2 domains bind plasma membrane lipids and many
have high phosphoinositide specificity. They bind lipids using surface cationic
patches separate from pY-binding pockets, thus binding lipids and the pY motif
independently. The patches form grooves for specific lipid headgroup recognition 
or flat surfaces for non-specific membrane binding and both types of interaction 
are important for cellular function and regulation of SH2 domain-containing
proteins. Cellular studies with ZAP70 showed that multiple lipids bind its
C-terminal SH2 domain in a spatiotemporally specific manner and thereby exert
exquisite spatiotemporal control over its protein binding and signaling
activities in T cells. Collectively, this study reveals how lipids control SH2
domain-mediated cellular protein-protein interaction networks and suggest a new
strategy for therapeutic modulation of pY-signaling pathways.
