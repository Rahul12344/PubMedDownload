OBJECTIVES: In vitro models showing synergism between polymyxins and carbapenems 
support combination treatment for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN)
infections. We tested the association between the presence of in vitro synergism 
and clinical outcomes in patients treated with colistin plus meropenem.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of AIDA, a randomized controlled trial
comparing colistin with colistin-meropenem for severe CRGN infections. We tested 
in vitro synergism using a checkerboard assay. Based on the fractional inhibitory
concentration (ΣFIC) index for each colistin-meropenem combination, we
categorized results as synergistic, antagonistic or additive/indifferent. The
primary outcome was clinical failure at 14 days. Secondary outcomes were 14- and 
28-day mortality and microbiological failure.
RESULTS: The sample included 171 patients with infections caused by
carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 131), Enterobacteriaceae
(n = 37) and Pseudomonas aeuruginosa (n = 3). In vitro testing showed synergism
for 73 isolates, antagonism for 20 and additivism/indifference for 78. In
patients who received any colistin plus meropenem, clinical failure at 14 days
was 59/78 (75.6%) in the additivism/indifference group (reference category),
54/73 (74.0%) in the synergism group (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.76, 95% CI
0.31-1.83), and 11/20 (55%) in the antagonism group (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.22-2.73).
There was no significant difference between groups for any secondary outcome.
Comparing the synergism group to patients treated with colistin monotherapy,
synergism was not protective against 14-day clinical failure (aOR 0.52, 95% CI
0.26-1.04) or 14-day mortality (aOR1.09, 95% CI 0.60-1.96).
DISCUSSION: In vitro synergism between colistin and meropenem via checkerboard
method did not translate into clinical benefit.
