A case of a tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton schoenleinii is presented. It
involves a 6-year old Tunisian boy that had presented with diffuse scaling of the
scalp misdiagnosed as psoriasis and was treated unsuccessfully with keratolytic
shampoos for two years. Tinea favosa due to Trichophyton schoenleinii was
confirmed by mycological examination. He was successfully treated with
griseofulvin for 6 weeks and topical application of imidazole. Trichophyton
schoenleinii is an important anthropophilic dermatophyte that causes tinea
favosa. It is transmitted by contagion between humans and is currently endemic in
Africa. Ringworm is still frequent in Tunisia, but favus is becoming exceptional 
due to improvements in living conditions and hygiene.
