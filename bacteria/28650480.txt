The origin and specification of human dendritic cells (DCs) have not been
investigated at the clonal level. Through the use of clonal assays, combined with
statistical computation, to quantify the yield of granulocytes, monocytes,
lymphocytes and three subsets of DCs from single human CD34+ progenitor cells, we
found that specification to the DC lineage occurred in parallel with
specification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the myeloid and lymphoid
lineages. This started as a lineage bias defined by specific transcriptional
programs that correlated with the combinatorial 'dose' of the transcription
factors IRF8 and PU.1, which was transmitted to most progeny cells and was
reinforced by upregulation of IRF8 expression driven by the hematopoietic
cytokine FLT3L during cell division. We propose a model in which specification to
the DC lineage is driven by parallel and inheritable transcriptional programs in 
HSCs and is reinforced over cell division by recursive interactions between
transcriptional programs and extrinsic signals.
