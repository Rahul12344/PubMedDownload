BackgroundEscherichia coli ST131, a global, high-risk clone, comprises
fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) mutations and CTX-M extended-spectrum
beta-lactamases associated with the fimH30-encoding clades, C1 and C2. Further
carbapenem resistance development in ST131 is a public health concern.AimThis
observational study aimed to probe the diversity of carbapenemase-producing E.
coli (CP E. coli) ST131 across England.MethodsST131 isolates were identified
using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data generated for all non-duplicate CP E.
coli from human samples submitted to the national reference laboratory from
January 2014 to June 2016. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene content and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were compared against a published ST131
phylogeny and analysed alongside patient metadata.ResultsThirty-nine genetically 
diverse ST131 CP E. coli, from eight of nine regions, represented 10% of CP E.
coli isolates sequenced. Ten and eight isolates were from the FQ-susceptible
(FQ-S) clades A and B, while eight and 15 isolates belonged to the FQ-R clades C1
or C2, respectively. Seven distinct carbapenemases were identified: KPC-2 (21
isolates, 6 regions) frequently occurred among clade C2 isolates (n = 10).
OXA-48-producers (10 isolates, 3 regions) were often from clade A (n = 5). NDM-1 
(n = 4), NDM-5 (n = 1), VIM-1 (n = 1), VIM-4 (n = 1) and OXA-181 (n = 1) were
also identified. Clade C2 isolates encoded more AMR genes than those from clades 
A (p = 0.02), B (p = 9.6 x 10-3) or C1 (p = 0.03).ConclusionWhen compared with
its global predominance among ESBL-E. coli, ST131 represented a fraction of the
CP E. coli received, belonging to diverse clades and encoding diverse
carbapenemases. The greater accumulation of resistance genes in clade C2 isolates
highlights the need for ongoing monitoring of this high-risk lineage.
