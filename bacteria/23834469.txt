Pseudomonas aeruginosa employs a characteristic pqs quorum sensing (QS) system
that functions via the signal molecules PQS and its precursor HHQ. They control
the production of a number of virulence factors and biofilm formation. Recently, 
we have shown that sulfonamide substituted 2-benzamidobenzoic acids, which are
known FabH inhibitors, are also able to inhibit PqsD, the enzyme catalyzing the
last and key step in the biosynthesis of HHQ. Here, we describe the further
optimization and characterization of this class of compounds as PqsD inhibitors. 
Structural modifications showed that both the carboxylic acid ortho to the amide 
and 3'-sulfonamide are essential for binding. Introduction of substituents in the
anthranilic part of the molecule resulted in compounds with IC50 values in the
low micromolar range. Binding mode investigations by SPR with wild-type and
mutated PqsD revealed that this compound class does not bind into the active
center of PqsD but in the ACoA channel, preventing the substrate from accessing
the active site. This binding mode was further confirmed by docking studies and
STD NMR.
