AIMS: To investigate the improved antitumour activity of SAM-3 compared with
recombinant staphylococcal enterotoxins C2 (rSEC2).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Methylthiazol tetrazolium and flow cytometry assays showed
that the antitumour activity of SAM-3 in vivo was improved because of enhanced
T-cell stimulating potency, resulting in massive activation of T cells,
particularly CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and subsequent cytokine release.
Quantitative real-time PCR assay showed that despite similar Vβ specificities
induced by rSEC2 and SAM-3, the quantities of activated T cells bearing specific 
Vβin vitro were different.
CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly suggested that the increased SAM-3-T-cell
receptor (TCR) binding affinity contributed to massive T-cell activation and
cytokine release, substantially amplifying antitumour immune response in vivo.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provided evidence for the
mechanism of SAM-3 antitumour activity improvement compared with rSEC2. Results
indicated that SAM-3 could be used as a potent powerful candidate agent for
tumour treatment in clinics.
