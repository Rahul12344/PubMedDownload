An 87-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with a 5-day history of
fever and neck pain. On physical examination, his stiff neck indicated restricted
movement, especially on rotation. CT of the head revealed calcification of the
atlantoaxial joint consistent with crowned dens syndrome, and celecoxib was
started. Four days later, he returned to our emergency department as his neck
pain and fever had not improved. Pneumonia and a urinary tract infection were
suspected. The day following admission, blood culture results were positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus A contrast-enhanced CT revealed an
upper cervical epidural abscess at the level of C1-C2. He was discharged
following 8 weeks of antibiotic treatment.
