Five men undertook two intensive interval training sessions per day for 10 days, 
followed by 5 days of active recovery. Subjects supplied a venous blood sample
and completed a mood-state questionnaire on days 1, 6, 11 and 16 of the study.
Performance capabilities were assessed on days 1, 11 and 16 using a timed
treadmill test to exhaustion at 18 kmh-1 and 1% grade. These individuals became
acutely overtrained as indicated by significant reductions in running performance
from day 1 to day 11. The overtrained state was accompanied by severe fatigue,
immune system deficits, mood disturbance, physical complaints, sleep
difficulties, and reduced appetite. Mood states moved toward baseline during
recovery, but feelings of fatigue and immune system deficits persisted throughout
the study.
