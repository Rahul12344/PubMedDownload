Despite being banned in many countries, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and
its metabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and
dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) continue to be found in fish tissues at
concentrations of concern. Like o,p -DDT, o,p -DDE is estrogenic and is believed 
to exert its effects through binding to the estrogen receptor. The limited
toxicologic data for o,p -DDE suggest that it decreases fecundity and fertility
of fishes. We conducted an egg injection study using the d-rR strain of medaka
and environmentally relevant concentrations of o,p -DDE to examine its effects on
sexual differentiation and development. The gonads of exposed fish showed no
evidence of sex reversal or intersex. However, other gonad abnormalities occurred
in exposed individuals. Females exhibited few vitellogenic oocytes and increased 
atresia. Male testes appeared morphologically normal but were very small.
Gonadosomatic index values for both sexes were lower for exposed fish. Our
observations of abnormal female and very small male gonads after in ovo o,p -DDE 
exposure may be indicative of effects on early endocrine processes important for 
normal ovarian and testicular development.
