An amylase and lipase producing bacterium (strain C2) was enriched and isolated
from soil regularly contaminated with olive washing wastewater in Sfax, Tunisia. 
Cell was aerobic, mesophilic, Gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating bacterium,
capable of growing optimally at pH 7 and 30°C and tolerated maximally 10% (W/V)
NaCl. The predominant fatty acids were found to be C(18:1)ω7c (32.8%), C(16:1)ω7c
(27.3%) and C16:0 (23.1%). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed
that this strain belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. Strain C2 was found to be
closely related to Pseudomonas luteola with more than 99% of similarity. Amylase 
optimization extraction was carried out using Box Behnken Design (BBD). Its
maximal activity was found when the pH and temperature ranged from 5.5 to 6.5 and
from 33 to 37°C, respectively. Under these conditions, amylase activity was found
to be about 9.48 U/ml.
