The ubiquitination levels of protein substrates in eukaryotic cells are
delicately orchestrated by various protein cofactors and enzymes. Dendritic
cell-derived ubiquitin (Ub)-like protein (DC-UbP), also named as Ub
domain-containing protein 2 (UBTD2), is a potential Ub shuttle protein comprised 
of a Ub-like (UbL) domain and a Ub-binding domain (UBD), but its biological
function remains largely unknown. We identified two Ub-related enzymes, the
deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 and the Ub-activating enzyme UbE1, as interacting
partners of DC-UbP from HEK 293T cells. Biochemical studies revealed that the
tandem UBA domains of USP5 and the C-terminal Ub-fold domain (UFD) of UbE1
directly interacted with the C-terminal UbL domain of DC-UbP but on the distinct 
surfaces. Overexpression of DC-UbP in HEK 293T cells enhanced the association of 
these two enzymes and thus prompted cellular ubiquitination, whereas knockdown of
the protein reduced the cellular ubiquitination level. Together, DC-UbP may
integrate the functions of USP5 and UbE1 through interacting with them, and thus 
reconcile the cellular ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes.
