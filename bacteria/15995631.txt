The present work was AIMED on the study of patterns of human beta-defensin-2
(hBD-2) expression in human gastric tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17 samples of
surgically resected human gastric adenocarcinoma paired with respective normal
tissue controls have been analyzed for the expression of hBD-2 by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR and by immunohistochemical analysis using anti-hBD-2
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated against recombinant hBD-2 by standard
hybridoma technology.
RESULTS: The hyperexpression of hBD-2 on mRNA and protein levels was registered
in 6 from 17 gastric tumor samples compared to respective controls; however,
hBD-2 expression patterns seems not be related to the differentiation grade and
stage of tumors and the presence of anti-Helicobacter pylori-antibodies in the
blood serum of the patients.
CONCLUSION: In human gastric adenocarcinomas expression of hBDs possesses
heterogeneic character; the research on larger cohort of the patients with
gastric cancer should be further performed.
