FLT3 mutations are prevalent in AML patients and confer poor prognosis.
Crenolanib, a potent type I pan-FLT3 inhibitor, is effective against both
internal tandem duplications and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain
mutations. While crenolanib monotherapy has demonstrated clinical benefit in
heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory AML patients, responses are transient and 
relapse eventually occurs. Here, toÂ investigate the mechanisms of crenolanib
resistance, we perform whole exome sequencing of AML patient samples before and
after crenolanib treatment. Unlike other FLT3 inhibitors, crenolanib does not
induce FLT3 secondary mutations, and mutations of the FLT3 gatekeeper residue are
infrequent. Instead, mutations of NRAS and IDH2 arise, mostly as FLT3-independent
subclones, while TET2 and IDH1 predominantly co-occur with FLT3-mutant clones and
are enriched in crenolanib poor-responders. The remaining patients exhibit
post-crenolanib expansion of mutations associated with epigenetic regulators,
transcription factors, and cohesion factors, suggesting diverse
genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of crenolanib resistance. Drug combinations in
experimental models restore crenolanib sensitivity.
