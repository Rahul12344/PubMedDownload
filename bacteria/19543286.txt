The direct detection of antigen-specific T cells using tetramers of soluble
peptide-major histocompatibilty complex (pMHC) molecules is widely used in both
basic and clinical immunology. However, the number of specificities that can be
assessed simultaneously has been a major limitation. Here we describe and
validate a method using combinations of fluorescent pMHC tetramers to
simultaneously detect and enrich for many (>or=15) T-cell specificities in a
single human blood sample.
