BACKGROUND: Osteoblasts possess strong growth modulatory activity on
haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. We sought to characterise the growth
and differentiation modulatory activities of human osteoblasts at distinct stages
of maturation on cord blood (CB) progenitors in the context of osteoblast
conditioned medium (OCM).
METHODS: OCM was produced from MSC-derived osteoblasts (M-OST) at distinct stages
of maturation. The growth modulatory activities of the OCM were tested on CB
CD34+ cells using different functional assays.
RESULTS: OCMs raised the growth of CB cells and expansion of CD34+ cells
independently of the maturation status of M-OST. However, productions of immature
CB cells including committed and multipotent progenitors were superior with OCM
produced with immature osteoblasts. Osteogenic differentiation was accompanied by
the upregulation of IGFBP-2, by several members of the Angpt-L family of growth
factor, and by the Notch ligands Dll-1 and Dll-4. However, the growth activity of
OCM and the in vivo engraftment properties of OCM-expanded CB cells were retained
after IGFBP-2 neutralisation. Similarly, OCM-mediated expansion of CB myeloid
progenitors was largely independent of Notch signalling.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that immature osteoblasts possess greater 
regulatory activity over haematopoietic progenitors, and that this activity is
not entirely dependent on Notch signalling.
