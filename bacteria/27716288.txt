BACKGROUND: Natural products are valuable sources for anticancer agents. In the
present study, methylferulate (MF) was identified for the first time from Tamarix
aucheriana. Spectral data were used for identification of MF. The potential of MF
to control cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), cancer cell invasion, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) DNA-binding
activity and proteasomal activities, as well as the enhancement of
chemosensitivity in human colorectal cancer cells, were evaluated. The possible
molecular mechanism of MF's therapeutic efficacy was also assessed.
METHODS: Column chromatography and spectral data were used for isolation and
identification of MF. MTT, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, in vitro invasion,
fluoremetry, EIA and Real time qPCR were used to measure antiproliferative,
chemo-sensitizing effects and other biochemical parameters.
RESULTS: MF showed a dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect on colorectal
cancer cells (IC50 = 1.73 - 1.9 mM) with a nonsignificant cytotoxicity toward
normal human fibroblast. Colony formation inhibition (P ≤ 0.001, 0.0001)
confirmed the growth inhibition by MF. MF arrested cell cycle progression in the 
S and G2/M phases; induced apoptosis and ROS generation; and inhibited NF-kB
DNA-binding activity, proteasomal activities and cell invasion in colorectal
cancer cells. MF up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p19 INK4D,
p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1), pro-apoptotic gene expression (Bax, Bad, Apaf1, Bid, Bim,
Smac) and caspases (caspase 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9). Moreover, MF down-regulated
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk1, Cdk2) and anti-apoptotic gene expression
(c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, Bcl2,FLIP). In addition, MF differentially potentiated the
sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to standard chemotherapeutic drugs.
CONCLUSION: MF showed a multifaceted anti-proliferative and chemosensitizing
effects. These results suggest the chemotherapeutic and co-adjuvant potential of 
MF.
