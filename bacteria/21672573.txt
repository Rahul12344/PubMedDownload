We reported previously that CCR9 was neuroprotective in the mouse hippocampal
neurons. This study was aimed to investigate if thymus-expressed chemokine
(TECK)/CCL25 could promote survival of PC12 cells though its receptor CCR9.
pEGFP-N1/CCR9 recombinant was constructed and transfected into PC12 cells. Along 
with this, 50 nM NGF was used to induce PC12 cells to differentiate into
sympathetic-like neurons. We show here that under serum-free conditions and
within a concentration range (50-200 nM), TECK rescued pEGFP-N1/CCR9 transfected 
PC12 cells from undergoing apoptosis in serum-free medium; however, it did not
exert a similar effect on the cells in the control. On the other hand, the PC12
cells succumbed to a higher concentration of TECK (≥ 300 nM). Bim expression was 
up-regulated in PC12 cells cultured in serum-free medium in the absence of
factors or with anti-TECK+TECK; however, it was not up-regulated in TECK-treated 
PC12 cells. p-Akt was detected at 15 min which lasted for at least 60 min when
PC12 cells were cultured in serum-free medium with TECK. Additionally, it was
shown that such an effect was effectively blocked by PI3K inhibitor, Wortmannin. 
These data suggest that TECK promotes survival of serum-deprived PC12 cells
through its receptor, CCR9, most likely via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
