The increasing emergence of pathogenic bacterial strains with high resistance to 
antibiotic therapy has created an urgent need for the development of new
antibacterial agents that are directed towards novel targets. We have focused our
attention on the Mur ligases (MurC-F), which catalyze the early steps of
bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and which to date represent under-exploited
targets for antibacterial drug design. We show that some of our phosphinate
inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl:D-glutamate ligase (MurD) also
inhibits UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate:L-lysine ligase (MurE). To
obtain new information on their structure-activity relationships, three new,
structurally related phosphinates were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition
of MurD and MurE.
