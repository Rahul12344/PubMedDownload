PCBs and environmental contamination.

Klein W, Weisgerber I.

A survey is given on reported PCB-residues and accumulation in various
environmental media including water and aquatic environment, flora, animals,
food, and humans. Model studies with technical PCB, as well as with pure
individual components, are presented from various working groups. As examples,
metabolic studies and photochemical experiments are discussed. According to our
present knowledge, a major metabolic pathway in animals and plants is
hydroxylation, often followed by methylation or conjugation. By UV-irradiation,
however, oxygenation, dechlorination and chlorination, polymerization and
isomerization may occur.
