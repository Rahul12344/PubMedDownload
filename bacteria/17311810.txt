A vector system is presented that allows generation of E. coli co-expression
clones by a standardized, robust cloning procedure. The number of co-expressed
proteins is not limited. Five 'pQLink' vectors for expression of His-tag and
GST-tag fusion proteins as well as untagged proteins and for cloning by
restriction enzymes or Gateway cloning were generated. The vectors allow proteins
to be expressed individually; to achieve co-expression, two pQLink plasmids are
combined by ligation-independent cloning. pQLink co-expression plasmids can
accept an unrestricted number of genes. As an example, the co-expression of a
heterotetrameric human transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex from a single
plasmid, its isolation and analysis of its stoichiometry are shown. pQLink clones
can be used directly for pull-down experiments if the proteins are expressed with
different tags. We demonstrate pull-down experiments of human valosin-containing 
protein (VCP) with fragments of the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR).
The cloning method avoids PCR or gel isolation of restriction fragments, and a
single resistance marker and origin of replication are used, allowing
over-expression of rare tRNAs from a second plasmid. It is expected that
applications are not restricted to bacteria, but could include co-expression in
other hosts such as Bacluovirus/insect cells.
