The UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase of Escherichia coli is responsible for 
the addition of the first amino acid of the peptide moiety in the assembly of the
monomer unit of peptidoglycan. It catalyzes the formation of the amide bond
between UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc) and L-alanine. The
UDP-MurNAc-L-alanine ligase was overproduced 2000-fold in a strain harboring a
recombinant plasmid (pAM1005) with the murC gene under the control of the
inducible promoter trc. The murC gene product appears as a 50-kDa protein
accounting for ca. 50% of total cell proteins. A two-step purification led to 1 g
of a homogeneous protein from an 8-liter culture. The N-terminal sequence of the 
purified protein correlated with the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The
stability of the enzymatic activity is strictly dependent on the presence of
2-mercaptoethanol. The K(m) values for substrates UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid,
L-alanine, and ATP were estimated; 100, 20, and 450 microM, respectively. The
specificity of the enzyme for its substrates was investigated with various
analogues. Preliminary experiments attempting to elucidate the enzymatic
mechanism were consistent with the formation of an acylphosphate intermediate.
