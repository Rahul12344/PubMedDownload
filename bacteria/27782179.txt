Today, it is considered state-of-the-art to engineer living organisms for various
biotechnology applications. Even though this has led to numerous scientific
breakthroughs, the enclosed interior of bacterial cells still restricts
interactions with enzymes, pathways and products due to the mass-transfer barrier
formed by the cell envelope. To promote accessibility, we propose engineering of 
biocatalytic reactions and subsequent product deposition directly on the
bacterial surface. As a proof-of-concept, we used the AIDA autotransporter
vehicle for Escherichia coli surface expression of tyrosinase and fully oxidized 
externally added tyrosine to the biopolymer melanin. This resulted in a color
change and creation of a black cell exterior. The capture of ninety percent of a 
pharmaceutical wastewater pollutant followed by regeneration of the cell bound
melanin matrix through a simple pH change, shows the superior function and
facilitated processing provided by the surface methodology. The broad adsorption 
spectrum of melanin could also allow removal of other micropollutants.
