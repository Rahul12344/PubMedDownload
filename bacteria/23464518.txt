TGF-β was originally considered as an immunoregulatory cytokine, but accumulating
data demonstrate that it also plays a critical role in development of effector
immunity. Since TGF- β has a potent ability to alter immune responses, modulation
of the TGF-β pathway for treatment of transplantation patients could be effective
if carried out in a target selective manner. This review will focus on the role
of TGF-β in T cell differentiation and discuss the prospect of TGF-β as the
therapeutic target of lung transplantation acceptance.
