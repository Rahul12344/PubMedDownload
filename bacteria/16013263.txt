For the purpose of detecting the HBD-2 expression at protein level, the
recombinant prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-1lambdaT-HBD-2 was constructed and
the E. coli-based product of GST-HBD-2 fusion protein was prepared. When rabbit
was immunized with the fusion protein, the anti-serum against HBD-2 was produced.
After caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation, high titer of specific
polyclonal antibody against HBD-2, which was detected by ELISA and Western blot, 
was obtained. This result suggests that recombinant peptide fusion protein could 
be used instead of the conjugate of peptide-albumin or peptide-thyroid globulin
to produce antibody. The obtained antibodies could be used for revealing the
tissue distribution of HBD-2 and the regulation of its gene expression.
