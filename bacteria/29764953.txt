Antibiotics and vaccines have greatly impacted human health in the last century
by dramatically reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious
diseases. The recent challenge posed by the emergence of multidrug-resistant
bacteria could possibly be addressed by novel immune prophylactic and therapeutic
approaches. Among the newly threatening pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae is
particularly worrisome in the nosocomial setting, and its surface polysaccharides
are regarded as promising antigen candidates. The majority of Klebsiella
carbapenem-resistant strains belong to the sequence type 158 (ST258) lineage,
with two main clades expressing capsular polysaccharides CPS1 and CPS2. In a
recent article, S. D. Kobayashi and colleagues (mBio 9:e00297-18, 2018,
https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00297-18) show that CPS2-specific IgGs render ST258 
clade 2 bacteria more sensitive to human serum and phagocytic killing. E.
Diago-Navarro et al. (mBio 9:e00091-18, 2018,
https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00091-18) generated two murine monoclonal antibodies
recognizing distinct glycotopes of CPS2 that presented functional activity
against multiple ST258 strains. These complementary studies represent a step
toward the control of this dangerous pathogen.
