BACKGROUND: An important portion of asthmatics do not respond to current
therapies. Thus, the need for new therapeutic drugs is urgent. We have
demonstrated a critical role for PARP in experimental asthma. Olaparib, a PARP
inhibitor, was recently introduced in clinical trials against cancer. The
objective of the present study was to examine the efficacy of olaparib in
blocking established allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness similar
to those observed in human asthma in animal models of the disease.
METHODS: We used ovalbumin (OVA)-based mouse models of asthma and primary CD4(+) 
T cells. C57BL/6J WT or PARP-1(-/-) mice were subjected to OVA sensitization
followed by a single or multiple challenges to aerosolized OVA or left
unchallenged. WT mice were administered, i.p., 1 mg/kg, 5 or 10 mg/kg of olaparib
or saline 30 min after each OVA challenge.
RESULTS: Administration of olaparib in mice 30 min post-challenge promoted a
robust reduction in airway eosinophilia, mucus production and hyperresponsiveness
even after repeated challenges with ovalbumin. The protective effects of olaparib
were linked to a suppression of Th2 cytokines eotaxin, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13,
and M-CSF, and ovalbumin-specific IgE with an increase in the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ.
These traits were associated with a decrease in splenic CD4(+) T cells and
concomitant increase in T-regulatory cells. The aforementioned traits conferred
by olaparib administration were consistent with those observed in OVA-challenged 
PARP-1(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfer of Th2-skewed OT-II-WT CD4(+) T cells
reversed the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, the chemokine GM-CSF, the Th1
cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ, and ovalbumin-specific IgE production in
ovalbumin-challenged PARP-1(-/-)mice suggesting a role for PARP-1 in CD4(+) T but
not B cells. In ex vivo studies, PARP inhibition by olaparib or PARP-1 gene
knockout markedly reduced CD3/CD28-stimulated gata-3 and il4 expression in
Th2-skewed CD4(+) T cells while causing a moderate elevation in t-bet and ifn-γ
expression in Th1-skewed CD4(+) T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the potential of PARP inhibition as a viable
therapeutic strategy and olaparib as a likely candidate to be tested in human
asthma clinical trials.
