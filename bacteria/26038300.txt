Deficiencies in the classical pathway of complement activation have some common
features but show also great differences. Deficiencies of each of the components 
(C1q, C1s, C1r, C4 and C2) imply increased susceptibility to bacterial
infections. They are also associated with increased risk to develop systemic
lupus erythematosus where deficiency of C1q is strongly associated to the disease
while C4 less and C2 much less. Deficiency of C1q affects only activation of the 
classical pathway while deficiency of C4 and C2 also prevent activation of the
lectin pathway. Bypass mechanisms may result in complement activation also in
absence of C2 but not in absence of C1q or C4. The genes for C2 and C4 isotypes
are closely located within the MHC class III region on chromosome 6p and the
genes for the 3 C1q chains are on chromosome 1p. Deficiencies of C1q and of C4
show genetic heterogeneity while deficiency of C2 in the great majority of cases 
is caused by a specific deletion. The production of C4 and C2 is mainly by the
hepatocytes in the liver while C1q is produced by monocytic bone marrow derived
cells. This has implications for the possibility to treat the deficiency and
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been tried in C1q deficiency.
