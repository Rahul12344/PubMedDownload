The SGNH hydrolase family includes enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a
broad range of substrates. Here, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray
crystallographic studies of a novel SGNH hydrolase (Est24) from Sinorhizobium
meliloti were performed. Recombinant Est24 protein containing an N-terminal His
tag was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Est24 was then
crystallized using a solution consisting of 0.2 M ammonium phosphate pH 4.6, 20% 
polyethylene glycol 3350. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution
of 1.45 Å with an R(merge) of 9.4%. The Est24 crystals belonged to space group
C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 129.09, b = 88.63, c = 86.15 Å, α = 90.00, β = 
114.30, γ = 90.00°. A molecular-replacement solution was obtained using the
crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis arylesterase as a template and
structure refinement of Est24 is in progress.
