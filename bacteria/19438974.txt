BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) are continually
exposed to oral bacteria and to other harmful agents. Their responses to stimuli 
are critical in maintaining periodontal homeostasis. The aim of this study was to
investigate the modulating effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on the innate 
immune responses of HGECs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression of HGECs was determined
by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect of CSE or
nicotine on the expression of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin-2
(hBD-2) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 in stimulated HGEC
cultures was evaluated by RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The HGECs expressed mRNA of TLRs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and minimally of 
TLR4, but not of TLRs 7 or 8. Stimulation of HGECs with highly purified TLR2, 3
or 5 ligands led to expression of hBD-2 and of IL-8. Enhancement of hBD-2 and
IL-8 was observed in HGECs after combined stimulation with Porphyromonas
gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (TLR2 ligand) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha,
compared with stimulation using either agent alone. After CSE exposure, hBD-2
expression was markedly reduced in stimulated HGEC cultures, whereas IL-8
expression was markedly increased. These effects were also observed, but were
markedly attenuated, upon nicotine treatment.
CONCLUSION: Human gingival epithelial cells play a critical role in orchestrating
the innate immune responses of periodontal tissue via TLR signalling. Our results
represent the first demonstration that CSE can modulate HGEC function by
suppressing hBD-2 and enhancing IL-8 production, and this may be, in part, a
possible mechanism which promotes periodontal disease.
