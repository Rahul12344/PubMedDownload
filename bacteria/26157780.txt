BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A is caused by heterogeneous mutations in F8. Coagulation 
factor VIII (FVIII), the product of F8, is composed of multiple domains
designated A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. FVIII is known to interact with diverse proteins,
and this characteristic may be important for hemostasis. However, little is known
about domain-specific functions or their specific binding partners.
METHODS: To determine F8 domain-specific functions during blood coagulation, the 
FVIII domains A1, A2, A3, and C were cloned from Hep3B hepatocytes.
Domain-specific recombinant polypeptides were glutathione S-transferase (GST)- or
polyhistidine (His)-tagged, over-expressed in bacteria, and purified by specific 
affinity chromatography.
RESULTS: Recombinant polypeptides of predicted sizes were obtained. The
GST-tagged A2 polypeptide interacted with coagulation factor IX, which is known
to bind the A2 domain of activated FVIII.
CONCLUSION: Recombinant, domain-specific polypeptides are useful tools to study
the domain-specific functions of FVIII during the coagulation process, and they
may be used for production of domain-specific antibodies.
