Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a homohexameric ATPase involved in a
multitude cellular processes and it was recently shown that VCP is trimethylated 
at lysine 315 by the VCP lysine methyltransferase (VCPKMT). Here, we generated
and validated a constitutive knockout mouse by targeting exon 1-4 of the Vcpkmt
gene. We show that Vcpkmt is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined and
confirm the sub-cellular localization to the cytoplasm. We show by (I) mass
spectrometric analysis, (II) VCPKMT-mediated in vitro methylation of VCP in cell 
extracts and (III) immunostaining with a methylation specific antibody, that in
Vcpkmt-/- mice the methylation of lysine 315 in VCP is completely abolished. In
contrast, VCP is almost exclusively trimethylated in wild-type mice. Furthermore,
we investigated the specificity of VCPKMT with in vitro methylation assays using 
as source of substrate protein extracts from Vcpkmt-/- mouse organs or three
human Vcpkmt-/- cell lines. The results show that VCPKMT is a highly specific
enzyme, and suggest that VCP is its sole substrate. The Vcpkmt-/- mice were
viable, fertile and had no obvious pathological phenotype. Their body weight,
life span and acute endurance capacity were comparable to wild-type controls.
Overall the results show that VCPKMT is an enzyme required for methylation of
K315 of VCP in vivo, but VCPKMT is not essential for development or survival
under unstressed conditions.
