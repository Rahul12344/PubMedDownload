CD2-CD48 interactions enhance T cell receptor-driven mouse T lymphocyte
activation. However, the mechanism is not well understood. Here we show that
blockade of CD2-CD48 interactions with anti-CD48 monoclonal antibody (mAb)
inhibited interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma expression, as well as T 
cell proliferation in response to mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb, although more potent
inhibition resulted from blocking CD28-CD80/CD86 interactions. Blockade of both
CD2 and CD28 costimulation abrogated T cell proliferation and cytokine synthesis.
Conversely, T cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD2 mAb
exhibited increased proliferation and IL-2 and IFN-gamma expression, although a
stronger enhancing effect was obtained with immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28
mAb. Concurrent CD2 and CD28 costimulation caused a further increase in
proliferation and cytokine synthesis. Stimulation of purified T cells with
microsphere-immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD2 mAb increased IL-2 and IFN-gamma
mRNA stability. However, CD28 costimulation had a stronger enhancing effect on
IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA stability that was not further increased by concomitant
CD2 signaling. CD2, therefore, costimulates T cell activation by stabilizing
cytokine mRNA transcripts, albeit with less efficiency than CD28.
