Although the importance of B cells in the host immune response upon Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection has been recognized, a conclusive role for B cells has yet
to be determined. In the present study, we found that primary CD19(+) B cells
isolated from patients with tuberculosis significantly inhibited Th17, but not
Th1, cell activation. Moreover, the suppressive activity was mediated by a
CD19(+)CD1d(+)CD5(+) B cell population. Notably, patients with tuberculosis were 
found to have significantly higher frequencies of CD19(+)CD1d(+)CD5(+) B cells
with stronger suppressive activity than such cells from healthy donors.
Furthermore, the frequency of CD19(+)CD1d(+)CD5(+) B cells in peripheral blood
was inversely correlated with that of Th17 cells in patients with tuberculosis.
This finding that B cells negatively regulate Th17 responses provides a novel
mechanism in the regulation of CD4(+) T cell responses-aside from regulatory T
cells-during M. tuberculosis infection, which may impact the clinical outcome of 
tuberculosis.
