In the Mediterranean area, salted and dried roe from the gray Mugil cephalus
"bottarga" represent a speciality food with great commercial value. Bottarga is
currently produced by a traditional handmade process and, the risk of human
bacterial contamination during its manufacturing is still unknown; in this
perspective the foodborne pathogen Staphylococcus aureus could potentially
contaminate this product due to poor sanitation or bad handling during
processing. The aim of this work is: to evaluate the contamination level of
foodborne pathogens at different product manufacturing stages and, in addition,
to describe a fast and realizable method for the rapid detection of S. aureus in 
bottarga samples in the field. A cultural procedure was initially used to
investigate the occurrence of S. aureus and the other main foodborne pathogens in
bottarga samples at the different manufacturing stages (from roe to final
product). In addition, a molecular approach was used to rapidly determine the
presence of total bacteria, S. aureus, and its potential toxigenicity. Of the 194
specimens analyzed, we identified: Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus spp. and
Enterobacteriaceae. However, some samples resulted as being contaminated with S. 
aureus (4% in roe and 8.7% in the final product). During the bottarga
manufacturing process, we observed an increase in pathogen levels (from 10(2) to 
10(5) CFU/g) in contaminated samples, and entA and entB genotypes were
identified. Reconstruction experiments suggest that the fresh roe and the
bottarga (not completely dried) could represent a risk for the contamination and 
growth of pathogen bacteria.
