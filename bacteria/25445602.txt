Listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen, causes high mortality
rate of listeriosis. Pan-genomic comparisons revealed the species genome of L.
monocytogenes is highly stable but not completely clonal. The population
structure of this species displays at least four evolutionary lineages (I-IV).
Isolates of different lineages displayed distinct genetic, phenotypic and
ecologic characteristics, which appear to affect their ability to be transmitted 
through foods and to cause human disease, as well as their ability to thrive in
markedly phage-rich environments. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
palindrome repeats), a recently described adaptive immunity system, not only
confers defense against invading elements derived from bacteriophages or plasmids
in many bacteria and archaeal, but also displays strains-level variations in
almost any given endowed species. This work was aimed to investigate CRISPR
diversity in L. monocytogenes strains of different lineages and estimated the
potential practicability of the CRISPR-based approach to resolve this species'
biodiversity. Only a third of strains contained all three CRISPR loci (here
defined as LMa, LMb and LMc) at same time. Combined the strain-level variations
in presence/absence of each CRISPR locus and its relative size and spacer
arrangements, a total of 29 CRISPR genotypes and 11 groups were defined within a 
collection of 128 strains covering all serotypes. The CRISPR-based approach
showed powerful ability to subtype the more commonly food-borne isolates of
serotype 1/2a (lineage II) and serotypes 1/2b (lineage I), but limited by the
absence of typical CRISPR structure in many lineage I isolates. Strikingly, we
found a long associated cas1 gene as well as two self-targeting LMb spacers
accidently homologous with endogenous genes in a fraction of serotype 1/2a
isolations, demonstrated that CRISPR I B system might involve in bacterial
physiology besides antiviral immunity.
