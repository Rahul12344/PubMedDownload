We have previously shown that differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells
leads to both increased binding of FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and suppression
of k-FGF expression. In the current study, we examined the expression of FGF
receptors by EC cells, EC-derived differentiated cells and early mammalian
embryos using the technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). We determined that both mouse, F9, and human, NT2/D1, EC cells as well 
as their differentiated counterparts express transcripts for two forms of FGF
receptors, bek (bacterially expressed kinase) and flg (fms-like gene). In
addition, we determined that mouse blastocysts express flg transcripts. The
presence of FGF receptor transcripts in early embryos and the previous finding of
FGF-related activity in medium conditioned by mouse blastocysts argue that the
FGF family plays important roles during early mammalian development.
