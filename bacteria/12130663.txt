The chemokines use G protein-coupled receptors to regulate the migratory and
proadhesive responses of leukocytes. Based on observations that G protein-coupled
receptors undergo heterologous desensitization, we have examined the ability of
chemokines to also influence the perception of pain by cross-desensitizing opioid
G protein-coupled receptors function in vitro and in vivo. We find that the
chemotactic activities of both mu- and delta-opioid receptors are desensitized
following activation of the chemokine receptors CCR5, CCR2, CCR7, and CXCR4 but
not of the CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptors. Furthermore, we also find that pretreatment 
with RANTES/CCL5, the ligand for CCR1, and CCR5 or SDF-1alpha/CXCL12, the ligand 
for CXCR4, followed by opioid administration into the periaqueductal gray matter 
of the brain results in an increased rat tail flick response to a painful
stimulus. Because chemokine administration into the periaqueductal gray matter
inhibits opioid-induced analgesia, we propose that the activation of
proinflammatory chemokine receptors down-regulates the analgesic functions of
opioid receptors, and this enhances the perception of pain at inflammatory sites.
