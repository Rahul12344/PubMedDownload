Outbreaks of infections by rapidly growing mycobacteria following invasive
procedures, such as ophthalmological, laparoscopic, arthroscopic, plastic, and
cardiac surgeries, mesotherapy, and vaccination, have been detected in Brazil
since 1998. Members of the Mycobacterium chelonae-Mycobacterium abscessus group
have caused most of these outbreaks. As part of an epidemiological investigation,
the isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In this
project, we performed a large-scale comparison of PFGE profiles with the results 
of a recently developed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for M.
abscessus. Ninety-three isolates were analyzed, with 40 M. abscessus subsp.
abscessus isolates, 47 M. abscessus subsp. bolletii isolates, and six isolates
with no assigned subspecies. Forty-five isolates were obtained during five
outbreaks, and 48 were sporadic isolates that were not associated with outbreaks.
For MLST, seven housekeeping genes (argH, cya, glpK, gnd, murC, pta, and purH)
were sequenced, and each isolate was assigned a sequence type (ST) from the
combination of obtained alleles. The PFGE patterns of DraI-digested DNA were
compared with the MLST results. All isolates were analyzable by both methods.
Isolates from monoclonal outbreaks showed unique STs and indistinguishable or
very similar PFGE patterns. Thirty-three STs and 49 unique PFGE patterns were
identified among the 93 isolates. The Simpson's index of diversity values for
MLST and PFGE were 0.69 and 0.93, respectively, for M. abscessus subsp. abscessus
and 0.96 and 0.97, respectively, for M. abscessus subsp. bolletii. In conclusion,
the MLST scheme showed 100% typeability and grouped monoclonal outbreak isolates 
in agreement with PFGE, but it was less discriminative than PFGE for M.
abscessus.
