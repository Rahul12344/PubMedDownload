Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a specialized subset of T lymphocytes that
regulate immune responses in the context of autoimmunity, cancer, and microbial
infection. Lipid antigens derived from bacteria, parasites, and fungi can be
presented by CD1d molecules and recognized by the canonical T cell receptors on
NKT cells. Alternatively, NKT cells can be activated through recognition of
self-lipids and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines generated during infection. Unlike 
conventional T cells, only a small subset of NKT cells traffic through the lymph 
nodes under homeostatic conditions, with the largest NKT cell populations
localizing to the liver, lungs, spleen, and bone marrow. This is thought to be
mediated by differences in chemokine receptor expression profiles. However, the
impact of infection on the tissue localization and function of NKT remains
largely unstudied. This review focuses on the mechanisms mediating the
establishment of peripheral NKT cell populations during homeostasis and how
tissue localization of NKT cells is affected during infection.
