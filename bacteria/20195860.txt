A Lactobacillus brevis strain with the ability to synthesize butanol from glucose
was constructed by metabolic engineering. The genes crt, bcd, etfB, etfA, and
hbd, composing the bcs-operon, and the thl gene encode the enzymes of the lower
part of the clostridial butanol pathway (crotonase, butyryl-CoA-dehydrogenase,
two subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase, and thiolase) of Clostridium acetobutylicum. They were cloned into
the Gram-positive/Gram-negative shuttle plasmid vector pHYc. The two resulting
plasmids pHYc-thl-bcs and pHYc-bcs (respectively, with and without the
clostridial thl gene) were transferred to Escherichia coli and L. brevis. The
recombinant L. brevis strains were able to synthesize up to 300 mg l(-1) or 4.1
mM of butanol on a glucose-containing medium. A L. brevis strain carrying the
clostridial bcs-operon has the ability to synthesize butanol with participation
of its own thiolase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. The
particular role of the enzymes involved in butanol production and the suitability
of L. brevis as an n-butanol producer are discussed.
