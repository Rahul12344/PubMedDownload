A subpopulation of T cells harbors a suppressor phenotype and can significantly
dampen autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. These regulatory T (Treg)
cells, which can arise naturally in the thymus and encompass a CD25+CD4+ T-cell
repertoire or be antigenically induced, are central players in the maintenance of
self-tolerance. A plethora of O-cell costimulatory and accessory receptor
molecules expressed by Treg and/or non-regulatory T cells, such as GITR, OX40,
and CTLA-4, are involved in modulating the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune
disorders, transplant rejection, and tumor immunity, as well as the control of
infections. Exciting new evidence shows that O-cell costimulators, some of which 
are identified as hopeful discriminative Treg-cell markers, appear to mediate
Treg-cell homeostasis and function. Understanding the biological significance of 
the O-cell costimulatory molecules and the accessory molecules expressed by Treg 
cells is a prerequisite to better characterizing this regulatory T-cell
population. We provide a synopsis of the current understanding of several
costimulatory molecules that can orchestrate the function of both naturally
arising and antigen-inducible Treg cells.
