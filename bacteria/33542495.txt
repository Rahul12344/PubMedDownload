Human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells play an essential role during bacterial
infections of the airways by sensing pathogens and orchestrating protective
immune responses. We here sought to determine which metabolic pathways are
utilized by HBE cells to mount innate immune responses upon exposure to a
relevant bacterial agonist. Stimulation of HBE cells by the bacterial component
flagellin triggered activation of the mTOR pathway resulting in an increased
glycolytic flux that sustained the secretory activity of immune mediators by HBE 
cells. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin impeded glycolysis and limited
flagellin-induced secretion of immune mediators. The role of the mTOR pathway was
recapitulated in vivo in a mouse model of flagellin-triggered lung innate immune 
responses. These data demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming via the mTOR
pathway modulates activation of the respiratory epithelium, identifying mTOR as a
potential therapeutic target to modulate mucosal immunity in the context of
bacterial infections.
