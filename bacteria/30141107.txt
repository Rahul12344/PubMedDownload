Clostridium acetobutylicum is a natural producer of butanol, butyrate, acetone
and ethanol. The pattern of metabolites reflects the partitioning of redox
equivalents between hydrogen and carbon metabolites. Here the exogenous genes of 
ferredoxin-NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (FdNR) and trans-enoyl-coenzyme reductase (TER)
are introduced to three different Clostridium acetobutylicum strains to
investigate the distribution of redox equivalents and butanol productivity. The
FdNR improves NAD(P)H availability by capturing reducing power from ferredoxin. A
butanol production of 9.01Â g/L (36.9% higher than the control), and the highest
ratios of butanol/acetate (7.02) and C4/C2 (3.17) derived metabolites were
obtained in the C acetobutylicum buk- strain expressing FdNR. While the TER
functions as an NAD(P)H oxidase, butanol production was decreased in the C.
acetobutylicum strains containing TER. The results illustrate that metabolic flux
can be significantly changed and directed into butanol or butyrate due to
enhancement of NAD(P)H availability by controlling electron flow through the
ferredoxin node.
