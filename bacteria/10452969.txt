NK T cells recognize glycolipid Ags such as alpha-galactosylceramide
(alpha-GalCer) presented by the MHC class I-like molecule CD1d. In this paper we 
have studied the in vivo effects of alpha-GalCer on the generation of adaptive
immune responses. Treatment of mice with alpha-GalCer resulted in rapid
activation of NK T cells and production of the cytokines IL-4 and IFN-gamma.
However, after this initial stimulation, NK T cells became polarized for the
production of IL-4. Further, as soon as 6 days after alpha-GalCer injection, a
marked increase in serum IgE levels was observed. Administration of alpha-GalCer 
at the time of priming of mice with protein Ag resulted in the generation of
Ag-specific Th2 cells and a profound increase in the production of IgE.
Collectively, these findings indicate that alpha-GalCer may be useful for
modulating immune responses toward a Th2 phenotype during prophylaxis and
therapy.
