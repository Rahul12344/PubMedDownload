Atomically flat mica surfaces were chemically modified with an alkyl
trifluoromethyl ketone, a covalent inhibitor of esterase 2 from Alicyclobacillus 
acidocaldarius, which served as a tag for ligand-directed immobilization of
esterase-linked proteins. Purified NADH oxidase from Thermus thermophilus and
human exportin-t from cell lysates were anchored on the modified surfaces. The
immobilization effectiveness of the proteins was studied by atomic force
microscopy (AFM). It was shown that ligand-esterase interaction allowed specific 
attachment of exportin-t and resulted in high-resolution images and coverage
patterns that were comparable with immobilized purified protein. Moreover, the
biological functionality of immobilized human exportin-t in forming a quaternary 
complex with tRNA and the GTPase Ran-GTP, and the dimension changes before and
after complex formation were also determined by AFM.
