We established a new reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography method
combined with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass
spectrometry for the simultaneous determination and structural characterization
of different lipid A types in bacteria (Escherichia coli O111, Salmonella
adelaide O35 and Proteus morganii O34) showing serological cross-reactivity. The 
complex lipid A mixtures (obtained by simple extraction and acid hydrolysis of
the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides) were separated and detected without
phosphate derivatization. Several previously unidentified ions were detected,
which differed in the number and type of acyl chains and number of phosphate
groups. In several cases, we observed the different retention of isobaric lipid A
species, which had different secondary fatty acyl distribution at the C2' or the 
C3' sites. The fragmentation of the various, C4' monophosphorylated lipid A
species in deprotonated forms provided structural assignment for each component. 
Fragmentation pathways of the tri-acylated, tetra-acylated, penta-acylated,
hexa-acylated and hepta-acylated lipid A components and of the lipid A partial
structures are suggested. As standards, the hexa-acylated ion at m/z 1716 with
the E. coli-type acyl distribution and the hepta-acylated ion at m/z 1954 with
the Salmonella-type acyl distribution were used. The results confirmed the
presence of multiple forms of lipid A in all strains analyzed. In addition, the
negative-ion mode MS permitted efficient detection for non-phosphorylated lipid A
components, too. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
