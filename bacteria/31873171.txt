Several Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) enzymes, in insects, have previously
been implicated in resistance developed against DDT and other insecticides. The
GST enzyme particularly sigma class have important physiological role in
detoxification of lipid peroxidation by-products in insects. Phlebotomus
argentipes has been intensely exposed to DDT over years due to Indoor Residual
Spray (IRS) programme for Kala-azar elimination in Bihar, India. However, in P.
argentipes, role of GSTs in DDT resistance have not been elucidated. Here, sigma 
class GST of P. argentipes (Parg-GSTσ) was successfully cloned, expressed and
purified by affinity chromatography. The recombinant Parg-GSTσ was found to be
highly active towards cumene hydroperoxide and 4-HNE having specific activity
92.47 & 203.92 µM/min/mg of protein, respectively and exhibited low activity
towards universal substrate CDNB i.e., 8.75 µM/min/mg of protein. RT-PCR and
immunoblot analysis showed at least 2 and 1.8 fold overexpression of Parg-GSTσ in
the single exposed and non exposed DDT resistant P. argentipes as compared to
susceptible, implicating Parg-GSTσ also involved in DDT resistance probably by
imparting enhanced stress tolerance. The DDT, H2O2 and temperature induction
assays demonstrated stress-dependent induction of Parg-GSTσ expression indicating
its important role in oxidative stress redressal.
