The recognition and translation of mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs are poorly
understood. To gain further insights into these processes in vivo, we
characterized mice with a missense mutation that causes loss of the translational
activator of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (TACO1). We report that TACO1 is not
required for embryonic survival, although the mutant mice have substantially
reduced COXI protein, causing an isolated complex IV deficiency. We show that
TACO1 specifically binds the mt-Co1 mRNA and is required for translation of COXI 
through its association with the mitochondrial ribosome. We determined the atomic
structure of TACO1, revealing three domains in the shape of a hook with a tunnel 
between domains 1 and 3. Mutations in the positively charged domain 1 reduce RNA 
binding by TACO1. The Taco1 mutant mice develop a late-onset visual impairment,
motor dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy and thus provide a useful model for
future treatment trials for mitochondrial disease.
