Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) performed using a laser scanning
confocal microscope is a technique with single-molecule sensitivity that is
becoming more accessible to cell biologists. In this chapter, we describe the use
of FCS for the analysis of diffusion coefficients and receptor-receptor
interactions in live cells in culture. In particular, we describe a protocol to
collect fluorescence fluctuation data from fluorescence-tagged receptors as they 
diffuse into an out of a small laser-illuminated observation volume using a
commercially available system such as the Zeiss ConfoCor 3 or LSM-780 microscope.
Autocorrelation analysis of the fluctuations in fluorescence intensity provides
information about the diffusion time and number of fluorescent molecules in the
observation volume. A photon-counting histogram can be used to examine the
relationship between fluorescence intensity and the number of fluorescent
molecules to estimate the average molecular brightness of the sample. Since
molecular brightness is directly proportional to the number of fluorescent
molecules, it can be used to monitor receptor-receptor interactions and to decode
the number of receptor monomers present in an oligomeric complex.
