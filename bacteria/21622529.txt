The population structure of the species Legionella pneumophila was investigated
by multilocus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) and
sequencing of three VNTRs (Lpms01, Lpms04 and Lpms13) in selected strains. Of 150
isolates of diverse origins, 136 (86 %) were distributed into eight large MLVA
clonal complexes (VACCs) and the rest were either unique or formed small clusters
of up to two MLVA genotypes. In spite of the lower degree of genome-wide linkage 
disequilibrium of the MLVA loci compared with sequence-based typing, the
clustering achieved by the two methods was highly congruent. The detailed
analysis of VNTR Lpms04 alleles showed a very complex organization, with five
different repeat unit lengths and a high level of internal variation. Within each
MLVA-defined VACC, Lpms04 was endowed with a common recognizable pattern with
some interesting exceptions. Evidence of recombination events was suggested by
analysis of internal repeat variations at the two additional VNTR loci, Lpms01
and Lpms13. Sequence analysis of L. pneumophila VNTR locus Lpms04 alone provides 
a first-line assay for allocation of a new isolate within the L. pneumophila
population structure and for epidemiological studies.
