CYP11B1 and the closely related CYP11B2 are involved in the production of adrenal
steroid hormones. Although in human their primary structure is 93% identical they
are involved in the biosynthesis of functionally diverse products, such as
glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, respectively. In contrast, bovine CYP11B1
combines both activities in one single enzyme. The CYP11B family belongs to class
I cytochromes P450 that have been described in bacteria and mitochondria and
receive their electrons from a low molecular weight iron sulphur protein which is
reduced by a NADPH-dependent FAD-containing reductase. In this review, we
summarise the current knowledge on the modulation of aldosterone and cortisol
synthesis by transcriptional regulation, on the molecular level as consequence of
mutations found in patients suffering from steroid hormone-related diseases as
well as introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and as consequence of
protein-protein interaction with both CYP11A1 and the natural redox partner
adrenodoxin.
