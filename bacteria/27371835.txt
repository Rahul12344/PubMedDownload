Objective To investigate the effect of secretory acid phosphatase as a virulence 
factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (SapM) on the autophagy of murine
macrophages. Methods GFP-LC3-Raw264.7 cells were treated with SapM, wortmannin,
or starvation. Then the formation of autophagosomes was observed under a
fluorescence microscope. The level of microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3 (LC3) II was detected using Western blotting. After chloroquine was added
in the SapM-treated cells, LC3II level was again tested by Western blotting.
Results Both starvation and SapM increased the number of GFP-LC3 puncta and the
level of LC3 II. There was no further increase of LC3 II level in SapM-treated
cells after chloroquine addition. Conclusion SapM can block
autophagosome-lysosome fusion and inhibit autophagy of murine macrophages.
