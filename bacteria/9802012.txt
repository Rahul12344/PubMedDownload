A chromosomal ars operon homologue of Pseudomonas aeruginosa confers increased
resistance to arsenic and antimony in Escherichia coli.

Cai J, Salmon K, DuBow MS.

Operons encoding homologous arsenic-resistance determinants (ars) have been
discovered in bacterial plasmids from Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, 
as well as in the Escherichia coli chromosome. However, evidence for this
arsenic-resistance determinant in the medically and environmentally important
bacterial species Pseudomonas aeruginosa is conflicting. Here the identification 
of a P. aeruginosa chromosomal ars operon homologue via cloning and
complementation of an E. coli ars mutant is reported. The P. aeruginosa
chromosomal ars operon contains three potential ORFs encoding proteins with
significant sequence similarity to those encoded by the arsR, arsB and arsC genes
of the plasmid-based and E. coli chromosomal ars operons. The cloned P.
aeruginosa chromosomal ars operon confers augmented resistance to arsenic and
antimony oxyanions in an E. coli arsB mutant and in wild-type P. aeruginosa.
Expression of the operon was induced by arsenite at the mRNA level. DNA sequences
homologous with this operon were detected in some, but not all, species of the
genus Pseudomonas, suggesting that its conservation follows their taxonomic-based
evolution.
