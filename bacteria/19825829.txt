Multiple Src family kinases (SFKs) are present in murine embryonic stem (mES)
cells. Whereas complete inhibition of SFK activity blocks mES cell
differentiation, sole inhibition of the SFK member c-Yes induces differentiation.
Thus, individual SFKs may have opposing roles in the regulation of mES cell fate.
To test this possibility, we generated SFK mutants with engineered resistance to 
a nonselective SFK inhibitor. The presence of an inhibitor-resistant c-Src
mutant, but not analogous mutants of Hck, Lck, c-Yes, or Fyn, reversed the
differentiation block associated with inhibitor treatment, resulting in the
formation of cells with properties of primitive ectoderm. These results show that
distinct SFK signaling pathways regulate mES cell fate and demonstrate that the
formation of primitive ectoderm is regulated by the activity of c-Src.
