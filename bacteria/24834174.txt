AIM: The purpose of this study was to characterize phenotypically and
genotypically the serotypes of the E. coli O111 associated with diarrheal disease
and assess the variation among serotypes in terms of specific virulence factors
and HeLa cells adherence patterns.
BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O111 serogroups are prevalent in endemic or sporadic
cases of diarrhea, especially in developing areas.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 54 strains of E. coli O111 isolated from
diarrheal and healthy cases were included in this study. Flagella antigens of
motile and non-motile strains were identified by fliC-RFLP method (H types) and
confirmed with agglutination test using H-specific antisera. All strains were
tested for the presence of 5 different gene regions associated with virulence
(eaeA, eaeB, bfpA, sxt and EAF plasmid) by PCR and the patterns of bacterial
attachment to HeLa cells was assayed in cell culture.
RESULTS: Of 54 E. coli O111 strains, 89% were typeable with standard H antisera
and the remaining 11% of strains were non-motile (H -). Twenty-three different H 
type were distinguished among the O111 strains by PCR-RFLP. The most common
serotypes included H21, H9, H2, H6 and H12 (48%). Serotypes O111:H9 were
represented by strains with 2 patterns of virulence genes (eaeA (+) /bfpA (+)
/EAE(+), and eaeA (+) /bfpA (-) /EAE(-) ) and serotype H14 was represented by
strains with the single eaeA (+) /bfpA (+) /EAE(-) combination. Four distinct
patterns of adherence were distinguished: LA, LLA, AA and DA. All of serotypes
with the eaeA (+) /bfpA (+) /EAE(+), or eaeA(+)/bfpA(+)/EAE(-), combination
isolated from children with diarrhea exhibited the LA pattern, and serotypes with
eaeA(+)/bfpA(-)/EAF(-) showed the LLA, while the majority of the strains isolated
from healthy cases exhibited the DA, AA and NA patterns.
CONCLUSION: Strains of this O serogroup represented a diverse of serotypes with a
variety of virulence factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis.
