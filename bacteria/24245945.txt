AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the trial umbilical 
cord blood sampling bag for unrelated cord blood transplantation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from 100 vaginal deliveries. In 50
cases, umbilical cord blood (UCB) was taken with the traditional Kawasumi type
UCB sampling bag. In another 50 cases, UCB were taken with trial UCB sampling bag
offered by NIPRO Co. We compared the sampling volume between the two groups.
Furthermore, 10 cases in each group were matched by sampling volume; we examined 
the quality of UCB on the number and concentration of nucleated cells,
mononuclear cells, CD34+ cells and colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophage and
the numbers tested positive for bacteria.
RESULTS: Whereas there were no significant differences in gestational weeks at
sampling, the ratio of primipara women to multipara women, maternal age, and
neonatal weight between the two groups, the sampling UCB volumes with the trial
sampling bag were significantly higher than those with traditional sampling bags 
(P < 0.05). In addition, this phenomenon was more significant in the latter part 
of the study period (P < 0.05). On the other hand, there were no significant
differences in the quality of UCB between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Once clinicians have become accustomed to the trial UBC sampling bag,
this method might be a useful method for collecting UCB for unrelated cord blood 
transplantation.
