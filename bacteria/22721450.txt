BACKGROUND: Asplenic individuals are susceptible for overwhelming infection with 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, carrying a high mortality. Although Toll-like receptor 
(TLR)-2 is considered the major receptor for Gram-positive bacteria in innate
immunity, it does not play a major role in host defense against pneumococcal
pneumonia. We wanted to investigate if in absence of an intact spleen as a first 
line of defense, the role of TLR2 during pneumococcal pneumonia becomes more
significant, thereby explaining its insignificant role during infections in
immune competent hosts.
METHODS: We intranasally infected splenectomized wildtype (WT), TLR2 knock-out
(KO) and TLR2/4 double KO mice with either serotype 2 or 3 S. pneumoniae.
RESULTS: There were no differences between asplenic WT and TLR2KO mice of
bacterial loads in lung homogenates and blood, cytokine and chemokine levels in
the lungs, and lung pathology scores. TLR2/4 double KO mice were not impaired in 
bacterial control as well, which indicates that besides the interaction between
S. pneumoniae and TLR2, the interaction between pneumolysin and TLR4 does not
stimulate antibacterial defense in the asplenic host either.
CONCLUSIONS: These results argue against a significant role of TLR2 in host
defense during S. pneumoniae pneumonia in the asplenic state. Therefore, other
components can provide sufficient backup mechanisms for TLR2 deficiency in the
defense against intrapulmonary infections with S. pneumoniae of the otherwise
immune competent host.
