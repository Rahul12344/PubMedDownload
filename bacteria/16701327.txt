Without mitochondria we would be in big trouble, and there would be a global
biological energy crisis if it were not for chloroplasts. Fortunately, genomic
evolution over the past two billion years has ensured that the functions of these
key organelles are with us to stay. Whole-genome analyses have not only proven
that mitochondria and chloroplasts are descended from formerly free-living
bacteria, but have also shown that it is difficult to define eukaryotes without
reference to the fusion and coevolution of host and endosymbiont genomes. Here,
we review how the macro- and microevolutionary insights that follow from the
genomics of cytonuclear interactions are uniting molecular evolution, structural 
proteomics, population genetics and problems in aging and disease. Our goals are 
to clarify the coevolutionary events that have governed nuclear and organelle
evolution, and to encourage further critical analyses of these interactions as
problems in the study of co-adapted gene complexes.
