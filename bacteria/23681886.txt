Structural representative of the protein family PF14466 has a new fold and
establishes links with the C2 and PLAT domains from the widely distant Pfams
PF00168 and PF01477.

The domain of unknown function (DUF) YP_001302112.1, a protein secreted by the
human intestinal microbita, has been determined by NMR and represents the first
structure for the Pfam PF14466. Its NMR structure is classified as a new fold,
which, nonetheless, shows limited similarities with representatives of the
PLAT/LH2 domains from PF01477 and the C2 domains from PF00168, both of which bind
Ca(2+) for their physiological functions. Further experiments revealed affinity
of YP_001302112.1 for Ca(2+), and the NMR structure in the presence of CaCl2 was 
better defined than that of the apo-protein. Overall, these NMR structures
establish a new connection between structural representatives from two widely
different Pfams that include the calcium-binding domain of a sialidase from
Vibrio cholerae and the α-toxin from Clostridium perfrigens, whereby these two
proteins have only 7% sequence identity. Furthermore, it provides information
toward the functional annotation of YP_001302112.1, based on its capacity to bind
Ca(2+), and thus adds to the structural and functional coverage of the protein
sequence universe.
