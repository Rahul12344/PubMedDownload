Neurovascular, autoimmune, and traumatic injuries of the central nervous system
(CNS) all have in common an initial acute inflammatory response mediated by
influx across the blood-brain barrier of activated mononuclear cells followed by 
chronic and often progressive disability. Although some anti-inflammatory
therapies can reduce cellular infiltration into the initial lesions, there are
essentially no effective treatments for the progressive phase. We here review the
successful treatment of animal models for four separate neuroinflammatory and
neurodegenerative CNS conditions using a single partial MHC class II construct
called DRa1-hMOG-35-55 or its newest iteration, DRa1(L50Q)-hMOG-35-55 (DRhQ) that
can be administered without a need for class II tissue type matching due to the
conserved DRÎ±1 moiety of the drug. These constructs antagonize the cognate TCR
and bind with high affinity to their cell-bound CD74 receptor on macrophages and 
dendritic cells, thereby competitively inhibiting downstream signaling and
pro-inflammatory effects of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its 
homolog, D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT=MIF-2) that bind to identical residues of
CD74 leading to progressive disease. These effects suggest the existence of a
common pathogenic mechanism involving a chemokine-driven influx of activated
monocytes into the CNS tissue that can be reversed by parenteral injection of the
DRa1-MOG-35-55 constructs that also induce anti-inflammatory macrophages and
microglia within the CNS. Due to their ability to block this common pathway,
these novel drugs appear to be prime candidates for therapy of a wide range of
neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative CNS conditions.
