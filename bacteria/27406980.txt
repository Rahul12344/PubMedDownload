Targeted genome editing technology can correct the sickle cell disease mutation
of the β-globin gene in hematopoietic stem cells. This correction supports
production of red blood cells that synthesize normal hemoglobin proteins. Here,
we demonstrate that Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and 
the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9
nuclease system can target DNA sequences around the sickle-cell mutation in the
β-globin gene for site-specific cleavage and facilitate precise correction when a
homologous donor template is codelivered. Several pairs of TALENs and multiple
CRISPR guide RNAs were evaluated for both on-target and off-target cleavage
rates. Delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 components to CD34+ cells led to over 18% gene
modification in vitro. Additionally, we demonstrate the correction of the sickle 
cell disease mutation in bone marrow derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells from sickle cell disease patients, leading to the production of 
wild-type hemoglobin. These results demonstrate correction of the sickle mutation
in patient-derived CD34+ cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
