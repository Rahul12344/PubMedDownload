The antimicrobial peptide protegrin-1 (PG-1) inhibited the growth in vitro of
drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis; a lower
activity was shown by human beta-defensin-1 (HBD-1) against both strains. The
combination of PG-1 or HBD-1 with isoniazid significantly reduced M. tuberculosis
growth in comparison with the peptides or isoniazid alone.
