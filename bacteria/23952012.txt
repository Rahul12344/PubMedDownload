In superficial tinea and pityriasis versicolor, the causative fungi are for the
most part confined to the stratum corneum which is barely reached by leukocytes. 
Therefore, a role of non-cellular components in the epidermal antifungal defence 
was suggested. To investigate the presence of such factors in these infections,
the expression of human beta defensins 2 and 3 (hBD-2, hBD-3), RNase 7,
psoriasin, toll-like receptors 2, 4 and 9 (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9) and dectin 2 was 
analysed by use of immunostainings in skin biopsies. We found that hBD2, hBD3,
psoriasin, RNase7, TLR2 and TLR4 were significantly more often expressed in
distinct layers of lesional epidermis as compared with uninfected epidermis. In
both infections but not in normal skin, hBD2 and hBD3 were commonly expressed
within the stratum corneum and in the stratum granulosum. Similarly, psoriasin
was seen more often in the upper skin layers of both infections as compared with 
normal skin. No significant differences between normal and infected skin were
found for the expression of TLR9 and dectin 2. Our findings clearly show the
expression of specific antimicrobial proteins and defence-related ligands in
superficial tinea as well as in pityriasis versicolor, suggesting that these
factors contribute to fungal containment.
