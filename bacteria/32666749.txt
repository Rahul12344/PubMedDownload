BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) with
indocyanine green (ICG) is an adjuvant therapeutic approach in the treatment of
periodontitis. To explore whether PTT/PDT with ICG causes cell death by apoptosis
in human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells, BAX and BCL-2 genes expression as key
events for apoptosis were evaluated in this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HGF cells were treated with: 1) different concentrations
(500-2000 µg/mL) of ICG alone, 2) Diode laser irradiation alone with a fluency of
39.06 J/cm2; 3) PTT/PDT combined different concentrations (500-2000 µg/mL) of ICG
with an 808 nm diode laser with a fluency of 39.06 J/cm2, and 4) controls
(untreated cells). After that, BAX and BCL-2 messenger RNA levels were evaluated 
by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR.
RESULTS: PTT/PDT with 500 µg/mL of ICG caused significant increases in the
expression of the BAX gene, with an 8.5-fold increase, which was approximately 7-
and 8.5-fold higher than PTT/PDT with ICG for 1500 and 2000 µg/mL of ICG,
respectively, indicating induction of apoptosis in HGF cells. ICG (in different
test concentrations), diode laser, and PTT/PDT with ICG (1500 and 2000 µg/mL of
ICG) treatment displayed insignificant increases in expression levels of BAX (all
p>0.05). Our experiments showed an insignificant increase (1.1-1.6-fold) in the
expression of BCL-2 after ICG, diode laser, and PTT/PDT with ICG treatment (all
p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that various concentration of ICG can be the
diverse expression of BAX responses to PTT/PDT on HGF cells.
