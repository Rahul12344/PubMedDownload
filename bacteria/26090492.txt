The term "microbiota" means genetic inheritance associated with microbiota, which
is about 100 times larger than the guest. The tolerance of the resident bacterial
flora is an important key element of immune cell function. A key role in the
interaction between the host and the microbiota is played by Paneth cell, which
is able to synthesize and secrete proteins and antimicrobial peptides, such as
α/β defensins, cathelicidin, 14 β-glycosidases, C-type lectins, and ribonuclease,
in response to various stimuli. Recent studies found probiotics able to preserve 
intestinal homeostasis by downmodulating the immune response and inducing the
development of T regulatory cells. Specific probiotic strain, as well as
probiotic-driven metabolic products called "postbiotics," has been recently
recognized and it is able to influence innate immunity. New therapeutic
approaches based on probiotics are now available, and further treatments based on
postbiotics will come in the future.
