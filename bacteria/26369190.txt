Deposition Technique.

In this work, we found the characteristics of an antibacterial TiAgN thin film
coated on the pure titanium specimen via the physical vapor deposition process
(PVD). TiAgN thin films were coated using TiAg alloy targets by arc ion plating
method. Changing the process parameters, the surface analysis of TiAgN thin film 
was observed by FE-SEM and the force of adhesion was measured with Scratch
Tester. The proliferation of human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells was examined
by XTT test assay and the antibacterial properties were investigated by culturing
Streptococus Mutans (KCTC 3065) using paper disk techniques. At the result of
experiment, cytotoxic effects were not found and the antibacterial effects
against Streptococus Mutans were appeared over 5 wt% TiAgN specimens.
