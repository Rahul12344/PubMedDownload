Klebsiella pneumoniae-associated pathology is largely mediated by neutrophilic
inflammation. In this study, we administered Klebsiella pneumoniae to
experimental guinea pig groups and the ELR-CXC chemokine antagonist CXCL8(3-72), 
ceftazidime, and dexamethasone to different groups, respectively. After 24 h, we 
assessed the animal's pulmonary inflammatory levels, including gross
histopathology, airway neutrophilia, lung myeloperoxidase levels, expressions of 
CXCL8 and TNF, and airway bacterial loads. Compared with ceftazidime and
dexamethasone treatments, the administration of the ELR-CXC chemokine antagonist 
CXCL8(3-72) alone was more effective than other methods, although it did not
markedly attenuate the bacterial load. These results suggest new methods for the 
treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae pathology.
