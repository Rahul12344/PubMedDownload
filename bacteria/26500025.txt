In this study, we attempt to target both the urokinase plasminogen activator and 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell
lines and primary AML blasts using PrAgU2/LF, a urokinase-activated anthrax
lethal toxin. PrAgU2/LF was cytotoxic to five out of nine AML cell lines.
Cytotoxicity of PrAgU2/LF appeared to be nonapoptotic and was associated with
MAPK activation and urokinase activity because all the PrAgU2/LF-sensitive cell
lines showed both uPAR expression and high levels of MEK1/2 phosphorylation.
Inhibition of uPAR or desensitization of cells to MEK1/2 inhibition blocked
toxicity of PrAgU2/LF, indicating requirement for both uPAR expression and MAPK
activation for activity. PrAgU2/LF was also cytotoxic to primary blasts from AML 
patients, with blasts from four out of five patients showing a cytotoxic response
to PrAgU2/LF. Cytotoxicity of primary AML blasts was also dependent on uPAR
expression and phos-MEK1/2 levels. CD34(+) bone marrow blasts and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells lacked uPAR expression and were resistant to PrAgU2/LF,
demonstrating the lack of toxicity to normal hematological cells and, therefore, 
the tumor selectivity of this approach. Dose escalation in mice revealed that the
maximal tolerated dose of PrAgU2/LF is at least 5.7-fold higher than that of the 
wild-type anthrax lethal toxin, PrAg/LF, further demonstrating the increased
safety of this molecule. We have shown, in this study, that PrAgU2/LF is a novel,
dual-specific molecule for the selective targeting of AML.
