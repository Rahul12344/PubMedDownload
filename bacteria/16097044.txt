AIM: Human beta-defensin (HBD)-1 and HBD-2 are endogenous antimicrobial peptides.
Unlike HBD-1, the HBD-2 expression is augmented by Helicobacter pylori (H
pylori). We sought to determine HBD-1 and HBD-2 concentrations in gastric juice
during H pylori infection.
METHODS: HBD-1 and HBD-2 concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in
plasma and gastric juice of 49 H pylori-infected and 33 uninfected subjects and
before and after anti-H pylori treatment in 13 patients with H pylori-associated 
gastritis. Interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-8 concentrations in gastric juice were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Histological grades of
gastritis were determined using two biopsy specimens taken from the antrum and
corpus. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used
to identify HBD-2.
RESULTS: HBD-2 concentrations in gastric juice, but not in plasma, were
significantly higher in H pylori-positive than -negative subjects, albeit the
post-treatment levels were unchanged. Immunoreactivity for HBD-2 was exclusively 
identified in H pylori-infected mucosa by RP-HPLC. HBD-2 concentrations in
gastric juice correlated with histological degree of neutrophil and mononuclear
cell infiltration in the corpus. IL-1beta levels correlated with those of IL-8,
but not HBD-2. Plasma and gastric juice HBD-1 concentrations were similar in H
pylori-infected and uninfected subjects.
CONCLUSION: Our results place the beta-defensins, especially HBD-2, in the front 
line of innate immune defence. Moreover, HBD-2 may be involved in the
pathogenesis of H pylori-associated gastritis, possibly through its function as
immune and inflammatory mediator.
