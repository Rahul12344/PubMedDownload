Association between histocompatability antigens (HLA) and nasal carriage of
Staphylococcus aureus.

Kinsman OS, McKenna R, Noble WC.

We investigated the association between phenotypes of histocompatability antigen 
(HLA) and nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in two populations--healthy
laboratory workers and patients attending an outpatients' clinic. When data from 
the two sources were pooled, it was evident that the presence of HLA-DR3 was
associated with carriage, and the presence of HLA-DR2, HLA-DR1 and HLA-Bw35 with 
lack of carriage. However, since each person may have two antigenic specificities
encoded at the HLA-A, the HLA-B, and the HLA-DR loci, the carriage of the
organism was analysed for paired combinations of the more frequent phenotypes.
For example, the lack of carriage evident with HLA-DR1 was more marked with the
DR1-A11 and DR1-B7 combinations while the predisposition towards carriage shown
with HLA-DR3 was more marked with the DR3-DR5 combination. The importance of the 
analysis of antigen combinations is discussed in relation to association of
single antigens with carriage of S. aureus.
