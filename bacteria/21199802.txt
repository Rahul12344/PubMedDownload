Canonical Wnt signaling is deregulated in several types of human cancer where it 
plays a central role in tumor cell growth and progression. Here we report the
identification of 2 new small molecules that specifically inhibit canonical Wnt
pathway at the level of the destruction complex. Specificity was verified in
various cellular reporter systems, a Xenopus double-axis formation assay and a
gene expression profile analysis. In human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, the new
compounds JW67 and JW74 rapidly reduced active β-catenin with a subsequent
downregulation of Wnt target genes, including AXIN2, SP5, and NKD1. Notably,
AXIN2 protein levels were strongly increased after compound exposure. Long-term
treatment with JW74 inhibited the growth of tumor cells in both a mouse xenograft
model of CRC and in Apc(Min) mice (multiple intestinal neoplasia, Min). Our
findings rationalize further preclinical and clinical evaluation of these new
compounds as novel modalities for cancer treatment.
