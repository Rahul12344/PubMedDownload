Objective To investigate levels of regulatory B (Breg) cells, plasma cells, and
memory B cells in the peripheral blood, and interleukin (IL)-10 in the serum of
multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and to determine the correlation between Breg
cell levels and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Methods Levels
of Breg cells, plasma cells, and memory B cells in the peripheral blood of 12 MS 
patients were measured using flow cytometry. IL-10 serum levels were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The correlation between Breg cell levels and
MS EDSS score was measured using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results
Compared with healthy controls, MS patients had decreased levels of
CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg cells in their peripheral blood and reduced serum levels
of IL-10; however, the ratios of CD19+CD27hiCD38hi plasma cells and
CD19+CD27+CD24hi memory B cells to total B cells did not differ significantly
between healthy controls and MS patients. CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg cell levels in
the peripheral blood of MS patients were not significantly correlated with MS
EDSS score. Conclusion Peripheral blood CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Breg cell levels and
serum IL-10 levels were reduced in MS patients compared with controls, but Breg
cell levels were not correlated with MS EDSS score.
