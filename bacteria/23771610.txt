Infection is a major cause of the diabetic foot syndrome being aggravating by the
increased burden of multiresistant germs like methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Maximizing positive outcome for serious MRSA
infections requires an aggressive treatment approach and a careful monitoring of 
the healing process. Therefore, we examined 8 patients with MRSA-infected
diabetic foot syndrome Wagner classification grades 2 or 3 (corresponding to the 
Texas classification stage 2 and 3) during antibiotic treatment with daptomycin. 
We documented the wound size and obtained samples of wound secretion for analyses
of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6), protease (matrix metalloproteinase-9
[MMP-9]), and antiprotease activity (metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 [TIMP-1]).
During the course of anti-MRSA therapy, a decrease in the concentration of local 
IL-6 within the first 3 days followed by a drop of MMP-9 and an increase of
TIMP-1 was observed. Finally, a reduction of wound size could be documented. The 
present data show that efficient antimicrobial treatment with daptomycin leads to
a number of beneficial processes at the molecular level of wound healing in
MRSA-infected diabetic foot ulcers.
