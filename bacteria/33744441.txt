Antibiotic resistance represents one of the biggest public health challenges in
the last few years. Mur ligases (MurC-MurF) are involved in the synthesis of
UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide, the main building block of bacterial
peptidoglycan polymer. They are essential for the survival of bacteria and
therefore important antibacterial targets. We report herein the synthesis and
structure-activity relationships of Mur ligases inhibitors with an azastilbene
scaffold. Several compounds showed promising inhibitory potencies against
multiple ligases and one compound also possessed moderate antibacterial activity.
These results represent a solid ground for further development and optimization
of structurally novel antimicrobial agents to combat the rising bacterial
resistance.
