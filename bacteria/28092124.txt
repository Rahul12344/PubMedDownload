Xylan-degrading enzymes are crucial for the deconstruction of hemicellulosic
biomass, making the hydrolysis products available for various industrial
applications such as the production of biofuel. To determine the substrate
specificities of these enzymes, we prepared a collection of complex xylan
oligosaccharides by automated glycan assembly. Seven differentially protected
building blocks provided the basis for the modular assembly of 2-substituted,
3-substituted, and 2-/3-substituted arabino- and glucuronoxylan oligosaccharides.
Elongation of the xylan backbone relied on iterative additions of
C4-fluorenylmethoxylcarbonyl (Fmoc) protected xylose building blocks to a
linker-functionalized resin. Arabinofuranose and glucuronic acid residues have
been selectively attached to the backbone using fully orthogonal
2-(methyl)naphthyl (Nap) and 2-(azidomethyl)benzoyl (Azmb) protecting groups at
the C2 and C3 hydroxyls of the xylose building blocks. The arabinoxylan
oligosaccharides are excellent tools to map the active site of glycosyl
hydrolases involved in xylan deconstruction. The substrate specificities of
several xylanases and arabinofuranosidases were determined by analyzing the
digestion products after incubation of the oligosaccharides with glycosyl
hydrolases.
