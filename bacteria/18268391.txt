GM-CSF.

BACKGROUND: Eosinophils are multifunctional leukocytes. Under physiological
conditions, they circulate in the blood and through the tissues to serve their
functions. In certain inflammatory states, they enter the T-cell areas of lymph
nodes (LNs) that drain the inflamed tissue and communicate with T cells in LNs,
but the underlying mechanism that regulates their trafficking to LNs is not yet
fully explored. Here, we report that a human eosinophilic leukemia cell line,
EoL-1, and human peripheral blood (PB) eosinophils become reactive to the
lymphoid chemokines CCL21 and CCL25 upon stimulation.
METHODS: EoL-1 cells were differentiated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dEoL-1) and
subsequently pulsed with IFN-gamma, IL-3 and GM-CSF. The eosinophil fraction was 
purified from normal human adult PB and incubated for 1 day with the same
cytokine combination.
RESULTS: Upon cytokine stimulation, dEoL-1 cells expressed chemokine receptors
CCR7, CCR9 and CCR3 and developed chemotactic responsiveness to CCL21, CCL25 and 
CCL11, which bind to the respective receptors. Human PB eosinophils also showed
chemotactic responsiveness to CCL21 and CCL25 upon stimulation with IFN-gamma,
IL-3 and GM-CSF. In addition, the cytokine-stimulated dEoL-1 cells expressed
costimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR, and also
expressed a tolerogenic and Th2-polarizing enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.
CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro observations raise the possibility that eosinophils
may utilize lymphoid chemokines to enter LNs and serve antigen-presenting
functions in the LN under certain inflammatory conditions.
