Nitrogen ligands at the active site of alkaline phosphatase.

Taylor JS, Coleman JE.

The two Zn(II) ions of native Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) 
that are necessary for activity have been replaced by (63)Cu(II). Titration of
apoenzyme with up to 2 eq of Cu(II) gives a homogeneous species with an electron 
spin resonance typical for Cu(II) in an axially symmetric environment, with A(z) 
= 496 MHz, g(z) = g = 2.27, and g(x) = g(y) = 2.05. At least seven nitrogen
hyperfine lines, spaced 11 G apart, are clearly resolved on the M = +[unk] Cu(II)
hyperfine peak in the parallel region. When more than 2 eq of Cu(II) are added,
the electron spin resonance spectrum shows at least two types of Cu(II) binding
sites; the additional site, or sites, are characterized by lower g and higher
A(z) values. When Cu(II) is added to native Zn(II) alkaline phosphatase or to
apoenzyme incubated with 2 eq of Zn(II), the electron spin resonance spectrum
shows little or no trace of the species with higher g values and nitrogen
splitting. These results indicate that the species with higher g represents
copper bound at the site normally occupied by the 2 Zn (II) ions necessary for
enzyme activity, and that the metal ion at this site has at least 3 equivalent
nitrogen ligands, probably histidyl side chains.
