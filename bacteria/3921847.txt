Kujawa M, Macholz RM, Engst R.

Besides alterations of the DDT molecule by enzymatic reactions on its skeleton,
modifications of the phenylic rings were noted recently. Especially DDE which has
been considered very stable up to now is subject to an enzymatic hydroxylation
with forming some isomers. Furthermore, the isolation of methylsulfonyl
derivatives of DDE succeeded. Cleavages of the phenylic ring by microbial
influences and its metabolization are described too.
