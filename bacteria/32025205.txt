Fenofibrate (FF) protects against diabetic nephropathy (DN) in type 1 diabetic
(T1D) mice by upregulating the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21),
leading to the activation of the Akt-mediated Nrf2 antioxidant pathways. Here, we
examined which isoforms of Akt contribute to FF activation of FGF21-mediated
renal protection by examining the phosphorylation and expression of three
isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. T1D induced by a single intraperitoneal dose of
streptozotocin (STZ) resulted in reduced phosphorylation of one isoform, Akt2,
but FF treatment increased renal Akt2 phosphorylation in these and normal mice,
suggesting a potential and specific role for renal Akt2 in FF protection against 
T1D. This was further confirmed using in vitro cultured HK-2 human kidney tubule 
cells exposed to high glucose (HG) with siRNA silencing of the Akt2 gene and
STZ-induced diabetic Akt2-knockout mice with and without 3-month FF treatment. In
normal HK-2 cells exposed to HG for 24 hours, FF completely prevented cell death,
reduced total Akt expression and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β
phosphorylation, increased nuclear accumulation of Fyn, and reduced nuclear Nrf2 
levels. These positive effects of FF were partially abolished by silencing Akt2
expression. Similarly, FF abolished T1D-induced renal oxidative stress,
inflammation, and renal dysfunction in wild-type mice, but was only partially
effective in Akt2-KO mice. Furthermore, FF treatment stimulated phosphorylation
of AMPKα, an important lipid metabolism mediator, which in parallel with Akt2
plays an important role in FF protection against HG-induced HK-2 cells oxidative 
stress and damage. These results suggest that FF protects against DN through
FGF21 to activate both Akt2/GSK-3β/Fyn/Nrf2 antioxidants and the AMPK pathway.
Therefore, FF could be repurposed for the prevention of DN in T1D patients.
