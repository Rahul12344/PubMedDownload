Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to directly visualize the end-to-end
DNA interaction mediated by magnesium cations. We took advantage of the APS-mica,
allowing the preparation of samples in a broad range of monovalent and divalent
cations to separate the effects of Mg(2+) and Na(+) cations on the interaction of
restriction DNA fragments with cohesive end. The AFM data clearly show that DNA
restriction fragments with cohesive ends form substantial amount of circles in
the presence of Mg(2+) cations, suggesting that Mg(2+) cations stabilize the
interaction of cohesive ends. This effect depends on the MgCl(2) concentration,
so that the yield of circles approaches 18% in the presence of 50 mM MgCl(2).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this conferred cohesive end stability is
specific for divalent cations, as substitution of MgCl(2) with NaCl leads to a
near complete loss of cohesive end stability. We further demonstrate that
cohesive end stabilization is achieved by substituting Mg(2+) with Ca(2+),
Mn(2+), or Zn(2+). The data obtained suggest that the end stabilization mediated 
by divalent cations is primarily the result of inter-base interactions rather
than bridging of phosphate moieties.
