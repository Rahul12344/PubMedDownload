CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE8 (CDK8) is a widely studied component of eukaryotic
Mediator complexes. However, the biological and molecular functions of plant CDK8
are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence for regulatory functions of
Arabidopsis thaliana CDK8 in defense and demonstrate its functional and molecular
interactions with other Mediator and non-Mediator subunits. The cdk8 mutant
exhibits enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea but susceptibility to Alternaria
brassicicola. The contributions of CDK8 to the transcriptional activation of
defensin gene PDF1.2 and its interaction with MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT25 (MED25) 
implicate CDK8 in jasmonate-mediated defense. Moreover, CDK8 associates with the 
promoter of AGMATINE COUMAROYLTRANSFERASE to promote its transcription and
regulate the biosynthesis of the defense-active secondary metabolites
hydroxycinnamic acid amides. CDK8 also interacts with the transcription factor
WAX INDUCER1, implying its additional role in cuticle development. In addition,
overlapping functions of CDK8 with MED12 and MED13 and interactions between CDK8 
and C-type cyclins suggest the conserved configuration of the plant Mediator
kinase module. In summary, while CDK8's positive transcriptional regulation of
target genes and its phosphorylation activities underpin its defense functions,
the impaired defense responses in the mutant are masked by its altered cuticle,
resulting in specific resistance to B. cinerea.
