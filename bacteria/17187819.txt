Tetramers of major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC) are now
well-established reagents for the detection of antigen-specific T cells by flow
cytometry. MHC tetramers are prepared by mixing enzymatically biotinylated MHC
molecules with commercial preparations of streptavidin, usually conjugated to a
fluorescent phycobiliprotein such as phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC).
While data obtained with MHC tetramers prepared with small molecule fluorophores 
has been reported, considerable lot-to-lot variation among conventional
streptavidin conjugates to small molecules prevents routine preparation of such
reagents. We now report robust preparation of MHC tetramers with small molecule
fluorophores, using a recombinant mutant of streptavidin incorporating a
carboxy-terminal cysteine in each of the four identical subunits that is
conjugated to maleimide derivatives of any of several small molecule
fluorophores. These reagents significantly expand the versatility of the MHC
tetramer methodology.
