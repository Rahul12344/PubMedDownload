[Article in French]

Coulanges P, Randrianantoanina E.

Two plague transmitting malagasy fleas S. fonquerniei and X. cheopis, caugh in
the cities of Tananarive, Antsirabe-Betafo and Ampefy were tested in conformity
with WHO standards. These two fleas were resistant to DDT, dieldrin and
malathion, Moreover, X. cheopis from the cities of Tananarive and
Antsirabe-Betafo were resistant fenitrothion and propoxur. It seems to be first
description of simultaneous resistance to organochlorinated, organophosphorylated
and carbamylated products. The authors discuss the causes of this exceptional
phenomenon, and make some suggestions in order to obtain a better knowledge and
understanding of this phenomenon.
