FX is a homodimeric NADP(H)-binding protein of 68 kDa, first identified in human 
erythrocytes, from which it was purified to homogeneity. Its function has been
unrecognized despite partial structural and genetic characterization. Recently,
on the basis of partial amino acid sequence, it proved to be the human homolog of
the murine protein P35B, a tumor rejection antigen. In order to address the
biochemical role of FX, its primary structure was completed by cDNA sequencing.
This sequence revealed a significant homology with many proteins from different
organisms. Specifically, FX showed a remarkable similarity with a putative
Escherichia coli protein, named Yefb, whose gene maps in a region of E. coli
chromosome coding for enzymes involved in synthesis and utilization of
GDP-D-mannose. Accordingly, a possible role of FX in this metabolism was
investigated. The data obtained indicate FX as the enzyme responsible for the
last step of the major metabolic pathway resulting in GDP-L-fucose synthesis from
GDP-D-mannose in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. Specifically, purified FX
apparently catalyzes a combined epimerase and NADPH-dependent reductase reaction,
converting GDP-4-keto-6-D-deoxymannose to GDP-L-fucose. This is the substrate of 
several fucosyltranferases involved in the correct expression of many
glyconjugates, including blood groups and developmental antigens.
