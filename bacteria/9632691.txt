14-3-3 proteins bind a variety of molecules involved in signal transduction, cell
cycle regulation and apoptosis. 14-3-3 binds ligands such as Raf-1 kinase and Bad
by recognizing the phosphorylated consensus motif, RSXpSXP, but must bind
unphosphorylated ligands, such as glycoprotein Ib and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
exoenzyme S, via a different motif. Here we report the crystal structures of the 
zeta isoform of 14-3-3 in complex with two peptide ligands: a Raf-derived
phosphopeptide (pS-Raf-259, LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHMV) and an unphosphorylated peptide
derived from phage display (R18, PHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP) that inhibits binding of
exoenzyme S and Raf-1. The two peptides bind within a conserved amphipathic
groove on the surface of 14-3-3 at overlapping but distinct sites. The
phosphoserine of pS-Raf-259 engages a cluster of basic residues (Lys49, Arg56,
Arg60, and Arg127), whereas R18 binds via the amphipathic sequence, WLDLE, with
its two acidic groups coordinating the same basic cluster. 14-3-3 is dimeric, and
its two peptide-binding grooves are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, 30 A
apart. The ability of each groove to bind different peptide motifs suggests how
14-3-3 can act in signal transduction by inducing either homodimer or heterodimer
formation in its target proteins.
