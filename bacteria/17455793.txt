All 3-10-d-old Oscillatoria salina filaments glide with the speed of 323-330
microm/min (BG 11 medium, pH 7.5, 21 +/- 2 degrees C, continuous light intensity 
of approximately 30 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) in a culture chamber. However, a time
bound progressive decrease in gliding speed and in percentage of gliding
filaments occurred, depending upon the severity of different stress factors
studied, viz. water stress (2-8% agarized media, liquid media with 0.2-1 mol/L
NaCl, blot-dryness of filaments for > or = 5 min), temperature shock (5, 40
degrees C for > or = 5 min; 35 degrees C for > or = 15 min), darkness and low
light intensity (2, 10 micromol m(-2) s(-1)), UV exposure (0.96-3.84 kJ/m2), pH
extremes (< or = 6.5 and > or = 9.5), lack of all nutrients from liquid medium
(double distilled water), presence of 'heavy' metals (1, 25 ppm Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni,
Co, Hg) or organic substances in liquid medium (25, 250 ppm 2,4-D, captan, urea, 
DDT, thiourea). This feature of the alga (i.e. reduction in speed and percentage 
of gliding filaments depending upon severity of stress conditions) may thus be
suggested to be used in assessing water quality.
