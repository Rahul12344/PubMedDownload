Biofilms represent a cohesive matrix of microrganisms and other cellular
constituents that might be present in any natural environment. Microrganisms able
to produce biofilms undergo a number of distinctive and typical phenomenon, such 
as adhesiveness on infected cellular surfaces that consequently becomes
irreversible, so deeply changing the microrganisms physiological status. In
addition, biofilms play a central role in consenting microrganisms to survive and
subsequently to spread in the host, since exocellular matrix protects pathogen
bacteria from antibodies and immunocompetent cells devoted to their destruction, 
and from antimicrobial agents. So, use of antimicrobials able to penetrate
cellular membrane and to act into the cell has to be considered as essential in
the treatment of infections that may possibly involve biofilm-producer
microrganisms, considering their aggressive and virulent behaviour and their
intrinsic bacterial resistance.
