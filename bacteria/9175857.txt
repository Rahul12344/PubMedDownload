The helABC genes are predicted to encode an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter necessary for heme export for ligation in bacterial cytochrome c
biogenesis. The recent discoveries of homologs of the helB and helC genes in
plant mitochondrial genomes suggest this is a highly conserved transporter in
prokaryotes and some eukaryotes with the HelB and HelC proteins comprising the
transmembrane components. Molecular genetic analysis in the Gram-negative
bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus was used to show that the helABC and helDX genes
are part of an operon linked to the secDF genes. To facilitate analysis of this
transporter, strains with non-polar deletions in each gene, epitope and
reporter-tagged HelABCD proteins, and antisera specific to the HelA and HelX
proteins were generated. We directly demonstrate that this transporter is present
in the cytoplasmic membrane as an HelABCD complex. The HelB and HelC but not HelD
proteins are necessary for the binding and stability of the HelA protein, the
cytoplasmic subunit containing the ATP-binding region. In addition we show that
the HelA protein co-immunoprecipitates with either the HelC or HelD proteins.
Thus, the HelABCD heme export complex is distinguished by the presence of four
membrane-associated subunits and represents a unique subfamily of ABC
transporters.
