Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is initiated by the
deposition and accumulation of low-density lipoproteins in the artery wall. In
this review, we will discuss the role of T- and B-cells in human plaques at
different stages of atherosclerosis and the utility of profiling circulating
immune cells to monitor atherosclerosis progression. Evidence supports a
proatherogenic role for intraplaque T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, CD4+CD28null
T-cells, and natural killer T-cells, whereas Th2 cells and regulatory T-cells
(Treg) have an atheroprotective role. Several studies indicate that intraplaque
T-cells are activated upon recognition of endogenous antigens including heat
shock protein 60 and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, but antigens derived from 
pathogens can also trigger T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Future
studies are needed to assess whether circulating cellular biomarkers can improve 
identification of vulnerable lesions so that effective intervention can be
implemented before clinical manifestations are apparent.
