Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis that 
limits vessel density in normal tissues and curtails tumor growth. Here, we show 
that the inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and the induction of
apoptosis by thrombospondin-1 all required the sequential activation of CD36,
p59fyn, caspase-3 like proteases and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. We
also detected increased endothelial cell apoptosis in situ at the margins of
tumors in mice treated with thrombospondin-1. These results indicate that
thrombospondin-1, and possibly other broad-spectrum natural inhibitors of
angiogenesis, act in vivo by inducing receptor-mediated apoptosis in activated
microvascular endothelial cells.
