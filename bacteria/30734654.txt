A stabilized cartilage construct without signs of hypertrophy in chondrocytes is 
still a challenge. Suspensions of adipose stem/stromal cells (ASCs) and cartilage
progenitor cells (CPCs) were seeded into micromolded nonadhesive hydrogel to
produce spheroids (scaffold- and serum-free method) characterized by size,
immunohistochemistry, fusion, and biomechanical properties. After cell
dissociation, they were characterized for mesenchymal cell surface markers, cell 
viability, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both targeted
and nontargeted (shotgun mass spectrometry) analyses were conducted on the
culture supernatants. Induced ASC spheroids (ø = 350 μm) showed high cell
viability and CD73 downregulation contrasting to CD90. The transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β3/TGF-β1 ratio and SOX9 increased (p < 0.05), whereas interleukin
(IL)-6, IL-8, RUNX2, and ALPL decreased. Induced ASC spheroids were able to
completely fuse and showed a higher force required to compression at day 14
(p < 0.0001). Strong collagen type II in situ was associated with gradual
decrease of collagen type X and a lower COLXA1 gene expression at day 14 compared
with day 7 (p = 0.0352). The comparison of the secretome content of induced and
non-induced ASCs and CPCs identified 138 proteins directly relevant to
chondrogenesis of 704 proteins in total. Although collagen X was absent,
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), described as antiangiogenic and antihypertrophic, and
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a biomarker of chondrogenesis, were
upregulated in induced ASC spheroids. Our scaffold- and serum-free method mimics 
stable cartilage acting as a tool for biomarker discovery and for regenerative
medicine protocols. Impact Statement Promising adult stem cell sources for
cartilage regeneration include adipose stem/stromal cells (ASCs) from
subcutaneous adipose tissue. Our main objective was the development of a
reproducible and easy-to-handle scaffold- and serum-free method to obtain stable 
cartilage from induced ASC spheroids. In addition to targeted protein profiling
and biomechanical analysis, we provide the first characterization of the
secretome composition for ASC spheroids, providing a useful tool to monitor in
vitro chondrogenesis and a noninvasive quality control of tissue-engineered
constructs. Furthermore, our secretome analysis revealed a potential novel
biomarker-thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), known by its antiangiogenic properties and
recently described as an antihypertrophic protein.
