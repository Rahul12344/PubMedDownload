In 35 consecutively admitted children (mean age: 4.3 years) with a clinical
diagnosis of meningococcal septic shock (MSS), activation of the coagulation and 
fibrinolytic pathways was evaluated directly at admittance to the paediatric
intensive care unit (ICU). The association of clinical signs and haemostatic
abnormalities was assessed. All patients had signs of extensive activation of the
coagulation system. The 28-day mortality was 26%. Protein C activity was strongly
reduced, especially in non-survivors in whom it was significantly lower than in
survivors (5% versus 23%; p < 0.0001). There was a strong negative correlation
between protein C activity and the mean size of the skin lesions (r = -0.71, p < 
0.001). These results suggest that an acquired protein C deficiency in MSS is
related to the pathogenesis of purpura fulminans. Furthermore, no increase in
C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and no decrease in the ratio free protein S/total
protein S was observed, suggesting that a deficiency of free protein S as a
result of increased C4BP does not play a pathogenetic role in meningococcal
septic shock.
