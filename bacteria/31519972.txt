The higher prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among Escherichia coli
ST131 in Southeast Asia is driven by expansion of a single, locally prevalent
subclone.

The ST131 multilocus sequence type (MLST) of Escherichia coli is a globally
successful pathogen whose dissemination is increasing rates of antibiotic
resistance. Numerous global surveys have demonstrated the pervasiveness of this
clone; in some regions ST131 accounts for up to 30% of all E. coli isolates.
However, many regions are underrepresented in these published surveys, including 
Africa, South America, and Asia. We collected consecutive bloodstream E. coli
isolates from three countries in Southeast Asia; ST131 was the most common MLST
type. As in other studies, the C2/H30Rx clade accounted for the majority of ST131
strains. Clinical risk factors were similar to other reported studies. However,
we found that nearly all of the C2 strains in this study were closely related,
forming what we denote the SEA-C2 clone. The SEA-C2 clone is enriched for strains
from Asia, particularly Southeast Asia and Singapore. The SEA-C2 clone accounts
for all of the excess resistance and virulence of ST131 relative to non-ST131 E. 
coli. The SEA-C2 strains appear to be locally circulating and dominant in
Southeast Asia, despite the intuition that high international connectivity and
travel would enable frequent opportunities for other strains to establish
themselves.
