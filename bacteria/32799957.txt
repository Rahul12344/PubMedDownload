Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide,
particularly in rural areas. This study aimed at the identification of the
genotype/species belonging to Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) specimens
in retrieved percutaneously from the human host and to investigate their
relationship with cyst characteristics. The genetic identification of cyst
material was performed by mt-CO1 gene polymerase chain reaction, and confirmed
via sequencing. A total of 110 CE cysts were identified as E. granulosus s.l. In 
detail, 104 belonged to E. granulosus sensu stricto (G1 and G3) and six isolates 
were in the E. canadensis cluster (G6/7). All clusters were tested for the
relationship between demographics, cyst features and genetic diversity. The
relationship between genetic variation and certain clinical characteristics such 
as cyst volume and location were statistically significant for G6/7 cluster.
Further studies are required with a larger sample set to investigate the
relationship between the genetic variability of E. granulosus s.l. and cyst
features.
