Compounds with high lipophilic properties are often associated with bad
physicochemical properties, triggering many off-targets, and less likely to pass 
clinical trials. Two metabolically stable phenylthiazole antibiotic scaffolds
having notable high lipophilic characters, one with alkoxy side chain and the
other one with alkynyl moiety, were derivatized by inserting a cyclic amine at
the lipophilic tail with the objective of improving physicochemical properties
and the overall pharmacokinetic behavior. Only alkynyl derivatives with 4- or
5-membered rings showed remarkable antibacterial activity. The
azetidine-containing compound 8 was the most effective and it revealed a potent
antibacterial effect against 15 multi-drug resistant (MDR)-Gram positive
pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococci. Compound 8 was also highly effective 
in clearing 99.7% of the intracellular methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
harbored inside macrophages. In addition to the remarkable enhancement in aqueous
solubility, the in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats indicated that compound 8
can penetrate gut cells and reach plasma at a therapeutic concentration within
15 min and maintain effective plasma concentration for around 12 h.
Interestingly, the main potential metabolite (compound 9) was also active as an
antibacterial agent with potent antibiofilm activity.
