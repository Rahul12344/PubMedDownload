Cyanobacterial aldehyde decarbonylase (AD) catalyzes conversion of fatty
aldehydes (R-CHO) to alka(e)nes (R-H) and formate. Curiously, although this
reaction appears to be redox-neutral and formally hydrolytic, AD has a
ferritin-like protein architecture and a carboxylate-bridged dimetal cofactor
that are both structurally similar to those found in di-iron oxidases and
oxygenases. In addition, the in vitro activity of the AD from Nostoc punctiforme 
(Np) was shown to require a reducing system similar to the systems employed by
these O(2)-utilizing di-iron enzymes. Here, we resolve this conundrum by showing 
that aldehyde cleavage by the Np AD also requires dioxygen and results in
incorporation of (18)O from (18)O(2) into the formate product. AD thus
oxygenates, without oxidizing, its substrate. We posit that (i) O(2) adds to the 
reduced cofactor to generate a metal-bound peroxide nucleophile that attacks the 
substrate carbonyl and initiates a radical scission of the C1-C2 bond, and (ii)
the reducing system delivers two electrons during aldehyde cleavage, ensuring a
redox-neutral outcome, and two additional electrons to return an oxidized form of
the cofactor back to the reduced, O(2)-reactive form.
