CD28, a T cell costimulatory receptor, provides a signal that induces both
optimal proliferation and the production of IL-2 by TCR-activated T cells. We
show that the stimulation of CD28 leads to the activation of p21-activated kinase
and MEK kinase 1. The same pathway was also stimulated in T cells treated with
the cell-permeable ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide. The combined stimulation of
either CD3 and CD28 or CD3 concurrently with C2-ceramide largely enhanced the
activity of p21-activated kinase and MEK kinase 1. Therefore the
Rac1/CDC42-coupled pathway(s) is a candidate that transduces and facilitates
cross-talk between the CD28 costimulatory signal and the TCR signal.
