Peptide loading of class II MHC molecules in endosomal compartments is regulated 
by HLA-DM. HLA-DO modulates HLA-DM function, with consequences for the spectrum
of MHC-bound epitopes presented at the cell surface for interaction with T cells.
Here, we summarize and discuss recent progress in investigating the molecular
mechanisms of action of HLA-DM and HLA-DO and in understanding their roles in
immune responses. Key findings are the long-awaited structures of HLA-DM in
complex with its class II substrate and with HLA-DO, and observation of a novel
phenotype--autoimmunity combined with immunodeficiency--in mice lacking HLA-DO.
We also highlight several areas where gaps persist in our knowledge about this
pair of proteins and their molecular biology and immunobiology.
