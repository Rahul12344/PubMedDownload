BACKGROUND: Airborne bacteria are a major source for wound contamination during
total joint arthroplasty. Crystalline ultraviolet C (C-UVC) filter units were
designed to disinfect and recirculate air in the operating room (OR). This
preliminary study assessed the particle reducing capacity of C-UVC units in a
highly controlled OR setting.
METHODS: A particle counter was deployed in a positive-pressure OR to measure
total and viable particle counts (TPC/VPC). Thirty 23-minute experiments were
performed. At 4 designated times a person would walk through the door to mimic OR
traffic. Ten experiments were performed as controls, 10 experiments used a C-UVC 
unit 4 meters (m) from the door, and 10 cases with the C-UVC unit at 8 m.
Outcomes included overall, change (Δ), and maximum TPC/VPC. Mann-Whitney U-tests 
determined statistical differences in TPC/VPC.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, the cases with the C-UVC unit at 4 m had
significantly lower particle levels. Overall TPC/VPC, changes in TPC/VCP, and
maximum TPC/VPC were all significantly lower (P < .05) in the C-UVC unit (4 m)
group compared to the controls. The C-UVC at 8 m significantly reduced TPC in all
3 outcomes (P < .05) compared to controls; however, it did not significantly
reduce changes in VPC (P = .107) and maximum VPC (P = .052). There were no
significant differences in any outcomes between the 4 m and 8 m group.
CONCLUSION: C-UVC units have shown to be capable of significantly reducing TPC
and VPC in a highly controlled OR setting. Reducing airborne particles using
C-UVC units may reduce infection rates following total joint arthroplasty.
