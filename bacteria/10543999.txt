The effect of Bad overexpression on apoptosis was demonstrated by a mouse Bad
transgene stably expressed in NIH/3T3 cells. The cells overexpressing Bad treated
with either serum starvation or ceramide showed apoptotic characteristics evident
at 18 and 8 h, respectively. Whether serum deprivation and ceramide utilize a
common death pathway requires further investigation. The time for the first
apoptosis detection was shortened to 2 h and was prominent at 4 h, while above
that time cells were maintained under serum-depleted conditions in the presence
of ceramide (40 microM). Further investigation revealed that the activity of
caspase-3 (CPP32) was elevated after ceramide treatment in Bad-transfected cells 
compared to that of the cells without Bad transfection, indicating the
involvement of caspase cascade. Furthermore, the Bad-transfected cells showed
reduced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Taken
together, we hypothesize that Bad-overexpressing NIH/3T3 cells in the presence of
ceramide undergo apoptosis by activating caspase cascade. Simultaneously, the
cell survival pathway was blocked possibly by inactivation of the MAPK pathway
such as the down-regulation of ERK.
