Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are essential transformations in natural
product biosynthesis. During de novo fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis,
β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases (KS), catalyze this process via a
decarboxylative Claisen-like condensation reaction. KSs must recognize multiple
chemically distinct ACPs and choreograph a ping-pong mechanism, often in an
iterative fashion. Here, we report crystal structures of substrate mimetic
bearing ACPs in complex with the elongating KSs from Escherichia coli, FabF and
FabB, in order to better understand the stereochemical features governing
substrate discrimination by KSs. Complemented by molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and mutagenesis studies, these structures reveal conformational
states accessed during KS catalysis. These data taken together support a gating
mechanism that regulates acyl-ACP binding and substrate delivery to the KS active
site. Two active site loops undergo large conformational excursions during this
dynamic gating mechanism and are likely evolutionarily conserved features in
elongating KSs.
