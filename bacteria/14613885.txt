The methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha is a recognised model system for
investigation of peroxisomal function, special metabolic pathways like methanol
metabolism, of nitrate assimilation or thermostability. Strain RB11, an odc1
derivative of the particular H. polymorpha isolate CBS4732 (synonymous to
ATCC34438, NRRL-Y-5445, CCY38-22-2) has been developed as a platform for
heterologous gene expression. The scientific and industrial significance of this 
organism is now being met by the characterisation of its entire genome. The H.
polymorpha RB11 genome consists of approximately 9.5 Mb and is organised as six
chromosomes ranging in size from 0.9 to 2.2 Mb. Over 90% of the genome was
sequenced with concomitant high accuracy and assembled into 48 contigs organised 
on eight scaffolds (supercontigs). After manual annotation 4767 out of 5933 open 
reading frames (ORFs) with significant homologies to a non-redundant protein
database were predicted. The remaining 1166 ORFs showed no significant similarity
to known proteins. The number of ORFs is comparable to that of other sequenced
budding yeasts of similar genome size.
