Activity of amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Ximenes J, Bassoi ON, de Menezes JP, Fry W.

The activity of amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin was tested in vitro against
clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Concentrations of the antibiotics in
serum and in saline solution were prepared according to serum levels produced in 
volunteers 15 minutes, 1,2, and 6 hours after a single intramuscular injection of
500 mg amikacin, 80 mg gentamicin and 500 mg kanamycin. Following isolation of
the Pseudomonas strains in cultures, they were incubated and seeded in
Mueller-Hinton broth, then 10(-7) dilutions of the organisms were kept in contact
with the prepared antibiotic solutions in serum and in saline solution for three 
hours, the approximate half-life of the antibiotics in serum. Amikacin was active
at concentrations seen six hours post-dose, inhibiting growth in a total of 72-5%
of seeded plates. Gentamicin was active for only two hours and inhibited growth
in 2-5% of the plates. Kanamycin showed no antipseudomonal activity.
