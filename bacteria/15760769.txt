Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted inflammatory disorder, caused by the
spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Recent discoveries cast new light on Bb
dissemination and the ensuing pathogenesis of inflammation. Although the strong
proinflammatory Bb lipoproteins have been implicated in the induction of
inflammation, they do not seem to act exclusively through Toll-like receptor
(TLR) engagement. In fact, mice that are deficient for MyD88, a component of the 
TLR signaling pathway, manifest similar or increased recruitment of cells into
Bb-infected tissues. By contrast, the absence of the chemokine receptor CXCR2
results in reduced inflammation. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity
of Lyme disease pathogenesis and identify chemokine pathways as novel therapeutic
targets for the control of Bb-induced inflammation.
