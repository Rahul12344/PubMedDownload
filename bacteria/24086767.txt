We have examined the antimicrobial activity of C-terminal analogs of human
β-defensins HBD-1 and-3 wherein lysines have been selectively replaced by L- and 
D-arginines and L-isoleucine substituted with its D-enantiomer. The analogs
exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activities. Physiological concentration of
NaCl did not attenuate the activity of the peptides against Gram-negative
bacteria considerably, while some attenuation of activity was observed against S.
aureus. Variable attenuation of activity was observed in the presence of Ca²⁺ and
Mg²⁺. Introduction of D-amino acids abrogated the need for a disulfide bridge for
exhibiting activity. Confocal images of carboxyfluorescein (CF) labeled peptides 
indicated initial localization on the membrane and subsequent translocation into 
the cell. Analogs corresponding to cationic rich segments of human defensins
substituted with L- and D-arginine, could be attractive candidates for
development as future therapeutic drugs.
