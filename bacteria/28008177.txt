Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) feature a malignant clone containing the JAK2
V617F mutation, or another mutation causing dysregulated JAK2 kinase activity.
The multiple disease phenotypes of MPNs, and their tendency to transform
phenotypically, suggest pathophysiologic heterogeneities beyond a common
phenomenon of JAK2 hyperactivation. JAK2 has the potential to activate multiple
other signaling molecules, either directly through downstream effectors, or
indirectly through induction of target gene expression. We have interrogated
myeloproliferative signaling in myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid
leukemia (sAML) patient samples using mass cytometry, which allows the
quantitative measurement of multiple signaling molecules simultaneously at the
single-cell level, in cell populations representing a nearly complete spectrum of
hematopoiesis. MF and sAML malignant cells demonstrated a high prevalence of
hyperactivation of the JAK-STAT, MAP kinase, PI3 kinase and NFκB signaling
pathways. Constitutive NFκB signaling was evident across MF and sAML patients. A 
supporting gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of MF showed many NFκB target
genes to be expressed above normal levels in MF patient CD34+ cells. NFκB
inhibition suppressed colony formation from MF CD34+ cells. This study indicates 
that NFκB signaling contributes to human myeloproliferative disease and is
abnormally activated in MF and sAML.
