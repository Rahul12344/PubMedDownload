Bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis is a rare condition, with only 14 cases
reported in the English literature. It carries a bad prognosis, surgical
management being the recommended mode of therapy. We report a case of bilateral
emphysematous pyelonephritis in a 50-year-old diabetic lady which was
successfully managed using antibiotics alone.
