The occurrence rate of HLA class I and class II alleles was established in 24
patients suffering from dermatological disorders associated with the Helicobacter
pylori infection. The increased frequency of HLA-C*0602, 4 was found to be 0.1875
compared to 0.0733 in the control group (odds ratio: 2.913; two-sided P value: P 
= 0.0251). Our data suggest that the HLA-Cw6 molecule play a role in the
susceptibility to the Helicobacter pylori infection.
