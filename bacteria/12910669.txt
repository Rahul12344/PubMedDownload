OBJECTIVE: Several evidences suggested that transgenic plants would be a facile
and economic bioreactor for large-scale production of industrial and
pharmaceutical recombinant proteins. This study is made in an attempt to
establish plant bioreactor for expression of recombinant hBD-2.
METHODS: Recombinant hBD-2 gene with C terminal of bi-tags of myc and 6xHis was
inserted into a plant expressive vector-pCAMBIA1304, which closely located the
down-stream of CaMV35S promoter. Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 was
transformed with the recombinant plant expressive vector: rpCAMBIA1304/hBD-2/His.
The positive clones of LBA4404 transformed by rpCAMBIA1304/hBD-2/His were
selected on a culture plate containing kanamycin. The callus tissues were
transfected by positive clones of LBA4404, and positive callus were examined by
using the resistant selection of hygromycin gene.
RESULTS: The evidences of enzyme digestion, PCR and sequence analysis confirmed
that recombinant hBD-2 gene with C terminal of bi-tags of myc and 6xHis was
correctly inserted into pCAMBIA1304 and was located between CaMV35S promoter and 
Nos terminal cordon to construct recombinant plant expressive vector:
rpCAMBIA1304/hBD-2/His, thus indicating that rpCAMBIA1304/hBD-2/His has
successfully transformed Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 and positive clones
have been isolated. The results from resistant selection of hygromycin gene
showed that rpCAMBIA1304/hBD-2/His has been transferred into the callus of wheat,
and the differentiation of callus tissue under selective pressure of hygromycin
is carried out continually.
CONCLUSION: The above data suggest that the technique of transgenic plant is
workable for the production of recombinant hBD-2.
