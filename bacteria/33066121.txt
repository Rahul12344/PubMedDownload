Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ligand and its receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) are important regulators of
cellular processes such as proliferation, motility, angiogenesis, and tissue
regeneration. In healthy adult somatic cells, this ligand and receptor pair is
expressed at low levels and has little activity except when tissue injuries
arise. In cancer cells, HGF/MET are often overexpressed, and this overexpression 
is found to correlate with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poorer overall
prognosis. This review focuses on the signaling of these molecules in the context
of malignant brain tumors. RTK signaling pathways are among the most common and
universally dysregulated pathways in gliomas. We focus on the role of HGF/MET in 
the following primary malignant brain tumors: astrocytomas, glioblastomas,
oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and embryonal central nervous system tumors
(including medulloblastomas and others). Brain metastasis, as well as current
advances in targeted therapies, are also discussed.
