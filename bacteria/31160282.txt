In a previous study, mutants with enhanced ciprofloxacin resistance (Cipr) were
selected from Escherichia coli J53/pMG252 carrying qnrA1 Strain J53 Cipr 8-2
showed an increase in the copy number and transcription level of qnrA1 We
sequenced the plasmids on Illumina and MinION platforms. Parental plasmid pMG252 
and plasmid pMG252A from strain J53 Cipr 8-2 were almost identical, except for
the region containing qnrA1 that in pMG252A contained 4 additional copies of the 
qnrA1-qacEΔ1-sul1-ISCR1 region.
