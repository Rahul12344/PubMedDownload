Many bacterial pathogens translocate effector proteins into host cells to
manipulate host cell functions. Here, we used a protein microarray comprising
virtually all human SRC homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domains to
comprehensively and quantitatively assess interactions between host cell proteins
and the early phase Chlamydia trachomatis effector protein translocated
actin-recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp), which is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated 
upon host cell entry. We discovered numerous novel interactions between human SH2
domains and phosphopeptides derived from Tarp. The adaptor protein SHC1 was among
Tarp's strongest interaction partners. Transcriptome analysis of SHC1-dependent
gene regulation during infection indicated that SHC1 regulates apoptosis- and
growth-related genes. SHC1 knockdown sensitized infected host cells to tumor
necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our findings reveal a critical
role for SHC1 in early C. trachomatis-induced cell survival and suggest that Tarp
functions as a multivalent phosphorylation-dependent signaling hub that is
important during the early phase of chlamydial infection.
