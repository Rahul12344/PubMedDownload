A highly sensitive and selective optical sensing system for antimonite has been
developed using genetically engineered bacteria. The basis of this system is the 
ability of certain bacteria to survive in environments that are contaminated with
antimonite, arsenite, and arsenate. The survival is conferred to the bacteria by 
the ars operon, which consists of five genes that code for three structural
proteins, ArsA, ArsB, and ArsC, and two regulatory proteins, ArsD and ArsR. ArsA,
ArsB, and ArsC form a protein pump system that extrudes antimonite, arsenite, and
arsenate once these anions reach the cytoplasm of the bacterium. A method was
developed for monitoring antimonite and arsenite by using a single plasmid that
incorporates the regulatory gene of the extrusion system, arsR, and the genes of 
bacterial luciferase, luxA and luxB. In the designed plasmid, ArsR regulates the 
expression of bacterial luciferase in a manner that is dependent on the
concentration of antimonite and arsenite in the sample. Thus, the bioluminescence
emitted by luciferase can be related to the concentration of antimonite and
arsenite in the sample. Concentrations for antimonite and arsenite in the order
of 10(-5) M, which corresponds to subattomole levels, can be detected. This
bacterial-based sensing system is highly selective for antimonite and arsenite.
