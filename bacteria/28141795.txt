Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein has an important role in
antiviral immunity and autoimmunity. However, the pathophysiological role of this
signaling pathway, especially in the brain, remains elusive. Here we demonstrated
that MAVS signaling existed and mediated poly(I:C)-induced inflammation in the
brain. Along with the MAVS signaling activation, there was an induction of
autophagic activation. Autophagy negatively regulated the activity of MAVS
through direct binding of LC3 to the LIR motif Y(9)xxI(12) of MAVS. We also found
that c-Abl kinase phosphorylated MAVS and regulated its interaction with LC3.
Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAVS was required for downstream
signaling activation. Importantly, in vivo data showed that the deficiency of
MAVS or c-Abl prevented MPTP-induced microglial activation and dopaminergic
neuron loss. Together, our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying
the regulation of MAVS-dependent microglial activation in the nervous system,
thus providing a potential target for the treatment of microglia-driven
inflammatory brain diseases.
