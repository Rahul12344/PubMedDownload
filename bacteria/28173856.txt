BACKGROUND: We have previously described the association between rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) prevalence and the two mutY Homolog (E. coli) (MUTYH) SNPs
(rs3219463 and rs3219476) among the Taiwanese population. This present study will
aim to elucidate whether the SNPs can alter the expression of EGFR in the
progression of RA.
METHODS: The cohort study included 368 Taiwan's Han Chinese RA patients and 364
healthy controls. Blood samples collected from the participants were analyzed to 
determine their serum MUTYH levels and to identify rs3219463 SNP of MUTYH from
their genomic DNA.
RESULTS: Our data resulted in a statistically significant difference in genotype 
frequency distributions at rs3219463 for RA patients and controls (p < 0.0002).
Also, the patients with G carrier at rs3219463 were less likely to suffer from
painful joints (p < 0.006) and DAS28 scores (p < 0.003). Furthermore, the
increase in serum level of MUTYH was also observed in RA patients (p < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that RA is associated with rs3219463 SNP in EGFR
gene and an increased serum level of the MUTYH protein. These findings suggest
MUTYH is worthy of further investigation as a therapeutic target for RA.
