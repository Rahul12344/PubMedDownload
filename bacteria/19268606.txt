The activation and expansion of na√Øve T cells require costimulatory signals
provided by CD28 and TNF family members. In contrast, for many years it was
believed that memory T cells do not require CD28 costimulation for expansion
during secondary responses. This was based on in vitro experiments that suggested
the re-activation of memory T cells is somewhat independent of costimulation.
Recent in vivo evidence, however, has challenged this and shown that both CD4+
and CD8+ memory T cells require CD28 costimulation for maximal expansion and
pathogen clearance. This requirement has important implications for host
immunity, vaccine development and immunotherapeutics.
