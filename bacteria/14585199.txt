T helper type 1 (Th1) cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) have been
closely associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Monokine-induced by IFN-gamma
(MIG), IFN-gamma-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), and
IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), are chemokines that bind CXCR3 and
mediate the chemotaxis of leukocytes. IP-10, MIG, and CXCR3 have been shown to be
expressed at sites of CD. The current study stems from our recent findings that
IP-10, MIG, and I-TAC significantly contribute to the development of Th1-mediated
inflammatory responses. To better understand the role of CXCR3 interactions
during CD, we characterized the effects of IP-10, MIG, I-TAC, and CXCR3+ T cells 
on mucosal immune responses. IP-10, MIG, and I-TAC significantly enhanced
antigen-specific serum and mucosal antibodies through Th1-mediated events and
CD28 modulation. Additionally, the adoptive transfer of naive CXCR3+ T cells and 
CD4+CD45RB(HI) to T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) x delta(-/-) mice resulted in
the onset of murine colitis. Taken together, these studies suggest that IP-10,
MIG, I-TAC, and CXCR3 interactions are involved in mucosal immune responses
required for the induction of CD.
