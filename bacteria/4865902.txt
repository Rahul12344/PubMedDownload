Bacteriological survey of the frozen prepared foods industry. IV. Frozen breaded 
fish.

Surkiewicz BF, Groomes RJ, Shelton LR Jr.

During sanitation-inspections of 23 breaded-fish processors, 573 finished product
units and 604 line samples were collected and analyzed bacteriologically. Data
for finished product units processed on the same data are presented in groups;
most of the groups consisted of 10 units. Groups of frozen, raw-breaded fish
produced under good and poor conditions of sanitation were studied. No more than 
20% of the units in each group produced under good conditions of sanitation were 
positive for Escherichia coli or coagulase-positive staphylococci. Groups of
frozen, fried-breaded fish produced under good and poor sanitary conditions were 
also studied. No more than 10% of the units in each good-sanitation group were
positive for E. coli or coagulase-positive staphylococci. However, approximately 
30% of the groups processed under poor sanitary conditions also did not exceed
these viable bacterial counts because of the lethal effect of the terminal fry to
which the product is subjected. It was found that line samples collected from the
processing lines reflected the sanitary conditions of the plant and provided
bacteriological support for inspectional evidence of plant insanitation.
