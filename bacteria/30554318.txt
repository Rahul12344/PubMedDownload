Organic matter (OM), a complex entity with diverse functional groups and
molecular sizes, has important effects on aquatic systems. We studied the optical
compositions and sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate
organic matter (POM) in Lake Taihu, a large, shallow and eutrophic lake in China.
Significant differences in optical compositions and sources occurred between the 
POM and DOM. The temporal-spatial distribution of the fluorescence indices
suggested that the POM in Lake Taihu was mainly from autochthonous sources, but
more exogenous characteristics were shown in POM in the river mouths compared
with other regions. The chromophoric DOM in Lake Taihu mainly displayed
autochthonous characteristics. The POM-DOM PARAFAC model was used to examine OM
optical composition and five components were identified, which contained three
protein-like components (C1, C2, and C5), a microbial humic-like component (C3), 
and a terrestrial humic-like component (C4). The POM was dominated by C5 in
summer and autumn and C3 in winter and spring, and the DOM was dominated by
protein-like components (C1, C2, and C5) through the entire year. The
algae-dominated region had a relative higher contribution of tryptophan-like
components of POM compared with the macrophyte-dominated region. A conceptual
model based on the theory of "four phases of cyanobacteria bloom development" was
proposed to fully describe the relationship between POM-DOM exchanges and
cyanobacteria bloom development.
