BACKGROUND & AIMS: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the most abundant microbial
metabolites in the intestine, activate cells via G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPRs), such as GPR41 and GPR43. We studied regulation of the immune response by 
SCFAs and their receptors in the intestines of mice.
METHODS: Inflammatory responses were induced in GPR41(-/-), GPR43(-/-), and
C57BL6 (control) mice by administration of ethanol; 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene
sulfonic-acid (TNBS); or infection with Citrobacter rodentium. We examined the
effects of C rodentium infection on control mice fed SCFAs and/or given
injections of antibodies that delay the immune response. We also studied the
kinetics of cytokine and chemokine production, leukocyte recruitment, intestinal 
permeability, and T-cell responses. Primary colon epithelial cells were isolated 
from GPR41(-/-), GPR43(-/-), and control mice; signaling pathways regulated by
SCFAs were identified using immunohistochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay, and flow cytometry analyses.
RESULTS: GPR41(-/-) and GPR43(-/-) mice had reduced inflammatory responses after 
administration of ethanol or TNBS compared with control mice, and had a slower
immune response against C rodentium infection, clearing the bacteria more slowly.
SCFAs activated intestinal epithelial cells to produce chemokines and cytokines
in culture and mice after administration of ethanol, TNBS, or C rodentium. These 
processes required GPR41 and GPR43 and were required to recruit leukocytes and
activate effector T cells in the intestine. GPR41 and GPR43 activated
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase signaling pathways in epithelial cells to induce production of chemokines 
and cytokines during immune responses.
CONCLUSIONS: SCFAs activate GPR41 and GPR43 on intestinal epithelial cells,
leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and rapid production of
chemokines and cytokines. These pathways mediate protective immunity and tissue
inflammation in mice.
