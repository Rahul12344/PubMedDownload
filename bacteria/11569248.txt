The immune status and profile of HLA antigens of loci A and B were evaluated in
159 patients with reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis was caused by urogenital
chlamydial infection in 64.2% of cases and by Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia
enterocolitica infection in 18.9% of cases. In patients with different etiology
of the disease some variations in its course and outcome, immune status as well
as in the HLA antigen profile were established that is indicative of genetic
determination of the immune response character. The established specific
variations in the immune and immunogenetic status of patients with reactive
arthritis of different etiology may be used for improving diagnosis and treatment
efficacy.
