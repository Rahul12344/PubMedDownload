BACKGROUND: Potential of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulating signaling
pathways related to cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) to predict gastric cancer 
development has not been fully investigated.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study consisting of 238 gastric
cancer cases and 238 matched controls within the Korean Multicenter Cancer
Cohort. Plasma HGF concentrations were measured with a human HGF ELISA. Odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for gastric cancer development
according to HGF level were calculated using conditional logistic regression
model.
RESULTS: Sequential elevation of gastric cancer risk according to HGF level
increase was observed (OR, 10.99; 95% CI, 4.91-24.62) for highest quartile HGF
(≥364 pg/mL) versus lowest quartile HGF (<167 pg/mL). A significantly increased
gastric cancer risk associated with high HGF level measured even 6 or more years 
prior to cancer diagnosis was also found. The group with both high risk of HGF
and CagA-related genetic variants was associated with highest gastric cancer risk
compared with the group with both low risk of HGF and genetic variants (P
interaction = 0.05). Model performance using HGF and CagA-related genetic
variants to discriminate gastric cancer was fair [area under the curve of
receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64-0.78] and
significantly higher than that of model not including those biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest HGF as a potential biomarker to predict gastric 
cancer development.
IMPACT: These findings suggest HGF as a useful biomarker to predict gastric
cancer risk. Further research to assess gastric cancer risk based on useful
biomarkers, including HGF, may contribute to primary prevention of gastric
cancer.
