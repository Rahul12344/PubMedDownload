Peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2) protein is an important member in cellular antioxidant
protein superfamily. Prx2 exists widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it not
only plays a part in eliminate reactive oxygen, but also takes effect in many
other metabolic activities, such as stimulate epithelial cell proliferation,
participate in the signal transduction in cells and so on. After molecular
cloning we got that the complete cDNA sequence of Prx2 consists 882 bp, including
a 5'-UTR of 46 bp, an open reading frame (ORF) of 591 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 245 bp.
The complete gene of miiuy croaker Prx2 has 5 exons and 4 introns. The deduced
197 amino acid residues of miiuy croaker Prx2 consists a Val-Cys-Pro (VCP)
motifs. In order to better elucidate the immune mechanisms of the Prx2 in the
lower vertebrates, we conducted a research about the Prx2 gene of miiuy croaker
and its expression pattern after bacterial infection. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR)
results showed that expression of Prx2 was up-regulated in kidney, liver and
spleen under infection with Vibrio anguillarum, and expressed level differently
in ten different uninjected tissues. Our results suggested that Prx2 might be
involved in immune defence in miiuy croaker.
