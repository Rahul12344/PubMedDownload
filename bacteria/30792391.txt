Our understanding of the conformational and electrostatic determinants that
underlie targeting of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) by anti-HLA alloantibodies
is principally based upon in silico modelling. Here we provide a
biochemical/biophysical and functional characterization of a human monoclonal
alloantibody specific for a common HLA type, HLA-A*11:01. We present a 2.4 Å
resolution map of the binding interface of this antibody on HLA-A*11:01 and
compare the structural determinants with those utilized by T-cell receptor (TCR),
killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and CD8 on the same molecule.
These data provide a mechanistic insight into the paratope-epitope relationship
between an alloantibody and its target HLA molecule in a biological context where
other immune receptors are concomitantly engaged. This has important implications
for our interpretation of serologic binding patterns of anti-HLA antibodies in
sensitized individuals and thus, for the biology of human alloresponses.
