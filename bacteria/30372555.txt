Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated system (Cas9)-mediated gene editing of human
hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs) is a promising strategy for the treatment of
genetic blood diseases through site-specific correction of identified causal
mutations. However, clinical translation is hindered by low ratio of precise gene
modification using the corrective donor template (homology-directed repair, HDR) 
to gene disruption (nonhomologous end joining, NHEJ) in hHSCs. By using a
modified version of Cas9 with reduced nuclease activity in G1 phase of cell cycle
when HDR cannot occur, and transiently increasing the proportion of cells in
HDR-preferred phases (S/G2), we achieved a four-fold improvement in HDR/NHEJ
ratio over the control condition in vitro, and a significant improvement after
xenotransplantation of edited hHSCs into immunodeficient mice. This strategy for 
improving gene editing outcomes in hHSCs has important implications for the field
of gene therapy, and can be applied to diseases where increased HDR/NHEJ ratio is
critical for therapeutic success. Stem Cells 2019;37:284-294.
