Current theories of CF pathogenesis predict different predisposing "local
environmental" conditions and sites of bacterial infection within CF airways.
Here we show that, in CF patients with established lung disease, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa was located within hypoxic mucopurulent masses in airway lumens. In
vitro studies revealed that CF-specific increases in epithelial O(2) consumption,
linked to increased airway surface liquid (ASL) volume absorption and mucus
stasis, generated steep hypoxic gradients within thickened mucus on CF epithelial
surfaces prior to infection. Motile P. aeruginosa deposited on CF airway surfaces
penetrated into hypoxic mucus zones and responded to this environment with
increased alginate production. With P. aeruginosa growth in oxygen restricted
environments, local hypoxia was exacerbated and frank anaerobiosis, as detected
in vivo, resulted. These studies indicate that novel therapies for CF include
removal of hypoxic mucus plaques and antibiotics effective against P. aeruginosa 
adapted to anaerobic environments.
