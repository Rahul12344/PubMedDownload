AIM: To investigate the pathogenesis of biliary casts after liver transplantation
relative to their morphology and biochemical markers.
METHODS: The microstructure of biliary casts was assessed using scanning electron
microscopy and Hematoxylin and eosin staining assessed their histology. The
expression levels of CD3, CD5, CD34, CD68 and CD79a in these biliary casts were
evaluated immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: Biliary casts differed widely in their microstructure, with some
containing blood vessels positive for CD34 and collagen fibers with positive
Masson staining. Large numbers of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells were
present, but only on the edge of the biliary casts; although the boundaries were 
clear without crossover. None of the biliary casts contained T-lymphocytes,
B-lymphocytes, macrophages and other inflammatory cells.
CONCLUSION: The microcostructure of biliary casts differed. Bacteria and acute
rejection are not clearly related to their formation.
