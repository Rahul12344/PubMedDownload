We sought to determine whether HLA-A and -B type and haplotype frequencies differ
between subgroups of adults with IgG subclass deficiency (IgGSD). We
retrospectively compared type and haplotype frequencies of three subgroups of 269
unrelated adult IgGSD patients (70 subnormal IgG1; 121 subnormal IgG3; 78
subnormal IgG1/IgG3) and controls (1,321 for types; 751 for haplotypes). We
selected types and haplotypes because their uncorrected frequencies differed
significantly from controls in a previous adult IgGSD/common variable
immunodeficiency cohort: A*24; B*14; B*35; B*40; B*49; B*50; B*58; B*62;
A*01,B*08; A*02,B*44; A*02,B*60; A*03,B*07; A*03,B*14; A*03,B*44; A*31,B*40; and 
A*32,B*14. We used χ2 analysis (2 × 4 tables) to identify frequency differences
across three subgroups and controls. If the null hypothesis was rejected
(p < 0.05), we computed 2 × 2 χ2 tables to compare six combinations of subgroup
and control frequencies [Bonferroni p < 0.0083 (< 0.05/6)]. Mean age was 48 ± 13 
years; 82.2% were women. B*35 and B*40 frequencies were higher in subnormal IgG1 
than subnormal IgG3 patients (0.1000 vs. 0.0248 and 0.0571 vs. 0.0083,
respectively; p ≤ 0.0061). B*62 frequencies were lower in three IgGSD subgroups
than controls (p < 0.0001, respectively). A*02, B*44 frequency was higher in
subnormal IgG1/IgG3 patients than controls (0.1282 vs. 0.0632, respectively;
p = 0.0024). A*02, B*60 frequency was lower in subnormal IgG3 patients than
controls (0.0 vs. 0.0233, respectively; p = 0.0051). HLA-B*35 and -B*40
frequencies differ significantly between some IgGSD subgroups. B*62, A*02, B*44, 
and A*02, B*60 frequencies differ significantly between some IgGSD subgroups and 
controls.
