Respiration in plants, most animals and many aerobic microbes is dependent on
heme A. This is a highly specialized type of heme found as prosthetic group in
cytochrome a-containing respiratory oxidases. Heme A differs structurally from
heme B (protoheme IX) by the presence of a hydroxyethylfarnesyl group instead of 
a vinyl side group at the C2 position and a formyl group instead of a methyl side
group at position C8 of the porphyrin macrocycle. Heme A synthase catalyzes the
formation of the formyl side group and is a poorly understood heme-containing
membrane bound atypical monooxygenase. This review presents our current
understanding of heme A synthesis at the molecular level in mitochondria and
aerobic bacteria. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:
Biogenesis/Assembly of Respiratory Enzyme Complexes.
