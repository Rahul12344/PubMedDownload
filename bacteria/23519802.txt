The VAR2CSA protein has been closely associated with pregnancy-associated malaria
and is recognized as the main adhesin exposed on the surface of Plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Chondroitin sulfate A was identified as the
main host receptor in the placenta. Single-domain heavy-chain camelid antibodies,
more commonly called nanobodies, were selected and produced against the
DBL6ℇ-FCR3 domain of VAR2CSA. Crystals of two specific nanobodies, Nb2907 and
Nb2919, identified as strong binders to DBL6ℇ-FCR3 and the full-length VAR2CSA
exposed on the surface of FCR3 P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, were
obtained. Crystals of Nb2907 diffract to 2.45 Å resolution and belong to space
group C2 with unit-cell parameters a=136.1, b=78.5, c=103.4 Å, β=118.8°, whereas 
Nb2919 crystals diffract to 2.15 Å resolution and belong to space group P4₃2₁2
with unit-cell parameters a=b=62.7, c=167.2 Å.
