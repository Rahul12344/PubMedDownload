Antitermination is a regulatory process based on the competitive folding of
terminator-antiterminator structures that can form in the leader region of
nascent transcripts. In the case of the Bacillus subtilis licS gene involved in
β-glucosides utilization, the binding of the antitermination protein LicT to a
short RNA hairpin (RAT) prevents the formation of an overlapping terminator and
thereby allows transcription to proceed. Here, we monitored in vitro the
competition between termination and antitermination by combining bulk and
single-molecule fluorescence-based assays using labeled RNA oligonucleotide
constructs of increasing length that mimic the progressive transcription of the
terminator invading the antiterminator hairpin. Although high affinity binding is
abolished as soon as the antiterminator basal stem is disrupted by the invading
terminator, LicT can still bind and promote closing of the partially unfolded RAT
hairpin. However, binding no longer occurs once the antiterminator structure has 
been disrupted by the full-length terminator. Based on these findings, we propose
a kinetic competition model for the sequential events taking place at the
termination-antitermination site, where LicT needs to capture its RAT target
before completion of the terminator to remain tightly bound during RNAP pausing, 
before finally dissociating irreversibly from the elongated licS transcript.
