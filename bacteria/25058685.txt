Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and
Clostridium difficile CDT belong to the family of binary actin ADP-ribosylating
toxins and are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate
enzyme component. The enzyme components ADP-ribosylate G-actin in the cytosol of 
target cells resulting in depolymerization of F-actin, cell rounding and cell
death. The binding/translocation components bind to their cell receptors and form
complexes with the respective enzyme components. After receptor-mediated
endocytosis, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of
acidified endosomes and the enzyme components translocate through these pores
into the cytosol. This step is facilitated by the host cell chaperone heat shock 
protein 90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases including cyclophilin A.
Here, we demonstrate that a large isoform of cyclophilin A, the multi-domain
enzyme cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), binds to the enzyme components C2I, Ia and CDTa in
vitro. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a direct binding to C2I with a
calculated affinity of 101 nM and to Ia with an affinity of 1.01 μM. Closer
investigation for the prototypic C2I revealed that binding to Cyp40 did not
depend on its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but was stronger for unfolded C2I. 
The interaction of C2I with Cyp40 was also demonstrated in lysates from
C2-treated cells by pull-down. Treatment of cells with a non-immunosuppressive
cyclosporine A derivative, which still binds to and inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl 
cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins, protected cells from intoxication
with C2, iota and CDT toxins, offering an attractive approach for development of 
novel therapeutic strategies against binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins.
