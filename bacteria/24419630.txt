L-arabinose isomerase (AI), which catalyzes the isomerization of L-arabinose to
L-ribulose, can also convert D-galactose to D-tagatose, a natural sugar replacer,
which is of commercial interest in the food and healthcare industries.
Intriguingly, mesophilic and thermophilic AIs showed different substrate
preferences and metal requirements in catalysis and different thermostabilities. 
However, the catalytic mechanism of thermophilic AIs still remains unclear.
Therefore, thermophilic Geobacillus kaustophilus AI (GKAI) was overexpressed,
purified and crystallized, and a preliminary X-ray diffraction data set was
obtained. Diffraction data were collected from a GKAI crystal to 2.70 Å
resolution. The crystal belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell
parameters a = 224.12, b = 152.95, c = 91.28 Å, β = 103.61°. The asymmetric unit 
contained six molecules, with a calculated Matthews coefficient of
2.25 Å(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 45.39%. The three-dimensional structure
determination of GKAI is currently in progress by molecular replacement and model
building.
