CD28 is a cell surface molecule that mediates a costimulatory signal crucial for 
T cell proliferation and lymphokine production. The signal transduction
mechanisms of CD28 are not well understood. Itk, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine
kinase specifically expressed in T cells and mast cells, has been implicated in
the CD28 signaling pathway because of reports that it becomes phosphorylated on
tyrosines and associates with CD28 upon cross-linking of the cell surface
molecule. To determine whether Itk plays a functional role in CD28 signaling, we 
compared T cells from Itk-deficient mice and control mice for their responses to 
CD28 costimulation. T cells defective in Itk were found to be fully competent to 
respond to costimulation. Whereas the CD3-mediated proliferative response was
severely compromised in the absence of Itk, the calcineurin-independent
CD28-mediated response was significantly elevated when compared with cells from
control animals. The augmented proliferation was not due to increased production 
of interleukin-2. The results suggest that Itk has distinct roles in the CD3
versus the CD28 signaling pathways. By negatively regulating the amplitude of
signaling upon CD28 costimulation, Itk may provide a means for modulating the
outcome of T cell activation during development and during antigen-driven immune 
responses.
