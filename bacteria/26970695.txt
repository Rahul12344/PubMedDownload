This study explores the use of materials such as chitosan (chit), polyaniline
(PANI) and titanium carbide (TC) as anode materials for microbial fuel cells.
Nickel foam (NF) was used as the base anode substrate. Four different types of
anodes (NF, NF/PANI, NF/PANI/TC, NF/PANI/TC/Chit) are thus prepared and used in
batch type microbial fuel cells operated with a mixed consortium of Acetobacter
aceti and Gluconobacter roseus as the biocatalysts and bad wine as a feedstock. A
maximum power density of 18.8Wm(-3) (≈2.3 times higher than NF) was obtained in
the case of the anode modified with a composite of PANI/TC/Chit. The MFCs running
under a constant external resistance of (50Ω) yielded 14.7% coulombic efficiency 
with a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 87-93%. The overall
results suggest that the catalytic materials embedded in the chitosan matrix show
the best performance and have potentials for further development.
