Due to a multiplicity of causes provoking traumatic brain injury (TBI), TBI is a 
highly heterogeneous pathology, characterized by high mortality and disability
rates. TBI is an acute neurodegenerative event, potentially and unpredictably
evolving into sub-chronic and chronic neurodegenerative events, with transient or
permanent neurologic, cognitive, and motor deficits, for which no valid
standardized therapies are available. A vast body of literature demonstrates that
TBI-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress is involved in the development of both
acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Cellular defenses against this
phenomenon are largely dependent on low molecular weight antioxidants, most of
which are consumed with diet or as nutraceutical supplements. A large number of
studies have evaluated the efficacy of antioxidant administration to decrease
TBI-associated damage in various animal TBI models and in a limited number of
clinical trials. Points of weakness of preclinical studies are represented by the
large variability in the TBI model adopted, in the antioxidant tested, in the
timing, dosages, and routes of administration used, and in the variety of
molecular and/or neurocognitive parameters evaluated. The analysis of the very
few clinical studies does not allow strong conclusions to be drawn on the real
effectiveness of antioxidant administration to TBI patients. Standardizing TBI
models and different experimental conditions, as well as testing the efficacy of 
administration of a cocktail of antioxidants rather than only one, should be
mandatory. According to some promising clinical results, it appears that
sports-related concussion is probably the best type of TBI to test the benefits
of antioxidant administration.
