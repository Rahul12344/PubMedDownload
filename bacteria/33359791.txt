Aberrant expression of CA125/MUC16 is associated with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression and metastasis. However, knowledge of the
contribution of MUC16 to pancreatic tumorigenesis is limited. Here, we show that 
MUC16 expression is associated with disease progression, basal-like and squamous 
tumor subtypes, increased tumor metastasis, and short-term survival of PDAC
patients. MUC16 enhanced tumor malignancy through the activation of AKT and GSK3β
oncogenic signaling pathways. Activation of these oncogenic signaling pathways
resulted in part from increased interactions between MUC16 and epidermal growth
factor (EGF)-type receptors, which were enhanced for aberrant glycoforms of
MUC16. Treatment of PDAC cells with monoclonal antibody (mAb) AR9.6 significantly
reduced MUC16-induced oncogenic signaling. mAb AR9.6 binds to a unique
conformational epitope on MUC16, which is influenced by O-glycosylation.
Additionally, treatment of PDAC tumor-bearing mice with either mAb AR9.6 alone or
in combination with gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor growth and
metastasis. We conclude that the aberrant expression of MUC16 enhances PDAC
progression to an aggressive phenotype by modulating oncogenic signaling through 
ErbB receptors. Anti-MUC16 mAb AR9.6 blocks oncogenic activities and tumor growth
and could be a novel immunotherapeutic agent against MUC16-mediated PDAC tumor
malignancy.
