Pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus is coordinated by the accessory gene
regulator (agr) system. Previous studies suggested that agr Group II
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a polymorphism that has been associated
with moderate response to vancomycin, may also be related with overproduction of 
biofilm. In a hospital environment with endemic occurrence of MRSA, the
distribution of agr groups and their association with biofilm formation was
investigated. Forty-two MRSA and 32 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)
isolates were tested and had derived from 10 genotypes and 8 clonal complexes.
agr Groups I, II and IV were evenly distributed among MRSAs and MSSAs but agr
Group III was not detected. agr Group II MRSAs showed significantly higher levels
of biofilm production in comparison with MRSAs of the remaining agr groups as
well as with all three agr groups of MSSAs. These findings suggest that agr Group
II is simultaneously associated with methicillin-resistance and biofilm
overproduction in a region with endemic MRSA.
