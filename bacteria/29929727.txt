IL-13 receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Rα1) associates with IL-4Rα to form a functional
IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 heteroreceptor (HR) through which both IL-4 and IL-13 signal.
Recently, HR expression was associated with the development of M2 type
macrophages which function as antigen presenting cells (APCs). Herein, we show
that a subset of thymic resident dendritic cells (DCs) expressing high CD11b
(CD11bhi) and intermediate CD11c (CD11cint) arise in HR-sufficient but not
HR-deficient mice. These DCs, which originate from the bone marrow are able to
take up Ag from the peritoneum, traffic through the spleen and the lymph nodes
and carry it to the thymus. In addition, since the DCs are able to present Ag to 
T cells, express high levels of the costimulatory molecule CD24, and comprise a
CD8α+ subset, it is likely that the cells contribute to T cell development and
perhaps negative selection of self-reactive lymphocytes.
