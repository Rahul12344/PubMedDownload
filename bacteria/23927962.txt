OBJECTIVE: Abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is common
in human cancers, including cervical cancer. Many papers have shown that SRY
(sex-determining region Y)-box (SOX) family genes serve as either tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs) or oncogenes by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway in
different cancers. We have demonstrated recently that epigenetic silencing of
SOX1 gene occurs frequently in cervical cancer. However, the possible role of
SOX1 in cervical cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether SOX1
functions as a TSG in cervical cancer.
METHODS: We established a constitutive and an inducible system that overexpressed
SOX1 and monitored its function by in vitro experiments. To confirm SOX1
function, we manipulated SOX1 using an inducible expression approach in cell
lines. The effect of SOX1 on tumorigenesis was also analyzed in animal models.
RESULTS: Overexpression of SOX1 inhibited cell proliferation, anchorage
independency, and invasion in vitro. SOX1 suppressed tumor growth in nonobese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice. After induction of SOX1 by
doxycycline (DOX), SOX1 inhibited cell growth and invasion in the inducible
system. Repression of SOX1 by withdrawal of DOX partially reversed the malignant 
phenotype in cervical cells. SOX1 inhibited TCF-dependent transcriptional
activity and the Wnt target genes. SOX1 also repressed the invasive phenotype by 
regulating the expression of invasion-related genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that SOX1 can function as a tumor
suppressor partly by interfering with Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cervical cancer.
