Thraustochytrium is a unicellular marine protist for the commercial production of
very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs). Biosynthesis of these
VLCPUFAs in the protist is catalysed by a PUFA synthase comprising three
subunits, each with multiple catalytic domains. Among these domains, two tandem
FabA-like dehydratase domains (DH1 and DH2) in subunit-C together are responsible
for introducing double bonds in VLCPUFAs. Domain swapping analysis in yeast
showed that the defective phenotype of a Scfas1 mutant could be complemented by
expressing an engineered ScFAS1 gene in which the DH domain was replaced by a
single DH1 or mutated DH2 of the two. Heterologous expression of the PUFA
synthase in E. coli showed that the mutation of DH1 of the two or deletion of DH1
or substitution of DH1 with DH2 resulted in the complete loss of activity in the 
biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs. Mutation of DH2 of the two or deletion of the DH2
domain produced a small amount of DPA, but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These 
results indicate that each of the two FabA-like domains of the PUFA synthase
possesses distinct function. DH1 domain is essential for the biosynthesis of
VLCPUFAs, but DH2 domain is required for the biosynthesis of DHA.
