The fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 exhibits aberrant tyrosine kinase activity and it
has been proposed that it deregulates signaling networks involving both
transcription factors and non-coding microRNAs that result in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML). Previously, microRNA expression profiling showed deregulated
expression of miR-150 and miR-155 in CML. In this study, we placed these findings
into the broader context of the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU.1 oncogenic network.
We propose that up-regulated MYC and miR-155 in CD34+ leukemic stem and
progenitor cells, in concert with BCR-ABL1, impair the molecular mechanisms of
myeloid differentiation associated with low miR-150 and PU.1 levels. We revealed 
that MYC directly occupied the -11.7 kb and -0.35 kb regulatory regions in the
MIR150 gene. MYC occupancy was markedly increased through BCR-ABL1 activity,
causing inhibition of MIR150 gene expression in CML CD34+ and CD34- cells.
Furthermore, we found an association between reduced miR-150 levels in CML blast 
cells and their resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although TKIs
successfully disrupted BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in proliferating CML cells, this 
treatment did not efficiently target quiescent leukemic stem cells. The study
presents new evidence regarding the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU.1 leukemic network
established by aberrant BCR-ABL1 activity. The key connecting nodes of this
network may serve as potential druggable targets to overcome resistance of CML
stem and progenitor cells.
