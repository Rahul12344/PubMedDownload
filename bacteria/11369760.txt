CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule implicated in leukocyte adhesion and migration, 
co-stimulation of T cells, and tumor metastasis. CD45 is a leukocyte-specific
protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates the Src family kinases, Lck
and Fyn, in T cells. Positive regulation of Lck by CD45 is required for its
effective participation in T cell receptor signaling events. Here, immobilized
CD44 antibody induced a distinctive cell spreading in CD45(-), but not CD45(+), T
cells, and this correlated with the induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated
proteins. Two focal adhesion family kinases, Pyk2 and, to a lesser extent, FAK
were inducibly phosphorylated, as was a potential substrate, Cas. CD44-mediated
cell spreading and induced tyrosine phosphorylation were prevented by the Src
family kinase inhibitor, PP2. Furthermore, 2-fold more Lck associated with CD44
in the low density sucrose fraction from CD45(-) T cells compared with CD45(+) T 
cells, suggesting that CD45 may regulate the association of Lck with CD44 in this
fraction. Therefore, in CD45(-) T cells, CD44 signaling is mediated by Src family
kinases, and this leads to Pyk2 phosphorylation, cytoskeletal changes, and cell
spreading. This implicates CD45 in the negative regulation of Src family
kinase-mediated CD44 signaling leading to T cell spreading.
