BACKGROUND: Hypobaric hypoxia has been reported to cause endothelial cell and
platelet dysfunction implicated in the formation of microvascular lesions, and in
its extremes may contribute to vascular leakage in high altitude pulmonary edema 
or blood brain barrier disruption leading to cerebral micro-hemorrhage (MH).
Platelet function in the development of microvascular lesions remained ill
defined, and is still incompletely understood. In this study platelet- and
endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (PEV and EEV, respectively) and
cell adhesion molecules were characterized in plasma samples of members of a high
altitude expedition to delineate the contribution of platelets and endothelial
cells to hypobaric hypoxia-induced vascular dysfunction.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this observational study, platelet and endothelial
cell-derived extracellular vesicles were analysed by flow-cytometry in plasma
samples from 39 mountaineers participating in a medical research climbing
expedition to Himlung Himal, Nepal, 7,050m asl. Megakaryocyte/platelet-derived
AnnexinVpos, PECAM-1 (CD31) and glycoprotein-1b (GP1b, CD42b) positive
extracellular vesicles (PEV) constituted the predominant fraction of EV in plasma
samples up to 6,050m asl. Exposure to an altitude of 7,050m led to a marked
decline of CD31pos CD42neg EEV as well as of CD31pos CD42bpos PEV at the same
time giving rise to a quantitatively prevailing CD31neg CD42blow/neg
subpopulation of AnnexinVpos EV. An almost hundredfold increase in the numbers of
this previously unrecognized population of CD31neg CD42blow/neg EV was observed
in all participants reaching 7,050m asl.
CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of CD31neg CD42blow/neg EV was observed in all
participants and thus represents an early hypoxic marker at extreme altitude.
Since CD31 and CD42b are required for platelet-endothelial cell interactions,
these hypobaric hypoxia-dependent quantitative and phenotypic changes of
AnnexinVpos EV subpopulations may serve as early and sensitive indicators of
compromised vascular homeostasis.
