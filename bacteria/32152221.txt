BACKGROUND: CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells demonstrate remarkable
remission rates in pediatric and adult patients with refractory or relapsed (r/r)
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In 2016, we 
initiated a clinical trial with in-house produced CD19 CAR-T cells with a CD28
co-stimulatory domain. We analyzed, for the first time, differences in production
features and phenotype between ALL and NHL patients.
METHODS: Non-cryopreserved CAR-T cells were produced from patients' peripheral
blood mononuclear cells within 9 to 10 days. 93 patients with r/r ALL and NHL
were enrolled under the same study. CAR-T cells of ALL and NHL patients were
produced simultaneously, allowing the head-to-head comparison.
RESULTS: All patients were heavily pretreated. Three patients dropped out from
the study due to clinical deterioration (n=2) or production failure (n=1). Cells 
of ALL patients (n=37) expanded significantly better and contained more CAR-T
cells than of NHL patients (n=53). Young age had a positive impact on the
proliferation capacity. The infusion products from ALL patients contained
significantly more naïve CAR-T cells and a significantly higher expression of the
chemokine receptor CXCR3. PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CD28 were equally expressed.
100% of ALL patients and 94% of NHL patients received the target dose of 1×10e6
CAR-T/kg. The overall response rate was 84% (30/36) in ALL and 62% (32/52) in
NHL. We further compared CAR-T cell infusion products to tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL), another common type of T cell therapy, mainly clinically
effective in solid tumors. CAR-T cells contained significantly more naïve T cells
and central memory T cells and significantly less CCR5 compared to TIL infusion
products.
CONCLUSIONS: The in-house production of CAR-T cells is highly efficient and fast.
Clinical response rate is high. CAR-T cells can be successfully produced for 99% 
of patients in just 9 to 10 days. Cells derived from ALL patients demonstrate a
higher proliferation rate and contain higher frequencies of CAR-T cells and naïve
T cells than of NHL patients. In addition, understanding the differences between 
CAR-T and TIL infusion products, may provide an angle to develop CAR-T cells for 
the treatment of solid tumors in the future.
