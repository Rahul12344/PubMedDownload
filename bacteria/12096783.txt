T-cell activation requires both T-cell receptor signaling and a costimulatory
signal provided by CD28 which enhances and prolongs interleukin-2 (IL-2)
production. To determine the effect of cyclosporine A (CsA) on constitutive and
activation-induced CD28 expression, mouse T cells were exposed to CsA (0.1
microM) in the absence or presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). CD28
expression was then determined by flow cytometry. CsA treatment prevented
activation-induced CD28 expression but did not affect constitutive CD28
expression. Inhibition of inducible CD28 expression by CsA was not rapidly
reversible, requiring 48h of restimulation in the absence of CsA for CD28
expression to return to control levels. T cells activated in the presence of
combined anti-IL-2 and anti-CD25 mAb (both 10 microg/mL) also exhibited reduced
CD28 expression, suggesting that activation-induced CD28 expression is, at least 
in part, an IL-2-dependent process. However, the inhibitory effect of CsA on
activation-induced CD28 expression was maintained in the presence of exogenous
IL-2 (250 U/mL). We conclude that CsA, by inhibiting activation-induced
expression of costimulatory CD28 molecules by T lymphocytes, may interfere with
the ability of CD28 to provide an optimal costimulatory signal for sustained IL-2
production following T-cell activation.
