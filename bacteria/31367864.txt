Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by bad prognosis and is the
second most common reason for cancer-linked mortality. Treatment with sorafenib
(SRF) alone increases patient survival by only a few months. A causal link has
been determined between angiotensin II (Ang-II) and HCC. However, the mechanisms 
underlying the tumorigenic effects of Ang-II remain to be elucidated.
N-Nitrosodiethylamine was utilized to examine the effects of telmisartan (TEL)
(15 mg/kg), SRF (30 mg/kg), and a combination of these two agents on HCC mice.
Downregulation of NF-кBP65 mRNA expression and inhibition of the
phosphorylation-induced activation of both ERK1/2 and NF-кB P65 were implicated
in the anti-tumor effects of TEL and SRF. Consequent regression of malignant
changes and improvements in liver function associated with reduced levels of AFP,
TNF-α, and TGF-β1 were also confirmed. Anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and
anti-angiogenic effects of treatment were indicated by reduced hepatic cyclin D1 
mRNA expression, reduced MMP-2 levels, and reduced VEGF levels, respectively.
TEL, but not SRF, demonstrated agonistic activity for PPARγ receptors, as
evidenced by increased PPARγ DNA binding activity, upregulation of CD36, and HO-1
mRNA expression followed by increased liver antioxidant capacity. Both TEL and
SRF inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation-induced activation, indicating that TAK1 might
act as a central mediator in the interaction between ERK1/2 and NF-кB. TEL, by
modulating the ERK1/2, TAK1, and NF-кB signaling axis in the context of PPARγ
agonistic activity, exerted anti-tumor effects and increased tumor sensitivity to
SRF. Therefore, TEL is an encouraging agent for further clinical trials regarding
the management of HCC.
