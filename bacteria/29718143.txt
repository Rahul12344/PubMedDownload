Background: Empirical colistin should be avoided. We aimed to evaluate the
association between covering empirical antibiotics (EAT) and mortality for
infections caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB).
Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,
including adults with bloodstream infections, pneumonia, or urosepsis caused by
CRGNB. All patients received EAT followed by covering targeted therapy. The
exposure variable was covering EAT in the first 48 hours. The outcome was 28-day 
mortality. We adjusted the analyses by multivariable regression analysis and
propensity score matching.
Results: The study included 406 inpatients with severe CRGNB infections, mostly
Acinetobacter baumannii (312/406 [77%]). Covering EAT was given to 209 (51.5%)
patients, mostly colistin (n = 200). Patients receiving noncovering EAT were
older, more frequently unconscious and dependent, carrying catheters, and
mechanically ventilated with pneumonia. Mortality was 84 of 197 (42.6%) with
noncovering vs 96 of 209 (45.9%) with covering EAT (P = .504). Covering EAT was
not associated with survival in the adjusted analysis; rather, there was a weak
association with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.02-1.84). Results were similar for colistin monotherapy and colistin-carbapenem
combination EAT. In the propensity score-matched cohort (n = 338) covering
antibiotics were not significantly associated with mortality (OR, 1.42; 95% CI,
.91-2.22). Similar results were obtained in an analysis of 14-day mortality.
Conclusions: Empirical use of colistin before pathogen identification, with or
without a carbapenem, was not associated with survival following severe
infections caused by CRGNBs, mainly A. baumannii.
