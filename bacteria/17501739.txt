Aeromonas isolates were collected from cultured fish, characterized
phenotypically and identified to species using 16S rDNA. The pathogenicity of all
isolates was assayed on the basis of haemolytic and proteolytic activity and
challenge tests were performed for isolates from healthy fish. A total of 131
Aeromonas isolates were obtained and identified as follows: A. hydrophila (13),
A. bestiarum (23), A. salmonicida (motile biogroup) (19), A. caviae (2), A.
sobria (18), A. veronii bt. sobria (42), A. jandaei (1), A. encheleia (11) and A.
allosaccharophila (2). All isolates of A. hydrophila and A. bestiarum and most
isolates of A. salmonicida and A. veronii were classified as pathogenic.
Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated only from diseased trout except for one isolate
obtained from carp fry. The other potentially pathogenic Aeromonas species were
present in diseased as well as healthy fish. The pathogenicity of isolates from
healthy fish was correlated with their enzymatic activity and was also tested by 
challenge experiments. The dominant pathogenic species were A. veronii bt.
sobria, A. bestiarum and A. salmonicida in common carp and A. hydrophila in
rainbow trout.
