Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an incurable autosomal dominant
disease caused by an expansion of a CAG repeats in ATN1 gene encoding atrophin 1 
protein. Here we report the generation of IBCHi001-A, an induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC) line derived from DRPLA patient fibroblasts using non-integrative
reprogramming technology with OCT4, SOX2, cMYC and KLF4 reprogramming factors.
The pluripotency of iPSC was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and PCR for
pluripotency markers and by the ability to form three germ layers in vitro. The
established iPSC line offers a useful resource to study the pathogenesis of
DPRLA.
