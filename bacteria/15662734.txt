In order to analyze the relationship of HLA polymorphisms and the infection of H.
pylori in the population of Linqu County in Shandong Province, polymerase chain
reaction with sequence-specific primers(PCR-SSP) was used to determine the
alleles of HLA type I and II in 90 Hp-positive persons and 49 Hp-negative
controls. The results showed that among the 68 alleles of HLA type I ,4 alleles
were found significantly different between Hp-positive and Hp-negative
population,while no significant difference was found among the 22 alleles of HLA 
type UI. Hp-positive persons had a lower allele frequency of A* 02 (OR=0.56, 95% 
CI=0.33 approximately 0. 94; P=0.029), B* 48 (OR=0.15, 95% CI=0.03 approximately 
0.72; P=0. 007), CW* 08 (OR=0. 32, 95% CI=0.15 approximately 0.69; P=0. 003) and 
a higher allele frequency of CW* 15 (OR=5.11, 95% CI=0.63 approximately 40.90;
P=0. 024) compared with Hp-negative controls. Our results indicated that the
polymorphisms of HLA type I is involved in the genetic susceptibility of Hp
infection in Linqu County,while the polymorphisms of HLA type I may have no
relationship with the genetic susceptibility of Hp infection. It was shown that
among the alleles of HLA type I , CW* 15 might be a susceptible gene of Hp
infection while A * 02 ,B * 48 and CW* 08 might be protective genes.
