P. falciparum malaria is associated with increased activation among peripheral
lymphocytes. In the present study, we investigated markers of susceptibility to
apoptosis and expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4 by CD28-and CD28+T cells in West
African children with acute P. falciparum malaria. The study showed increased
susceptibility to apoptosis and cytokine production among T lymphocytes during
acute malaria but also that T cells, in particular IFN-gamma producing CD28-T
cells, were substantially reduced. These results are in line with previous
studies suggesting that certain T cell subsets are sequestered away from the
peripheral blood during P. falciparum malaria.
