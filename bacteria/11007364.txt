Advances in our understanding of T cell costimulatory molecules have provided a
vast array of novel approaches to tumor immunotherapy. In the past year,
combinatorial immunotherapy based on earlier studies of CTLA-4 blockade, the
identification of novel B7-family members, the modulation of CD40 to reverse
tolerance to tumor-associated antigens and the use of OX40 to enhance antitumor
responses of CD4+ T cells have all contributed to the development of
more-powerful immunomodulatory cancer therapies.
