INTRODUCTION: Papillary Glioneuronal Tumor (PGNT) is a grade I tumor which was
classified as a separate entity in the World Health Organization Classification
of the Central Nervous System 2007 in the group of mixed glioneuronal tumors.
This tumor is rare and subclassifying PGNT represents a challenge. Recently, a
fusion between SLC44A1 and PRKCA which encodes a protein kinase C involved in
MAPK signaling pathway has been described in two studies (five cases). The
current study aimed at raising the cytogenetic, histological and molecular
profiles of PGNT and to determine if SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion represented a specific 
diagnostic marker to distinguish it from other glioneuronal tumors.
RESULTS: We report on four pediatric cases of PGNT, along with clinico-radiologic
and immunohistological features for which SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion assessment by
fluorescence in situ hybridization, BRAF V600E and FGFR1 mutation by
immunohistochemistry and direct DNA sequencing and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion by RT-PCR
were performed. MAPK signaling pathway activation was investigated using
phospho-ERK immunohistochemistry and western blot. We analyzed fifteen cases of
tumors with challenging histological or clinical differential diagnoses showing
respectively a papillary architecture or periventricular location (PGNT mimics). 
fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a constant SLC44A1-PRKCA
fusion signal in all PGNTs. None of PGNT mimics showed the SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion
signal pattern. All PGNTs were negative for BRAF V600E and FGFR1 mutation, and
KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Phospho-ERK analysis provides arguments for the activation 
of the MAPK signaling pathway in these tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we confirmed and extended the molecular data on PGNT. These
results suggest that PGNT belong to low grade glioma with MAPK signaling pathway 
deregulation. SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion seems to be a specific characteristic of PGNT 
with a high diagnostic value and detectable by FISH.
