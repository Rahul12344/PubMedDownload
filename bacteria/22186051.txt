Antibacterial polymers suitable for coating applications without leaching of the 
biocidal component have been obtained by UV copolymerization of acrylic resins
with acrylic monomers containing quaternary ammonium moieties. Suitable reactive 
biocides, based on quaternary ammonium monomers (QAMs), endowed with
undecylacryloyl group and alkyl chains with 2 (QAM-C2), 8 (QAM-C8), and 16
(QAM-C16) carbon atoms have been synthesized. Aqueous solutions of QAMs showed
biocidal activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria
monocytogenes strains both in suspension and adhered to stainless steel surfaces.
QAM-C16 and QAM-C8 evidenced higher activity toward bacteria in suspension and on
stainless steel, respectively. The QAMs have shown sufficient reactivity to be
copolymerized, by UV irradiation, with a commercial urethane acrylic resin for
coating. Bioactivity tests, performed on free films of crosslinked coatings
containing 1% of copolymerized QAM, have shown an increasing inactivation effect 
in the order of magnitude L. monocytogenes, E. coli, S. aureus with a maximum
activity of the QAM-C8.
