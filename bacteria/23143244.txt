Dioxygen activation implemented by nonhaem Fe(II) enzymes containing the
2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad has been extensively studied in recent years.
Extradiol dioxygenase is the archetypal member of this superfamily and catalyzes 
the oxygenolytic ring opening of catechol analogues. Here, the crystallization
and preliminary X-ray analysis of 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase, an enzyme
representing a minor subset of extradiol dioxygenases that catalyze the fission
of 2-aminophenol rather than catecholic compounds, is reported. Crystals of the
holoenzyme with FeII and of complexes with the substrate 2-aminophenol and the
suicide inhibitor 4-nitrocatechol were grown using the cocrystallization method
under the same conditions as used for the crystallization of the apoenzyme. The
crystals belonged to space group C2 and diffracted to 2.3-2.7 Å resolution; the
crystal that diffracted to the highest resolution had unit-cell parameters
a=270.24, b=48.39, c=108.55 Å, β=109.57°. All X-ray data sets collected from
diffraction-quality crystals were suitable for structure determination.
