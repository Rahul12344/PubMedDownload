The lymphoid chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 are known to be crucial both for lymphoid
cell trafficking and for the structural organization of lymphoid tissues such as 
nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). However, their role in allergic
responses remains unclear, and so our current study aims to shed light on the
role of CCL19/CCL21 in the development of allergic rhinitis. After nasal
challenge with OVA, OVA-sensitized plt (paucity of lymph node T cells) mice,
which are deficient in CCL19/CCL21, showed more severe allergic symptoms than did
identically treated wild-type mice. OVA-specific IgE production, eosinophil
infiltration, and Th2 responses were enhanced in the upper airway of plt mice.
Moreover, in plt mice, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells declined in
the secondary lymphoid tissues, whereas the number of Th2-inducer-type
CD8alpha(-)CD11b(+) myeloid dendritic cells (m-DCs) increased in cervical lymph
nodes and NALT. Nasal administration of the plasmid-encoding DNA of CCL19
resulted in the reduction of m-DCs in the secondary lymphoid tissues and the
suppression of allergic responses in plt mice. These results suggest that
CCL19/CCL21 act as regulatory chemokines for the control of airway allergic
disease and so may offer a new strategy for the control of allergic disease.
