Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) is a soluble decoy receptor belonging to the tumor
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, and its expression is not only
up-regulated in cancer cells derived from various cell lineages, but also
correlates with overall survival of patients with cancer. It has been shown that 
DcR3 sensitize cells of hematopoietic origin to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis; therefore, we asked whether DcR3 down-regulated
host immunity by inducing immune cell apoptosis. We demonstrate that DcR3 induces
dendritic cell (DC) apoptosis by activating PKC-delta and JNK subsequently to
up-regulate DR5 to recruit Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to propagate the
apoptotic signals. The association of FADD with DR5 results in the formation of
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to trigger the downstream apoptotic
signaling cascade. PKC-delta is activated via cross-linking of heparan sulfate
proteoglycan (HSPG) on DCs, because recombinant protein containing the
heparin-binding domain (HBD) of DcR3 and the Fc portion of IgG(1), the HBD.Fc
fusion protein, is also able to trigger DC apoptosis. This provides the first
evidence that cross-linking of HSPG on DCs can activate PKC-delta to induce DC
apoptosis via the formation of DR5 DISC, and elucidates a novel mechanism of
DcR3-mediated immunosuppression.
