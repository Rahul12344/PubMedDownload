Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the downstream adaptor protein MyD88 are considered
crucial for protective immunity during bacterial infections. Streptococcus (S.)
pneumoniae is a human respiratory pathogen and a large majority of clinical
pneumococcal isolates expresses an external polysaccharide capsule. We here
sought to determine the role of pneumococcal capsule in MyD88-mediated
antibacterial defense during S. pneumonia pneumonia. Wild type (WT) and
Myd88(-/-) mice were inoculated intranasally with serotype 2 S. pneumoniae D39 or
with an isogenic capsule locus deletion mutant (D39∆cps), and analysed for
bacterial outgrowth and inflammatory responses in the lung. As compared to WT
mice, Myd88(-/-) mice infected with D39 demonstrated a modestly impaired
bacterial clearance accompanied by decreased inflammatory responses in the lung. 
Strikingly, while WT mice rapidly cleared D39∆cps, Myd88(-/-) mice showed
105-fold higher bacterial burdens in their lungs and dissemination to blood 24
hours after infection. These data suggest that the pneumococcal capsule impairs
recognition of TLR ligands expressed by S. pneumoniae and thereby partially
impedes MyD88-mediated antibacterial defense.
