In order to construct a recombinant plasmid initiating the polarization and
activation of the regulatory T cells (Treg), the fragments of hTGF-β1 and C2-C4
of gp120 amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pCR2.1 vector respectively. hTGF-β1 
and C2-C4 DNA fragments were obtained, then sub-cloned to generate the
prokaryotic expression vector named pET-28a/C2-C4-Linker- hTGF-β1. The expression
of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG (0.1 mmol/L) for 6 hours. The results 
showed that the fragments of hTGF-β1 and C2-C4 were amplified and cloned into
pCR2.1, the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a/C2-C4-Linker- hTGF-β1 was
constructed successfully. The recombinant protein was expressed as inclusion body
after being induced by IPTG. It is concluded that this recombinant protein can
initiate the polarization and activation of Treg cells, indicating the
engineering E.coli strain is successfully obtained.
