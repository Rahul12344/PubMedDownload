The isolation of Helicobacter pylori from the human stomach produced significant 
changes in how gastroenterologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, pathologists 
and microbiologists have approached gastro-duodenal diseases in the last half of 
the XX century. However, research of this organism has progressed greatly in the 
first decade of this century, evidence suggest that H. pylori is associated with 
disease only in humans older than 40 years, while, the lack of H. pylori
colonization is associated with the emergence of new diseases, particularly in
younger individuals. These differing effects of H. pylori colonization have
created two contrasting concepts: the 'bad' and the 'good' Helicobacter.
Following from renewed interest in the normal human microbiome, we need to
reconsider our definitions and perhaps recognize that H. pylori might be a normal
member of the human gastric microbiome in ancient humans that gradually, as
results of the improvement in our environment, is disappearing.
