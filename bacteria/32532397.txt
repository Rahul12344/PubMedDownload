Here, we describe a green approach to fabricate genipin crosslinked
chitosan-kappa-carrageenan composite hydrogels (C-K hydrogels) aiming at reducing
endotoxin level and bacteria burden in septic blood synchronously. The chemical
compositions and morphologies of the developed C-K hydrogels were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 
scanning electron microscopy. The C-K hydrogels significantly inhibited adverse
blood-material interactions such as hemolysis, complement activation, platelet
activation and contact activation, and exhibited better anticoagulant properties 
than raw chitosan hydrogels. Most importantly, the optimized C2-K1 hydrogels were
competent to eliminate 63.3 % of endotoxin in septic blood with a maximum
adsorption capacity of 95.0 EU/g during a 3-h simulative hemoperfusion procedure.
Bacteria cleansing experiments further demonstrated that the optimized C2-K1
hydrogels effectively decreased 46.0 % of E. coli and 68.7 % of S. aureus load,
respectively. It is believed that the C-K hydrogels are promising hemoperfusion
sorbents to treat severe septic patients.
