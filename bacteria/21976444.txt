Nanocomposites from a polyether-type waterborne polyurethane (PU) and 0.1 wt % of
silicate materials were prepared. The individual silicate materials were natural 
clays (montmorillonite and mica), their exfoliated clays [nano silicate platelets
(NSP) and nano mica platelets], and NSP modified with C18 fatty amine (NSP-S).
The physico-chemcical properties and antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposites
were characterized in vitro. The biostability and biocompatibility of the
nanocomposites were evaluated in vivo. The nanocomposites exhibited various
surface morphologies with phase separation of hard and soft domains in nanometric
scales. The nanocomposite containing NSP (PU-NSP) showed better endothelial cell 
attachment and gene expression. The better biocompatibility of PU-NSP and
PU-NSP-S was evidenced by the lower thickness of foreign body capsules in rat
subcutaneous implantation. PU-NSP had the least surface degradation in vivo as
demonstrated by the electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. This may be
associated with the different surface structure. PU-NSP and PU-NSP-S showed
strong bacteriostatic effects, which suggested that the nano clay in the polymer 
matrix may still interact with the microbes.
