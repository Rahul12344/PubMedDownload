OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effects
of non-surgical periodontal treatment, supplemented with enamel matrix derivative
(EMD) and/or systemic antibiotics, in deep periodontal pockets of patients with
chronic periodontitis.
METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled longitudinal clinical trial of
12 months duration. Using a split-mouth design, 16 subjects were randomly
assigned to scaling and root planing (SRP) with EMD or placebo in contra-lateral 
dentition areas. One half of the subjects received 250 mg metronidazole and 375
mg amoxicillin three times a day for 7 days and the other half received a
placebo. One inter-proximal periodontal lesion was chosen as study site in each
of the contra-lateral quadrants.
RESULTS: Subjects treated with systemic antibiotics yielded significantly better 
clinical results than those treated with placebo. In these cases, probing pocket 
depth was reduced significantly more after 6 months (3.0+/-2.1 mm versus
1.6+/-1.4 mm, p=0.05), and the mean clinical attachment gain was significantly
greater after 6 months (2.3+/-1.9 mm versus 0.7+/-1.6 mm, p=0.02) and 12 months
(2.3+/-3.5 mm versus 0.4+/-3.8 mm, p=0.02). Sites treated with the antibiotics
plus EMD gained the largest amount of clinical attachment. There was no
significant benefit of EMD adjunctive to SRP in subjects not treated with
antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the notion that optimal repair and
regeneration of the periodontium requires suppression of the microbiota causing
periodontal disease.
