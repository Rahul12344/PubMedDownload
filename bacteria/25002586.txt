HLA-DM mediates the exchange of peptides loaded onto MHCII molecules during
antigen presentation by a mechanism that remains unclear and controversial. Here,
we investigated the sequence and structural determinants of HLA-DM interaction.
Peptides interacting nonoptimally in the P1 pocket exhibited low MHCII binding
affinity and kinetic instability and were highly susceptible to HLA-DM-mediated
peptide exchange. These changes were accompanied by conformational alterations
detected by surface plasmon resonance, SDS resistance assay, antibody binding
assay, gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, small angle x-ray scattering,
and NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, all of those changes could be reversed by
substitution of the P9 pocket anchor residue. Moreover, MHCII mutations outside
the P1 pocket and the HLA-DM interaction site increased HLA-DM susceptibility.
These results indicate that a dynamic MHCII conformational determinant rather
than P1 pocket occupancy is the key factor determining susceptibility to
HLA-DM-mediated peptide exchange and provide a molecular mechanism for HLA-DM to 
efficiently target unstable MHCII-peptide complexes for editing and exchange
those for more stable ones.
