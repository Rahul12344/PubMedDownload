Acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) is a major isoform of the ACOT family that
catalyzes hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA-SH. However, 
canonical and non-canonical functions of ACOT7 remain to be discovered. In this
study, for the first time, ACOT7 was shown to be responsive to genotoxic stresses
such as ionizing radiation (IR) and the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin in time- and
dose-dependent manners. ACOT7 knockdown induced cytostasis via activation of the 
p53-p21 signaling pathway without a DNA damage response. PKCζ was specifically
involved in ACOT7 depletion-mediated cell cycle arrest as an upstream molecule of
the p53-p21 signaling pathway in MCF7 human breast carcinoma and A549 human lung 
carcinoma cells. Of the other members of the ACOT family, including ACOT1, 4, 8, 
9, 11, 12, and 13 that were expressed in human, ACOT4, 8, and 12 were responsive 
to genotoxic stresses. However, none of those had a role in cytostasis via
activation of the PKCζ-p53-p21 signaling pathway. Analysis of the ACOT7
prognostic value revealed that low ACOT7 levels prolonged overall survival
periods in breast and lung cancer patients. Furthermore, ACOT7 mRNA levels were
higher in lung cancer patient tissues compared to normal tissues. We also
observed a synergistic effect of ACOT7 depletion in combination with either IR or
doxorubicin on cell proliferation in breast and lung cancer cells. Together, our 
data suggest that a low level of ACOT7 may be involved, at least in part, in the 
prevention of human breast and lung cancer development via regulation of cell
cycle progression.
