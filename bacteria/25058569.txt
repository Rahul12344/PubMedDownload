Three new siderophores, termed hyalachelins A-C (1-3), were isolated from the
terrestrial myxobacterium Hyalangium minutum. Their structures were determined by
2D NMR and HR-MS/MS experiments, and their stereochemical configuration was
established by a combination of NMR data, quantum mechanical calculations, and
circular dichroism experiments. Hyalachelins are unusual catecholate-type
siderophores that bear a
3,7,8-trihydroxy-1-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid. Their
iron chelating activities were evaluated in a CAS assay showing EC50 values of
∼30 μM.
