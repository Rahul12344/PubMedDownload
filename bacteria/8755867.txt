Two chromosomal loci containing the Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 17965 proB
and proC genes were isolated by complementation of Escherichia coli proB and proC
auxotrophic mutants. Together with a proA gene described earlier, these new genes
describe the major C. glutamicum proline biosynthetic pathway. The proB and proA 
genes, closely linked in most bacteria, are in C. glutamicum separated by a
304-amino-acid open reading frame (unk) whose predicted sequence resembles that
of the 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases. C. glutamicum mutants that carry null
alleles of proB, proA, and proC were constructed or isolated from mutagenized
cultures. Single proC mutants are auxotrophic for proline and secrete
delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which are the expected phenotypes of bacterial
proC mutants. However, the phenotypes or proB and proA mutants are unexpected. A 
proB mutant has a pleiotropic phenotype, being both proline auxotrophic and
affected in cell morphology. Null proA alleles still grow slowly under proline
starvation, which suggests that a proA-independent bypass of this metabolic step 
exists in C. glutamicum. Since proA mutants are complemented by a plasmid that
contains the wild-type asd gene of C. glutamicum, the asd gene may play a role in
this bypass.
