Members of the U-box family of proteins constitute a class of ubiquitin-protein
ligases (E3s) distinct from the HECT-type and RING finger-containing E3 families.
Two representative mammalian U-box proteins, UFD2a and CHIP, interact with the
molecular chaperones VCP and either Hsp90 or Hsc70, respectively, and are
implicated in the degradation of damaged proteins. We have now investigated the
roles of mammalian U-box proteins by performing a comprehensive screen for
molecules that interact with these proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. All
mammalian U-box proteins tested were found to interact with molecular chaperones 
or cochaperones, including Hsp90, Hsp70, DnaJc7, EKN1, CRN, and VCP. These
observations suggest that the function of U box-type E3s is to mediate the
degradation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in conjunction with molecular
chaperones as receptors that recognize such abnormal proteins.
