Process modelling of the integrated Fenton's reagent-aerobic biodegradation
system has been carried out by considering a detailed reaction mechanism for the 
chemical oxidation step and the generalised Monod equation for the biological
treatment. Chemical oxygen demand has been contemplated as a pseudo-component for
simulation purposes. The proposed mechanism takes into consideration different
features experimentally found. Thus, the inefficient hydrogen peroxide
decomposition into oxygen and water, the influence of temperature and other
operating variables and the role of oxygen have been considered. The aerobic
biodegradation of the effluent after the chemical oxidation has taken place has
been well simulated by Monod equation with no inhibitory terms. Dependency on
temperature has been correlated by Arrhenius expression.
