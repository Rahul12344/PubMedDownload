Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus was identified in humans and
animals as commensal of the gut and can act as a causative agent of endocarditis 
and septicemia. A case-control study was performed to identify yet unknown risk
factors for the transmission of this facultative pathogen. The prevalence in the 
gut of 99 healthy volunteers was determined using real-time polymerase chain
reaction resulting in 62.5% S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus positive
excrements. Subsequent cultivation offered three isolates and epidemiological
analysis based on MLST revealed sequence type (ST) 3 and ST 7, previously
detected from bovine and endocarditis patients. These results support the
hypotheses of the zoonotic potential of this bacterium. Participant
questionnaires were evaluated concerning personal characteristics, nutritional
habits and animal contact. Specifically, closer contact between participants and 
animals influenced the colonization of the human gut significantly and was
further affected if volunteers used excrement for the fertilization of plants.
