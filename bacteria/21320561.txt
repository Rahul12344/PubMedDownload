Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3) has versatile antibacterial activity against oral
bacteria and can promote the proliferation of fibroblasts. The goal of the
present study was to investigate the effect of HBD-3 on attachment and
proliferation of periodontal ligament cells (PDL) onto the periodontitis affected
root surfaces. PDL cells were seeded onto healthy and diseased root specimens
with scaling and root planing (SRP), SRP & HBD-3 (100 ng/ml), or SRP & HBD-3 (200
ng/ml) treatment for 1, 3, and 7 days incubation. The results showed that HBD-3, 
especially in the 200 ng/ml group, significantly promoted fibroblast attachment
and proliferation onto the diseased root surfaces. The cell number in the HBD-3
group was much greater than in the group treated with SRP alone. On day 7, the
cells in the HBD-3 were well-spread and formed a network similar to those on the 
surfaces of the healthy root specimens. These results suggest that HBD-3 could
play an important role in antibacterial activity and fibroblast proliferation,
thus promoting periodontal regeneration. Meanwhile, HBD-3 might act as a potent
regeneration-promoter in infectious diseases.
