Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has a significant role in the response to
injury and tissue repair, and it has been detected in various cell types.
However, the mechanism by which it regulates the response to ischemia‑reperfusion
injury (IRI) and manipulates natural killer (NK) cells is not well understood. In
the present study, TGF‑β modulated NK cell function, thereby promoting recovery
from renal IRI. Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK‑2) treated with
TGF‑β exhibited increased surface and intracellular expression of the NK group 2 
member D (NKG2D) ligand MICA. This increased surface expression of MICA inhibited
NK cell cytotoxicity to the HK‑2 cells. In addition, an enzyme‑linked
immunosorbent assay revealed that TGF‑β treatment evidently increased the amount 
of soluble MICA released into the culture supernatant from HK‑2 cells. Taken
together, these findings suggest that TGF‑β‑induced release of soluble MICA leads
to downregulation of NKG2D, thereby preventing NK cell‑mediated cytotoxicity
toward renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in renal IRI, which in turn
improves the survival of these cells.
