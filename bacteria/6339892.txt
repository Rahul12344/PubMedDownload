A total of 228 pesticides (88 insecticides, 60 fungicides, 62 herbicides, 12
plant-growth regulators, 3 metabolites and 3 other compounds) was tested for
mutagenicity in bacterial reversion-assay systems with 5 strains (TA100, TA98,
TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) of Salmonella typhimurium and a strain (WP2 hcr) of
Escherichia coli. 50 pesticides (25 insecticides, 20 fungicides, 3 herbicides, 1 
plant-growth regulator and 1 other compound) were found to be mutagenic. 5 of
them required metabolic activation (S9 mix) for their activities. Among various
chemical groups, organic phosphates, halogenated alkanes and dithiocarbamates
showed higher ratios of mutagens. Although 22 of the pesticides tested have been 
reported to be carcinogenic, 7 of them, i.e., captain, DBCP, EDB, EDC, ETU, HEH
and nitrofen, were detected as mutagens in the present assay. Most of the other
15 non-mutagenic carcinogens were organochlorine pesticides such as alpha-BHC,
chlorobenzilate, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin and quintozene.
