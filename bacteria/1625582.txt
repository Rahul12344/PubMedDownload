AIDA-I, the adhesin involved in diffuse adherence of the diarrhoeagenic

The adherence mechanisms of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to
epithelial cells are still not understood. To study the molecular basis of the
diffuse adherence (DA) phenotype exhibited by diarrhoeagenic E. coli expressing
classical EPEC serotypes we investigated strain 2787 (O126:H27) isolated from a
case of infantile diarrhoea. A 6.0 kb plasmid-derived DNA fragment mediates the
DA phenotype and encodes the 100 kDa adhesin protein AIDA-I (adhesin involved in 
diffuse adherence). Sequencing of the entire fragment revealed two open reading
frames which encoded proteins of 45 kDa and 132 kDa, respectively. The 132 kDa
protein has been identified as an AIDA-I precursor protein. After cleavage of the
signal sequence further processing at the C-terminus of the 132 kDa precursor
leads to the mature approximately 100 kDa AIDA-I. While the exact function of the
cytoplasmic 45 kDa protein is not known, preliminary evidence indicates that it
is necessary for the correct maturation of AIDA-I. The AIDA-I precursor exhibits 
significant homology with the virG(icsA) protein of Shigella flexneri which seems
to be involved in the intercellular spread of invasive Shigella organisms.
