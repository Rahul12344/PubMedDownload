Eukaryotic cells sterilize the cytosol by using autophagy to route invading
bacterial pathogens to the lysosome. During macrophage infection with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a vacuolar pathogen, exogenous induction of autophagy
can limit replication, but the mechanism of autophagy targeting and its role in
natural infection remain unclear. Here we show that phagosomal permeabilization
mediated by the bacterial ESX-1 secretion system allows cytosolic components of
the ubiquitin-mediated autophagy pathway access to phagosomal M. tuberculosis.
Recognition of extracelluar bacterial DNA by the STING-dependent cytosolic
pathway is required for marking bacteria with ubiquitin, and delivery of bacilli 
to autophagosomes requires the ubiquitin-autophagy receptors p62 and NDP52 and
the DNA-responsive kinase TBK1. Remarkably, mice with monocytes incapable of
delivering bacilli to the autophagy pathway are extremely susceptible to
infection. Our results reveal an unexpected link between DNA sensing, innate
immunity, and autophagy and indicate a major role for this autophagy pathway in
resistance to M. tuberculosis infection.
