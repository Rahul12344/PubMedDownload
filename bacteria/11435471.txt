Antibody-secreting plasma cells are nonrecirculatory and lodge in splenic red
pulp, lymph node medullary cords, and bone marrow. The factors that regulate
plasma cell localization are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that, compared
with their B cell precursors, plasma cells exhibit increased chemotactic
sensitivity to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12. At the same time, they downregulate CXCR5
and CCR7 and have reduced responsiveness to the B and T zone chemokines CXCL13,
CCL19, and CCL21. We demonstrate that CXCL12 is expressed within splenic red pulp
and lymph node medullary cords as well as in bone marrow. In chimeric mice
reconstituted with CXCR4-deficient fetal liver cells, plasma cells are
mislocalized in the spleen, found in elevated numbers in blood, and fail to
accumulate normally in the bone marrow. Our findings indicate that as B cells
differentiate into plasma cells they undergo a coordinated change in chemokine
responsiveness that regulates their movements in secondary lymphoid organs and
promotes lodgment within the bone marrow.
