The composition of autologous blood grafts after cryopreservation,
post-transplant hematological recovery up to 1 year and immune recovery up to 6
months as well as outcome was analyzed in 87 patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
The patients receiving added plerixafor due to poor mobilization (11%) were
compared to those mobilized with G-CSF or cyclophosphamide (CY) plus G-CSF. The
use of plerixafor was found to significantly affect the graft composition as
there was a significantly higher proportion of the more primitive CD34+ cells,
higher number of T and B lymphocytes as well as NK cells in the grafts of
patients who received also plerixafor. The hematological recovery after auto-SCT 
was comparable between the groups. The recovery of CD3+CD4+ T cells was faster in
plerixafor mobilized patients at 1 and 3 months post-transplant. There were no
significant differences in progression-free (PFS) or overall survival (OS)
according to the plerixafor use.
