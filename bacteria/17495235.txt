OBJECTIVE: Two types of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), early EPCs and late 
EPCs (also called endothelial outgrowth cells [EOCs]), were described in vitro
previously. In this report, we dissect the phenotype of the precursor(s) that
generate these cell types with focus on the markers CD34, CD133, and vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) that have been used to identify
putative circulating endothelial precursors. We also included CD45 in the
analysis to assess the relation between CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (HPC),
CD34+ endothelial precursors, and both in vitro generated EPC types. Addressing
this issue might lead to a better understanding of the lineage and phenotype of
the precursor(s) that give rise to both cell types in vitro and may contribute to
a consensus on their flowcytometric enumeration.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using cell sorting of human cord blood (UCB) and bone marrow
(BM) cells, we demonstrate that EOC generating precursors are confined to a small
CD34+ CD45- cell fraction, but not to the CD34+ CD45+ HPC fraction, nor any other
CD45+ subpopulation. CD34+ CD45+ HPC generated monocytic cells that displayed
characteristics typical for early EPCs. Phenotypic analysis showed that EOC
generating CD34+ CD45- cells express VEGFR2 but not CD133, whereas CD34+ CD45+
HPC express CD133 as expected, but not VEGFR2.
CONCLUSION: EOCs are not derived from CD133+ cells or CD45+ hematopoietic
precursors.
