BACKGROUND: The hydrophobic nature of hydrocarbons make them less bioavailable to
microbes, generally leading to low efficiency in biodegradation. Current
bioremediation strategies for hydrocarbon contamination, uses induced mixed
microbial cultures. This in-vitro study demonstrates the utilization of naturally
occurring communities in suitable habitats for achieving highly efficient,
synergistic degradation of hydrocarbons in a simple community structure without
additives.
METHODS: Enrichment media supplemented with 1% (7652.53 mg/L) hexadecane (HXD) as
the sole carbon source were inoculated with samples of soil with waste polythene,
collected from a municipal landfill in order to isolate microbial communities.
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on HXD grown 
co-cultures and individual counterparts after 14 days incubation and percentage
degradation was calculated. Microbes were identified using 16S rRNA gene and
Internal Transcribed Spacer region sequencing. Biofilm formation was confirmed
through scanning electron microscopy, in the most efficient community.
RESULTS: Three mixed communities (C1, C2 and C3) that demonstrated efficient
visual disintegration of the HXD layer in the static liquid cultures were
isolated. The C1 community showed the highest activity, degrading > 99% HXD
within 14 days. C1 comprised of a single fungus and a bacterium and they were
identified as a Bacillus sp. MM1 and an Apsergillus sp. MM1. The co-culture and
individual counterparts of the C1 community were assayed for HXD degradation by
GC-MS. Degradation by the fungal and bacterial monocultures were 52.92 ± 8.81%
and 9.62 ± 0.71% respectively, compared to 99.42 ± 0.38% by the co-culture in
14 days. This proved the synergistic behavior of the community. Further, this
community demonstrated the formation of a biofilm in oil-water interface in the
liquid medium. This was evidenced from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showing
the Bacillus cells attached on to Aspergillus mycelia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utilization of naturally formed
fungal-bacterial communities for enhanced biodegradation of hydrocarbons such as 
hexadecane and reports for the first time, synergistic degradation of hexadecane 
through biofilm formation, by a community comprising of Bacillus cereus group and
Aspergillus flavus complex.
