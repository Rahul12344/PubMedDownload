CD1d-dependent natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique T-cell subset with the
ability to regulate the immune system in response to a broad range of diseases.
That low NKT-cell numbers are associated with many different disease states in
mice and humans, combined with the fact that NKT-cell numbers vary widely between
individuals, makes it crucial to understand how these cells develop and how their
numbers are maintained. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of
NKT-cell development and attempt to highlight the most important questions in
this field.
