Interleukin-36 (IL-36) cytokines are important regulators of mucosal homeostasis 
and inflammation. We have previously established that oral epithelial cells
upregulate IL-36γ expression in response to the bacterial pathogen Porphyromonas 
gingivalis Here, we have established that IL-36γ can stimulate the gene
expression of mechanistically distinct antimicrobial proteins, including the
peptidoglycan amidase PGLYRP2, in oral epithelial cells (e.g., TIGK cells).
PGLYRP2 gene expression was not stimulated by either IL-17 or IL-22, thus
demonstrating selectivity in the regulation of PGLYRP2 by IL-36γ. The
IL-36γ-inducible expression of PGLYRP2 was shown to be mediated by IRAK1- and p38
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent signaling. Furthermore, our
finding that IL-36γ-inducible PGLYRP2 expression was reduced in proliferating
TIGK cells but increased in terminally differentiating cells suggests that
control of PGLYRP2 expression is associated with the maturation of the oral
epithelium. PGLYRP2 expression in TIGK cells can also be directly stimulated by
oral bacteria. However, the extracellular gingipain proteases (Kgp and RgpA/B)
produced by P. gingivalis, which are critical virulence factors, can antagonize
PGLYRP2 expression. Thus, the expression of IL-36γ by oral epithelial cells in
response to P. gingivalis might enable the subsequent autocrine stimulation of
PGLYRP2 expression. In summary, our data identify how IL-36γ may promote oral
mucosal homeostasis by regulating PGLYRP2 expression.
