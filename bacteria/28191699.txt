Impairment of epithelial barrier integrity caused by environmental triggers is
associated with the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. Using human airway
epithelial cells, we attempted to identify molecule(s) that promote airway
epithelial barrier integrity. Microarray analyses were conducted using the
Affimetrix human whole genome gene chip, and we identified the N-myc
downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) gene, which was induced during the
development of the epithelial cell barrier. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed
strong NDRG1 expression in ciliated epithelial cells in nasal tissues sampled
from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and the low expression of NDRG1 
was observed in goblet cells or damaged epithelial cells. NDRG1 gene knockdown
with its specific siRNA decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance and
increased the dextran permeability. Immunocytochemistry revealed that NDRG1
knockdown disrupted tight junctions of airway epithelial cells. Next, we analyzed
the effects of NDRG1 knockdown on the expression of tight and adhesion junction
molecules. NDRG1 knockdown significantly decreased only claudin-9 expression, but
did not decrease other claudin family molecules, such as E-cadherin, and ZO-1,
-2, or -3. Knockdown of claudin-9 markedly impaired the barrier function in
airway epithelial cells. These results suggest that NDRG1 is important for the
barrier integrity in airway epithelial cells.
