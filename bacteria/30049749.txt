PURPOSE: Blocking the function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) is an
attractive approach for cancer immunotherapy. Having shown DC-HIL/GPNMB to be the
T-cell-inhibitory receptor mediating the suppressor function of MDSCs, we
evaluated the potential of anti-DC-HIL mAb as an MDSC-targeting cancer treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with metastatic cancer (n = 198) were analyzed by
flow cytometry for DC-HIL or PDL1 expression on blood CD14+HLA-DRno/lo MDSCs.
Their suppressor function was assessed by in vitro coculture with autologous T
cells, and the ability of anti-DC-HIL or anti-PDL1 mAb to reverse such function
was determined. Tumor expression of these receptors was examined histologically, 
and the antitumor activity of the mAb was evaluated by attenuated growth of colon
cancers in mice.
RESULTS: Patients with metastatic cancer had high blood levels of DC-HIL+ MDSCs
compared with healthy controls. Anti-DC-HIL mAb reversed the in vitro function in
∼80% of cancer patients tested, particularly for colon cancer. Despite very low
expression on blood MDSCs, anti-PDL1 mAb was as effective as anti-DC-HIL mAb in
reversing MDSC function, a paradoxical phenomenon we found to be due to
upregulated expression of PDL1 by T-cell-derived IFNγ in cocultures. DC-HIL is
not expressed by colorectal cancer cells but by CD14+ cells infiltrating the
tumor. Finally, anti-DC-HIL mAb attenuated growth of preestablished colon tumors 
by reducing MDSCs and increasing IFNγ-secreting T cells in the tumor
microenvironment, with similar outcomes to anti-PDL1 mAb.
CONCLUSIONS: Blocking DC-HIL function is a potentially useful treatment for at
least colorectal cancer with high blood levels of DC-HIL+ MDSCs.See related
