Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP) facilitates the transfer of LPS of
Gram-negative bacteria to the pattern recognition receptor CD14, resulting in
activation of immunocompetent cells. LBP can also facilitate the binding of
lipoarabinomannan, a major cell wall component of mycobacteria, to immune cells. 
To determine the role of LBP in the immune response to pulmonary Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection, LBP gene-deficient (-/-) and normal wild-type (WT) mice
were intranasally infected with M. tuberculosis. LBP-/- mice displayed a similar 
survival and mycobacterial outgrowth in lungs and liver, although they
demonstrated a reduced lymphocyte recruitment and activation during the early
stages of infection. The clearance of pulmonary infection with the non-pathogenic
M. smegmatis was also unaltered in LBP-/- mice. These data suggest that LBP does 
not contribute to an effective host response in M. tuberculosis infection.
