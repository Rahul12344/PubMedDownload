Thirty-two Israeli Jewish schizophrenic patients were typed for Class I (HLA-A,
B, C) and Class II (HLA-DR) antigens. A significant increase of HLA-A2 (P = 0.01)
and A23 (P = 0.02) was found. None of the 10 HLA-DR antigens tested was
associated with the disease. Study of eight families indicated that close linkage
of the gene responsible for this disorder to the HLA system is unlikely.
