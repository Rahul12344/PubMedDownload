A new class of heterocycles, specifically substituted pyrazolo-, isoxazolo- and
pyrimidocyclohepta[b]indoles, has been prepared by condensation of substituted
7-(hydroxymethylene)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrocyclohepta[b]indol-6(5H)-ones with
hydrazine hydrate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, phenylhydrazine, urea and
thiourea, respectively. The structures of the compounds were established by IR,
(1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, mass spectral analysis, X-ray diffraction, and the compounds
have been screened for in vitro antimicrobial and antimycobacterial against
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB). Among the compounds screened, five
substances were found to have an MIC of 3.12 μg/ml or greater against MTB.
Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses and in silico drug relevant
properties (HBD, HBA, PSA, c Log P, M.wt) confirmed that the compounds are
potential lead compounds for future drug discovery studies.
