Chemokines play diverse roles in human pathophysiology, ranging from trafficking 
leukocytes and immunosurveillance to the regulation of metabolism and neural
function. Chemokine function is intimately coupled to binding tissue
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and
dermatan sulfate (DS). Currently, very little is known about how the structural
features and sequences of a given chemokine, the structure and sulfation pattern 
of a given GAG, and structural differences among GAGs and among chemokines impact
binding interactions. In this study, we used solution NMR spectroscopy to
characterize the binding interactions of two related neutrophil-activating
chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL5, with HS, CS, and DS. For both chemokines, the dimer 
bound all three GAGs with higher affinity than did the monomer, and affinities of
the chemokines for CS and DS were lower than for HS. NMR-based structural models 
reveal diverse binding geometries and show that the binding surfaces for each of 
the three GAGs were different between the two chemokines. However, a given
chemokine had similar binding interactions with CS and DS that were different
from HS. Considering the fact that CXCL1 and CXCL5 activate the same CXCR2
receptor, we conclude that GAG interactions play a role in determining the nature
of chemokine gradients, levels of free chemokine available for receptor
activation, how chemokines bind their receptors, and that differences in these
interactions determine chemokine-specific function.
