Regulation of T cell-mediated immunity in the lungs is critical for prevention of
immune-related lung disorders and for host protection from pathogens. While the
prevalent view of pulmonary T cell responses is based on peptide recognition by
antigen receptors, called T cell receptors (TCR), on the T cell surface in the
context of classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, novel
pathways involving the presentation of lipid antigens by cluster of
differentiation 1 (CD1) molecules to lipid-reactive T cells are emerging as key
players in pulmonary immune system. Whereas, genetic conservation of group II CD1
(CD1d) in mouse and human genomes facilitated numerous in vivo studies of
CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung diseases, the
recent development of human CD1-transgenic mice has made it possible to examine
the physiological roles of group I CD1 (CD1a-c) molecules in lung immunity. Here,
we discuss current understanding of the biology of CD1-reactive T cells with a
specific focus on their roles in several pulmonary disorders.
