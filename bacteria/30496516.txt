Uracil arises in DNA by hydrolytic deamination of cytosine (C) and by erroneous
incorporation of deoxyuridine monophosphate opposite adenine, where the former
event is devastating by generation of C → thymine transitions. The base excision 
repair (BER) pathway replaces uracil by the correct base. In human cells two
uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) initiate BER by excising uracil from DNA; one is
hSMUG1 (human single-strand-selective mono-functional UDG). We report that repair
initiation by hSMUG1 involves strand incision at the uracil site resulting in a
3'-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde designated uracil-DNA incision product (UIP), and a
5'-phosphate. UIP is removed from the 3'-end by human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) 
endonuclease 1 preparing for single-nucleotide insertion. hSMUG1 also incises DNA
or processes UIP to a 3'-phosphate designated uracil-DNA processing product
(UPP). UIP and UPP were indirectly identified and quantified by polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and chemically characterised by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass-spectrometric analysis of DNA from
enzyme reactions using 18O- or 16O-water. The formation of UIP accords with an
elimination (E2) reaction where deprotonation of C2' occurs via the formation of 
a C1' enolate intermediate. A three-phase kinetic model explains rapid uracil
excision in phase 1, slow unspecific enzyme adsorption/desorption to DNA in phase
2 and enzyme-dependent AP site incision in phase 3.
