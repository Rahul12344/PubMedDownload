Effective laboratory animal models of bacterial meningitis are needed to unravel 
the pathophysiology of this disease. Previous models have failed to simulate
human meningitis by using a directly intracerebral route of infection.
Hyaluronidase is a virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this study, a
novel model of murine meningitis is described. Intranasal administration of S.
pneumoniae with hyaluronidase induced meningitis in 50% of inoculated mice, as
defined by a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and an inflammatory
infiltrate in the meninges. None of the mice inoculated without hyaluronidase
developed meningitis. Hyaluronidase was found to facilitate pneumococcal invasion
of the bloodstream after colonization of the upper respiratory tract. Meningitis 
was characterized by pleocytosis of CSF and the induction of proinflammatory
cytokines and CXC chemokines in brain tissue. These results indicate that this
murine model mimics important features of human disease and allow for the use of 
this model for studying issues related to the pathophysiology and the treatment
of pneumococcal meningitis.
