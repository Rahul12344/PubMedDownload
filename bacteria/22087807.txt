BACKGROUND: We previously reported that chronic periodontal inflammation causes
the accumulation of the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
(HIF-1α) in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in vivo. Here, evidence is provided
that bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and cellular hypoxia, both associated
with periodontitis, can individually, or in combination, lead to the accumulation
and activation of HIF-1 in HGF in vitro.
METHODS: Primary gingival fibroblasts were cultured from human gingival biopsies.
HIF-1α peptide from HGFs treated with Escherichia coli LPS under normoxia or
hypoxia was detected by nuclear protein extraction, immunoprecipitation,
immunoblotting, and immunocytofluorescence. HIF-1α transcripts were detected
using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The transcript
expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a downstream 
gene of HIF-1α, were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Two HIF-1α splicing transcription variants were found to be
constitutively expressed in HGFs. E. coli LPS induced a dose- and time-dependent 
nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α peptide in HGFs. This accumulation could be
attenuated by treatment with a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-neutralizing antibody.
Under hypoxia, LPS further increased HIF-1α accumulation in HGFs. VEGF-A
transcript expression was upregulated by LPS under both normoxia and hypoxia but 
was downregulated by pretreatment with TLR4-neutralizing antibody or the specific
HIF-1α inhibitor 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole.
CONCLUSION: LPS induces the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α in HGFs and induces
HIF-1 biologic activity under normoxia or hypoxia possibly through TLR4.
