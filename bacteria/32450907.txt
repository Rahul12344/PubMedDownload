BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is one of the most common and serious
causes of healthcare-associated bacteremia. The emergence and dissemination of
multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) PA strains pose a 
major clinical concern. ST235-PA is a high-risk clone which shows a high capacity
to acquire antibiotic resistance. Here we describe the first autochthonous New
Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST235 identified
in Italy.
CASE PRESENTATION: In October 2019, a patient residing in an elderly health care 
and rehabilitation facility, was hospitalized and died from sepsis caused by an
XDR-PA. The strain belonged to the high-risk clone sequence type ST235. Whole
genome sequencing (WGS) revealed the presence of genes encoding NDM-1 and
multiple β-lactamases, many clinically significant multidrug efflux pump
complexes and also the virulence gene ExoU, which is associated with a high
cytotoxic phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Few strains of NDM-1-PA have been identified worldwide, all
belonging to ST235. The combination of ST235 and ExoU is a predictor of highly
unfavorable prognosis. The potential spread of these high-risk clones in
healthcare settings is worrisome because treatment options are limited. Early
identification of high-risk clones could help in outbreaks investigation and
infections control.
