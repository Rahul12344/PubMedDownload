BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a prototype of chronic inflammatory
arthritis termed seronegative spondyloarthropathies that typically affects the
joints. Among the non-Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci, the strongest
association has been observed with Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1)
gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Moreover, the effect of ERAP1 gene
SNPs on the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in AS disease has
still been poorly elucidated. In this study, we aimed to determine the
association of ERAP1 gene SNPs (rs30187 and rs2287987) with AS risk as well as
their effect on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, with emphasis on the immunoregulation of the IL-17/IL-23 pathway, in
an Iranian population.
METHODS: We performed Single specific primer (SSP)-PCR for genotyping of 160 AS
patients and 160 healthy controls. After isolation of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), total RNA of PBMCs was isolated, complementary DNA
(cDNA) was synthesized, and quantitative analyses of mRNA expression of cytokines
were performed by Real-time PCR for 40 HLA-B27 positive AS patients and 40
healthy individuals as controls.
RESULTS: It was seen that T allele of rs30187 (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.07-2.22,
P =  0.017) and C allele of rs2287987 (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.05-2.14, P = 0.024) were
associated with the risk of AS. Both of these alleles were associated more
strongly in the HLA-B27 positive AS patients. There was a significant
overexpression of mRNAs of pro-inflammatory (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23, TNF-α and
IFN-γ), while downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in 
PBMCs from 40 HLA-B27 positive AS patients in comparison to controls. AS patients
with rs30187 SNP TT genotype expressed mRNA of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-23
significantly higher than patents with CT and CC genotypes for this SNP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represented the association of ERAP1 gene rs30187 and
rs2287987 polymorphism with the risk of AS. Additionally, it appears that rs30187
polymorphism may be involved in the immunomodulation of the IL-17/IL-23 pathway
in the AS disease.
