Lactose permease (LacY) of Escherichia coli is not only a paradigm for secondary 
transporters but also for difficulties in two-dimensional (2D) crystallization.
In this work we present the progresses achieved in the observation of 2D crystals
of wild-type LacY by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Crystals were obtained
following reconstitution of LacY in
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes. Proteolipid
sheets (PLSs) 6.4 nm in height were obtained after spreading the samples onto
mica. Observations were carried out in liquid medium and in contact mode
(CM-AFM). When the crystalline surfaces of the PLSs were imaged regular packing
arrangements were observed. The back-Fourier transformation revealed the
existence of various orientations mostly consistent with crystals possessing p2
symmetry and unit-cell dimensions: a=13.15 nm, b=16.74 nm, gamma=116 degrees. The
characteristics, size, and shape of the repetitive motif could be compatible with
dimers of this protein. These preliminary results are compared and discussed with
previously reported 2D crystals observed by electron microscopy.
