The medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHAMCL) synthase genes phaC1 and
phaC2 of Pseudomonas mendocina NK-01 were cloned and inserted into expression
plasmid pBBR1MCS-2 to form pBBR1MCS-C1 and pBBR1MCS-C2 which were expressed
respectively in the PHAMCL-negative strain P. mendocina C7 whose PHAMCL synthesis
operon was defined knock out. P. mendocina C7 derivatives P. mendocina C7C1 and
C7C2 carrying pBBR1MCS-C1 and pBBR1MCS-C2 respectively were constructed.
Fermentation and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed that P. mendocina
C7C1 had higher PHAMCL production rate but its PHAMCL had lower molecular weight 
than that of P. mendocina C7C2. Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis revealed that the two PHAMCL had similarity in monomer composition with 
3HD as the favorite monomer i.e. PhaC1 and PhaC2 had the same substrate
specificity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) also revealed that the two PHAMCL had the same 
physical properties. P. mendocina NK-01was the first reported strain whose PHAMCL
synthases PhaC1 and PhaC2 had the same substrate specificity.
