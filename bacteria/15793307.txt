FtsZ, the prokaryotic homologue of tubulin, is an essential cell division
protein. In the cell, it localizes at the center, forming a ring that constricts 
during division. In vitro, it binds and hydrolyzes GTP and polymerizes in a
GTP-dependent manner. We have used atomic force microscopy to study the structure
and dynamics of FtsZ polymer assembly on a mica surface under buffer solution.
The polymers were highly dynamic and flexible, and they continuously rearranged
over the surface. End-to-end joining of filaments and depolymerization from
internal zones were observed, suggesting that fragmentation and reannealing may
contribute significantly to the dynamics of FtsZ assembly. The shape evolution of
the restructured polymers manifested a strong inherent tendency to curve.
Polymers formed in the presence of non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogues or in
the presence of GDP and AlF(3) were structurally similar but showed a slower
dynamic behavior. These results provide experimental evidence supporting the
model of single-strand polymerization plus cyclization recently proposed to
explain the hydrodynamic behavior of the polymers in solution.
