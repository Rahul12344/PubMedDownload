Background/aim: Tinnitus is seen in 15% of the general population; in 1%–6% of
this number, the quality of life is seriously affected by this chronic condition.
Chemical, oxidative, and emotional stressors are important in terms of the
clinical course of tinnitus. Apelin is an endogenous peptide which is an
oxidative stress mediator. It has been shown that the apelin/APJ (apelin junction
receptor) system plays various roles in the physiology and pathophysiology of
many organs. However, the role of the apelin/APJ system as an oxidative stress
mediator in tinnitus is unknown. We investigated the level of apelin in patients 
with normal hearing and bilateral tinnitus.
Materials and methods: We enrolled patients diagnosed with bilateral idiopathic
tinnitus. Tinnitus severity was determined using the tinnitus handicap inventory 
(THI). We recorded the levels of plasma apelin-13 and biochemical parameters.
Results: The mean apelin level of the control group was higher than that of the
patient group (P = 0.002). A significant negative correlation was evident between
the apelin level and the THI (r = –0.460, P = 0.003). The triglyceride (TG) level
was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (P <
0.001).
Conclusion: In our study, we found a negative correlation between apelin and
tinnitus severity. Thus, apelin may play a role in the pathophysiology of
idiopathic tinnitus, and may be prescribed during follow-up to reduce oxidative
stress in the future. Further clinical studies on the effects of the apelin/APJ
(apelin junction receptor) system and the effects of antioxidants in patients
with inflammatory diseases are required.
