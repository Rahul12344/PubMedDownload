Autophagy plays an essential role in the defense against many microbial pathogens
as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity. Some pathogens have evolved 
sophisticated mechanisms that promote their ability to evade or subvert host
autophagy. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of autophagy modulation mediated
by the recently discovered Vibrio cholerae cytotoxin, motility-associated killing
factor A (MakA). pH-dependent endocytosis of MakA by host cells resulted in the
formation of a cholesterol-rich endolysosomal membrane aggregate in the
perinuclear region. Aggregate formation induced the noncanonical autophagy
pathway driving unconventional LC3 (herein referring to MAP1LC3B) lipidation on
endolysosomal membranes. Subsequent sequestration of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1
E3-like enzyme complex, required for LC3 lipidation at the membranous aggregate, 
resulted in an inhibition of both canonical autophagy and autophagy-related
processes, including the unconventional secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β).
These findings identify a novel mechanism of host autophagy modulation and immune
modulation employed by V. cholerae during bacterial infection.
