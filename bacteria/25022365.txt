Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to
mount innate immune responses. The TLR4-induced release of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines generates robust inflammatory responses, which must
then be restrained to avoid disease. New mechanisms for the critical regulation
of TLR-induced cytokine responses are still emerging. Here we find TLR4 complexes
localized in LPS-induced dorsal ruffles on the surface of macrophages. We
discover that the small GTPase Rab8a is enriched in these ruffles and recruits
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kγ) as an effector by interacting directly
through its Ras-binding domain. Rab8a and PI3Kγ function to regulate Akt
signalling generated by surface TLR4. Rab8a and PI3Kγ do not affect TLR4
endocytosis, but instead regulate mammalian target of rapamycin signalling as a
mechanism for biasing the cytokine profile to constrain inflammation in innate
immunity.
