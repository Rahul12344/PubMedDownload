BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are considered to play key roles in 
tissue destruction during periodontitis. In this study, we evaluated the
cytotoxicity of hydroxamic acid-based MMP inhibitors (ONO-4817, ONO-MI1-514, and 
ONO-MI1-570), and their inhibitory effects on MMP-2 and -9 activities and growth 
of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and human gingival epithelial cells
(HGE) were incubated with test inhibitors prior to investigating cell viability, 
cell proliferation, and mRNA expression for MMP-2 and -9. Gelatin zymography and 
a colorimetric MMP assay were performed to study the inhibitory effects on MMP-2 
and -9 activities derived from HGF and HGE, respectively. The effect of MMP
inhibitors on keratinocyte migration and P. gingivalis growth was also tested.
RESULTS: Cell viability was not affected by any of the inhibitors at a final
concentration of 50 microM, nor was cell proliferation at 20 microM. All
inhibitors clearly inhibited MMP-2 produced by HGF and MMP-9 produced by HGE in a
dose-dependent manner. No change was found in mRNA expression of MMPs by gingival
cells treated with the inhibitors. ONO-4817 and ONO-MI1-514 inhibited
keratinocyte migration. ONO-4817 showed a slightly inhibitory effect on the
growth of P. gingivalis.
CONCLUSION: Data obtained in this study support the potential use of the three
MMP inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease.
