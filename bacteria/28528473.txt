Streptomyces albus J1074 is one of the most popular and convenient hosts for
heterologous expression of gene clusters directing the biosynthesis of various
natural metabolic products, such as antibiotics. This fuels interest in
elucidation of genetic mechanisms that may limit secondary metabolism in J1074.
Here, we report the generation and initial study of J1074 mutant, deficient in
gene bldA for tRNALeuUAA, the only tRNA capable of decoding rare leucyl TTA codon
in Streptomyces. The bldA deletion in J1074 resulted in a highly conditional Bld 
phenotype, with depleted formation of aerial hyphae on certain solid media. In
addition, bldA mutant of J1074 was unable to produce endogenous antibacterial
compounds and two heterologous antibiotics, moenomycin and aranciamycin, whose
biosynthesis is directed by TTA-containing genes. We have employed a new TTA
codon-specific Î²-galactosidase reporter system to provide genetic evidence that
J1074 bldA mutant is impaired in translation of TTA. In addition, we have
discussed the possible reasons for differences in the phenotypes of bldA mutants 
described here and in previous studies, providing knowledge to study bldA-based
regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis.
