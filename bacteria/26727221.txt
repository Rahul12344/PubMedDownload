Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) regulates the sequential activation of
caspase-2 and caspase-8 before mitochondrial apoptosis. Here, we report the
regulation of Mcl-1 destabilization and cathepsin D-regulated caspase-8
activation by GSK-3β and caspase-2. Treatment with either the ceramide analogue
C2-ceramide or the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide sequentially induced
lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), the reduction of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential, and apoptosis. Following LMP, cathepsin D translocated
from lysosomes to the cytoplasm, whereas inhibiting cathepsin D blocked
mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, cathepsin D caused the activation of
caspase-8 but not caspase-2. Inhibiting GSK-3β and caspase-2 blocked Mcl-1
destabilization, LMP, cathepsin D re-localization, caspase-8 activation, and
mitochondrial apoptosis. Expression of Mcl-1 was localized to the lysosomes, and 
forced expression of Mcl-1 prevented apoptotic signaling via the
lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway. These results demonstrate the importance of
GSK-3β and caspase-2 in ceramide- and etoposide-induced apoptosis through
mechanisms involving Mcl-1 destabilization and the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis.
