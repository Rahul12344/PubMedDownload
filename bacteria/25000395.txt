A 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) degrading bacterium strain 
IITR03 producing trehalolipid was isolated and characterized from a pesticides
contaminated soil. The strain IITR03 was identified as a member of the genus
Rhodococcus based on polyphasic studies. Under aqueous culture conditions, the
strain IITR03 degraded 282 μM of DDT and could also utilize 10mM concentration
each of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-chlorobenzoic acid and benzoic acid as sole
carbon and energy source. The catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme activity resulted
in conversion of catechol to form cis,cis-muconic acid. Cloning and sequencing of
partial nucleotide sequence of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene (cat) from strain
IITR03 revealed its similarity to catA gene present in Rhodococcus sp. strain
Lin-2 (97% identity) and Rhodococcus strain AN22 (96% identity) degrading
benzoate and aniline, respectively. The results suggest that the strain IITR03
could be useful for field bioremediation studies of DDT-residues and chlorinated 
aromatic compounds present in contaminated sites.
