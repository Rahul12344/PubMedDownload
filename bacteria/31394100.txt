G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) typically have an amphipathic helix ("helix
8") immediately C-terminal to the transmembrane helical bundle. To date, a number
of functional roles have been associated with GPCR helix 8 segments, but
structure-function analysis for this region remains limited. Here, we examine
helix 8 of the apelin receptor (AR or APJ), a class A GPCR with wide
physiological and pathophysiological relevance. The 71 residue C-terminal tail of
the AR is primarily intrinsically disordered, with a detergent micelle-induced
increase in helical character. This helicity was localized to the helix 8 region,
in good agreement with the recent AR crystal structure. A series of helix 8
mutants were made to reduce helicity, remove amphipathy, or flip the hydrophobic 
and hydrophilic faces. Each mutant AR was tested both biophysically, in the
isolated C-terminal tail, and functionally in HEK 293 T cells, for full-length
AR. In all instances, micelle interactions were maintained, and steady-state AR
expression was efficient. However, removal of amphipathy or helical character led
to a significant decrease in cell surface localization. Flipping of helix 8
amphipathic topology restored cell surface localization to some degree, but still
was significantly reduced relative to wild-type. Structural integrity, amphipathy
to drive membrane association, and correct topology of helix 8 membrane
association all thus appear important for cell surface localization of the AR.
This behavior correlates well to GPCR C-terminal tail sequence motifs, implying
that these serve to specify key topological features of helix 8 and its proximity
to the transmembrane domain.
