OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate: (1) the
antibacterial activity of two antibacterial monomers, dimethylaminododecyl
methacrylate (DMADDM) and dimethylammoniumethyl dimethacrylate (DMAEDM), against 
eight different species of oral pathogens for the first time; (2) the
cytotoxicity of DMAEDM and DMADDM.
METHODS: DMAEDM and DMADDM were synthesized by reacting a tertiary amine group
with an organo-halide. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum
bactericidal concentration (MBC) against eight species of bacteria were tested.
Time-kill determinations were performed to examine the bactericidal kinetics.
Cytotoxicity of monomers on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was assessed using a
methyl thiazolyltetrazolium assay and live/dead viability assay.
RESULTS: DMADDM showed strong bactericidal activity against all bacteria, with
MIC of 1.2-9.8μg/mL. DMAEDM had MIC of 20-80mg/mL. Time-kill determinations
indicated that DMADDM and DMAEDM had rapid killing effects against eight species 
of bacteria, and eliminated all bacteria in 30min at the concentration of 4-fold 
MBC. Median lethal concentration for DMADDM and DMAEDM was between 20 and
40μg/mL, which was 20-fold higher than 1-2μg/mL for BisGMA control.
CONCLUSIONS: DMAEDM and DMADDM were tested in time-kill assay against eight
species of oral bacteria for the first time. Both were effective in
bacteria-inhibition, but DMADDM had a higher potency than DMAEDM. Different
killing efficacy was found against different bacteria species. DMAEDM and DMADDM 
had much lower cytotoxicity than BisGMA. Therefore, DMADDM and DMAEDM are
promising for use in bonding agents and other restorative/preventive materials to
combat a variety of oral pathogens.
