The pre-epithelial mucus layer (PML) and epithelial mucins were studied by mucin 
histochemistry in 10 microns-thick celloidinstabilized cryostat sections in the
proximal and distal colon of conventional and germ-free rats aged 120 and 350
days. No continuous PML was found in the proximal colon. A continuous mucus
blanket, of fairly homogenous thickness, was observed in the distal colon, where 
the PML-thickness was 40 +/- 24 microns at 120 days of age and 44 +/- 22 microns 
at 350 days of age in conventional rats, and 25 +/- 17 microns (120 days) and 22 
+/- 10 microns (350 days) in germ-free rats. The stainability of the PML by
periodic acid-Schiff and Alcian Blue at pH 2.5 and 1.0 was stronger in
conventional rats than in germ-free rats, indicating higher concentrations of
mucosubstances and of acid and sulphated mucins, respectively. The PML of the
conventional rat distal colon showed a stratified structure of up to eight
sublayers. In the distal colon of germ-free rats, the whole gut wall thickness
was reduced 47% compared to the conventional rat (germ-free; 185 +/- 73 microns, 
conventional: 350 +/- 115 microns). No stratification of the PML was observed.
The presence of intestinal microflora obviously had a strong influence on the
thickness, compactness, mucin content, mucin composition and structure of the
pre-epithelial mucus layer.
