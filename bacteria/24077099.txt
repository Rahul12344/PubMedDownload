Glycolysis, or its variations, is a fundamental metabolic pathway in life that
functions in almost all organisms to decompose external or intracellular sugars. 
The pathway involves the partial oxidation and splitting of sugars to pyruvate,
which in turn is decarboxylated to produce acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for various
biosynthetic purposes. The decarboxylation of pyruvate loses a carbon equivalent,
and limits the theoretical carbon yield to only two moles of two-carbon (C2)
metabolites per mole of hexose. This native route is a major source of carbon
loss in biorefining and microbial carbon metabolism. Here we design and construct
a non-oxidative, cyclic pathway that allows the production of stoichiometric
amounts of C2 metabolites from hexose, pentose and triose phosphates without
carbon loss. We tested this pathway, termed non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG), in
vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli. NOG enables complete carbon conservation
in sugar catabolism to acetyl-CoA, and can be used in conjunction with CO2
fixation and other one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways to achieve a 100% carbon
yield to desirable fuels and chemicals.
