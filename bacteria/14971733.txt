The medical, veterinary and economic importance of blackflies in South Africa,
and the historical development of blackfly control programmes in various South
African rivers, are reviewed in this paper. In 1996 it was estimated that
blackflies can cause more than R 88 million damages per annum along the middle
and lower Orange River where Simulium chutteri is considered the main pest
species. A clear link between the construction of dams and the spread of the
blackfly problem was shown. Four phases characterize the development of blackfly 
control in South Africa: (1) during the 1960s blackflies in the Vaal River were
controlled with DDT; (2), during the 1970s and into the 1980s blackflies were
controlled using water-flow manipulation; (3) when used at strategic times,
water-flow manipulation could be used to enhance the effect of natural predator
populations; and (4) during the 1990s the organophosphate temephos and toxins
produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis were tested for
their efficacy against blackflies. The larvicides temephos and B. thuringiensis
proved to be effective and are still used in several control programmes. The
latest research focuses on the factors that influence adult blackfly survival and
annoyance, as well as the development of methods that can be used to protect
sheep from blackfly attacks.
