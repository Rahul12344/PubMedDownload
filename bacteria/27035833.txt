BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has shown that methionine- and
choline-deficient high fat (MCD+HF) diet induces the development of nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in which elevated reactive oxygen species play a
crucial role. We have reported that peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4), a unique secretory
member of the PRDX antioxidant family, protects against NAFLD progression.
However, the detailed mechanism and potential effects on the intestinal function 
still remain unclear.
METHODS & RESULTS: Two weeks after feeding mice a MCD+HF diet, the livers of
human PRDX4 transgenic (Tg) mice exhibited significant suppression in the
development of NAFLD compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The serum thiobarbituric 
acid reactive substances levels were significantly lower in Tg mice. In contrast,
the Tg small intestine with PRDX4 overexpression showed more suppressed
shortening of total length and villi height, and more accumulation of lipid in
the jejunum, along with lower levels of dihydroethidium binding. The enterocytes 
exhibited fewer apoptotic but more proliferating cells, and inflammation was
reduced in the mucosa. Furthermore, the small intestine of Tg mice had
significantly higher expression of cholesterol absorption-regulatory factors,
including liver X receptor-Î±, but lower expression of microsomal
triglyceride-transfer protein.
CONCLUSION: Our present data provide the first evidence of the beneficial effects
of PRDX4 on intestinal function in the reduction of the severity of NAFLD, by
ameliorating oxidative stress-induced local and systemic injury. We can suggest
that both liver and intestine are spared, to some degree, by the antioxidant
properties of PRDX4.
