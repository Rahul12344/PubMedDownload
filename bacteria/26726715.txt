Nocardia has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen, especially in organ 
transplant recipients. Heart transplant (HT) recipients initially had an
especially high rate of Nocardia infection, but this could be reduced by the
routine use of cyclosporine. Our objective was to clarify the prevalence and
presentation of Nocardiosis in HT recipients in a retrospective cross-sectional
analysis.
