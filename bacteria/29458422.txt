BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a substantial global burden
for human health, potentially fuelled by migration waves: in 2015, 476,649
refugees applied for asylum in Germany mostly as a result of the Syrian crisis.
In Arabic countries, multiresistant bacteria cause significant problems for
healthcare systems. Currently, no data exist describing antibiotic resistances in
healthy refugees. Here, we assess the microbial landscape and presence of
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in refugees and German controls. To achieve
this, a systematic study was conducted in 500 consecutive refugees, mainly from
Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan and 100 German controls. Stool samples were
subjected to PCR-based quantification of 42 most relevant ARGs, 16S ribosomal RNA
gene sequencing-based microbiota analysis, and culture-based validation of
multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
RESULTS: The fecal microbiota of refugees is substantially different from that of
resident Germans. Three categories of resistance profiles were found: (i) ARGs
independent of geographic origin of individuals comprising BIL/LAT/CMA, ErmB, and
mefE; (ii) vanB with a high prevalence in Germany; and (iii) ARGs showing
substantially increased prevalences in refugees comprising CTX-M group 1, SHV,
vanC1, OXA-1, and QnrB. The majority of refugees carried five or more ARGs while 
the majority of German controls carried three or less ARGs, although the observed
ARGs occurred independent of signatures of potential pathogens.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results, for the first time, assess antibiotic resistance genes 
in refugees and demonstrate a substantially increased prevalence for most
resistances compared to German controls. The antibiotic resistome in refugees may
thus require particular attention in the healthcare system of host countries.
