PURPOSE: Sepsis is the most frequent cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The
"Acute Disease Quality Initiative Workgroup" recently proposed new definitions
for AKI, classifying it as transient or persistent. We investigated the
incidence, mortality, and host response aberrations associated with transient and
persistent AKI in sepsis patients.
METHODS: A total of 1545 patients admitted with sepsis to 2 intensive care units 
in the Netherlands were stratified according to the presence (defined by any
urine or creatinine RIFLE criterion within the first 48 h) and evolution of AKI
(with persistent defined as remaining > 48 h). We determined 30-day mortality by 
logistic regression adjusting for confounding variables and analyzed 16 plasma
biomarkers reflecting pathways involved in sepsis pathogenesis (n = 866) and
blood leukocyte transcriptomes (n = 392).
RESULTS: AKI occurred in 37.7% of patients, of which 18.4% was transient and
81.6% persistent. On admission, patients with persistent AKI had higher disease
severity scores and more frequently had severe (injury or failure) RIFLE AKI
stages than transient AKI patients. Persistent AKI, but not transient AKI, was
associated with increased mortality by day 30 and up to 1 year. Persistent AKI
was associated with enhanced and sustained inflammatory and procoagulant
responses during the first 4 days, and a more severe loss of vascular integrity
compared with transient AKI. Baseline blood gene expression showed minimal
differences with respect to the presence or evolution of AKI.
CONCLUSION: Persistent AKI is independently associated with sepsis mortality, as 
well as with sustained inflammatory and procoagulant responses, and loss of
vascular integrity as compared with transient AKI.
