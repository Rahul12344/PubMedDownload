We evaluated the expression of over 900 AU-rich element (ARE)-containing
transcripts in primary human T lymphocytes following stimulation with anti-CD3
and anti-CD28 antibodies and found that approximately 48% of these transcripts
were regulated following T cell activation. We identified approximately 145
ARE-containing transcripts that were rapidly induced and then rapidly disappeared
within 1 h after activation. Another 250 ARE-containing transcripts expressed in 
resting T cells were rapidly turned off within 30 min after activation. The rates
of transcript disappearance correlated well with rapid mRNA decay measured
following transcriptional arrest with actinomycin D. We identified a subset of
ARE-containing transcripts that were rapidly induced following T cell activation 
that were also induced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation of THP-1
monocytes, and these transcripts exhibited rapid decay in both cell types. Our
results suggest that ARE-mediated mRNA decay plays an important role in the
precisely coordinated down-regulation of gene expression following immune cell
activation.
