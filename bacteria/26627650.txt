S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) is involved in the enzymatic
regulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methylation reactions.
After methyl-group transfer from SAM, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) is formed
as a byproduct, which in turn is hydrolyzed to adenosine (Ado) and homocysteine
(Hcy) by SAHase. The crystal structure of BeSAHase, an SAHase from Bradyrhizobium
elkanii, which is a nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbiont of legume plants, was
determined at 1.7 Å resolution, showing the domain organization
(substrate-binding domain, NAD(+) cofactor-binding domain and dimerization
domain) of the subunits. The protein crystallized in its biologically relevant
tetrameric form, with three subunits in a closed conformation enforced by complex
formation with the Ado product of the enzymatic reaction. The fourth subunit is
ligand-free and has an open conformation. The BeSAHase structure therefore
provides a unique snapshot of the domain movement of the enzyme induced by the
binding of its natural ligands.
