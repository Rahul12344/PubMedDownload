Among the bewildering variety of neoplasms occurring in the head and neck region,
few are unique to the oral cavity which are quite challenging to diagnose. Due to
the rarity of these tumours, it is the practicing oral pathologists'
accountability to confirm some of these neoplasms with or without special
investigative modalities to rule out the differential diagnosis
histopathologically. One in the group of such tumour prevails haemangiopericytoma
aka. solitary fibrous tumour (HPC/SFT). The management of these tumours is purely
histopathologically driven, since the surgical procedure is dependent on the
histological diagnosis. This neoplasm is histologically very difficult to confirm
as benign or malignant without the use of immunohistochemical markers. We report 
such a rare case of a 54-year-old female patient, histopathologically confirmed
diagnosis of HPC/SFT with CD34 positivity for documentation in the literature.
