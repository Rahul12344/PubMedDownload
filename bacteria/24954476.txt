Cell-targeted therapies (smart drugs), which selectively control cancer cell
progression with limited toxicity to normal cells, have been developed to
effectively treat some cancers. However, many cancers such as metastatic prostate
cancer (PC) have yet to be treated with current smart drug technology. Here, we
describe the thorough preclinical characterization of an RNA aptamer (A9g) that
functions as a smart drug for PC by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Treatment of PC cells with A9g results
in reduced cell migration/invasion in culture and metastatic disease in vivo.
Importantly, A9g is safe in vivo and is not immunogenic in human cells.
Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in mice confirm target specificity
and absence of non-specific on/off-target effects. In conclusion, these studies
provide new and important insights into the role of PSMA in driving
carcinogenesis and demonstrate critical endpoints for the translation of a novel 
RNA smart drug for advanced stage PC.
