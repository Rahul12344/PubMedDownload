Clostridium difficile impairs Paneth cells, driving intestinal inflammation that 
exaggerates colitis. Besides secreting bactericidal products to restrain C.
difficile, Paneth cells act as guardians that constitute a niche for intestinal
epithelial stem cell (IESC) regeneration. However, how IESCs are sustained to
specify Paneth-like cells as their niche remains unclear. Cytokine-JAK-STATs are 
required for IESC regeneration. We investigated how constitutive STAT5 activation
(Ca-pYSTAT5) restricts IESC differentiation towards niche cells to restrain C.
difficile infection. We generated inducible transgenic mice and organoids to
determine the effects of Ca-pYSTAT5-induced IESC lineages on C. difficile
colitis. We found that STAT5 absence reduced Paneth cells and predisposed mice to
C. difficile ileocolitis. In contrast, Ca-pYSTAT5 enhanced Paneth cell lineage
tracing and restricted Lgr5 IESC differentiation towards pYSTAT5+Lgr5-CD24+Lyso+ 
or cKit+ niche cells, which imprinted Lgr5hiKi67+ IESCs. Mechanistically, pYSTAT5
activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling to determine Paneth cell fate. In conclusion,
Ca-pYSTAT5 gradients control niche differentiation. Lack of pYSTAT5 reduces the
niche cells to sustain IESC regeneration and induces C. difficile ileocolitis.
STAT5 may be a transcription factor that regulates Paneth cells to maintain niche
regeneration.
