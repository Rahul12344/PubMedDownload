The treatment of many cancers has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) as a standard-of-care therapeutic. Despite many successes, a large
proportion of patients treated with ICB agents experience immune-related adverse 
events (irAEs) in the form of clinical autoimmunity, ranging from mild to life
threatening, that can limit cancer treatment. A mechanistic understanding of
these irAEs is required to better treat or prevent irAEs and to predict those
patients who are susceptible to irAEs. We propose several mechanisms that may
contribute to the generation of irAEs: (1) preexisting susceptibility to
autoimmunity, (2) aberrant presentation of "self" by the tumor, and (3) loss of
tolerance driven by the tumor or tissue microenvironment.
