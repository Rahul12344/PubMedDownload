Phospholipase D from Streptomyces chromofuscus (PLDSc) is a soluble enzyme known 
to be activated by the phosphatidic acid (PA)-calcium complexes. Despite the vast
body of literature that has accumulated on this enzyme, the exact mechanism of
activation remains poorly understood. In this work, we report the first
observation of PLDSc activity in real time and at nanometer resolution using
atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM images of continuous and patchy
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers were recorded, prior and after
incubation with PLDSc. For continuous bilayers, the enzyme induced important
morphological alterations; holes corresponding to the bilayer thickness were
created, while an additional elevated phase, about 2.5 nm high, was observed.
This bilayer blistering is believed to be due to the production of the negatively
charged lipid PA that would cause localized repulsions between the bilayer and
the underlying mica surface. By contrast, these elevated domains were not seen on
patchy bilayers incubated with the enzyme. Instead, the shapes of DPPC patches
were strongly deformed by enzyme activity and evolved into melted morphologies.
These results point to the importance of lipid packing on PLD activity and
illustrate the potential of AFM for visualizing remodeling enzymatic activities.
