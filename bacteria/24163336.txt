The phase variation (reversible on-off switching) of the type 1 fimbrial adhesin 
of Escherichia coli involves a DNA inversion catalyzed by FimB (switching in
either direction) or FimE (on-to-off switching). Here, we demonstrate that RfaH
activates expression of a FimB-LacZ protein fusion while having a modest
inhibitory effect on a comparable fimB-lacZ operon construct and on a FimE-LacZ
protein fusion, indicating that RfaH selectively controls fimB expression at the 
posttranscriptional level. Further work demonstrates that loss of RfaH enables
small RNA (sRNA) MicA inhibition of fimB expression even in the absence of
exogenous inducing stress. This effect is explained by induction of Ïƒ(E), and
hence MicA, in the absence of RfaH. Additional work confirms that the
procaine-dependent induction of micA requires OmpR, as reported previously (A.
Coornaert et al., Mol. Microbiol. 76:467-479, 2010,
doi:10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07115.x), but also demonstrates that RfaH inhibition
of fimB transcription is enhanced by procaine independently of OmpR. While the
effect of procaine on fimB transcription is shown to be independent of RcsB, it
was found to require SlyA, another known regulator of fimB transcription. These
results demonstrate a complex role for RfaH as a regulator of fimB expression.
