Some cancer patients live many decades after diagnosis while others are not so
fortunate. Understanding why this occurs is a fundamental issue in cancer
research. We hypothesize that among the factors controlling favorable outcome are
a class of genes that we describe as "good oncogenes". These genes have a
paradoxical function in cancer in that they are prognostic markers for favorable 
survival but have strong transforming and tumour-promoting properties. As such,
good oncogenes both promote neoplasia and constrain it. We propose that good
oncogenes enhance outcome probability by allowing early tumor detection,
sensitizing cancer cells to senescence or by attenuating metastatic progression
and tumour self-renewal. We believe that understanding the signaling pathways
regulated by good oncogenes provides mechanistic insight into the biochemical
basis for long-term survival in cancer.
