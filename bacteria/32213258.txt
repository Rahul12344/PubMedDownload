Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is a pandemic clone that is evolving
rapidly with increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Here, we investigated
an outbreak of E. coli ST131 producing extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in 
a long-term care facility (LTCF) in Ireland by combining data from this LTCF
(n=69) with other Irish (n=35) and global (n=690) ST131 genomes to reconstruct
the evolutionary history and understand changes in population structure and
genome architecture over time. This required a combination of short- and
long-read genome sequencing, de novo assembly, read mapping, ESBL gene screening,
plasmid alignment and temporal phylogenetics. We found that Clade C was the most 
prevalent (686 out of 794 isolates, 86 %) of the three major ST131 clades
circulating worldwide (A with fimH41, B with fimH22, C with fimH30), and was
associated with the presence of different ESBL alleles, diverse plasmids and
transposable elements. Clade C was estimated to have emerged in c. 1985 and
subsequently acquired different ESBL gene variants (bla CTX-M-14 vs bla
CTX-M-15). An ISEcp1-mediated transposition of the bla CTX-M-15 gene further
increased the diversity within Clade C. We discovered a local clonal expansion of
a rare C2 lineage (C2_8) with a chromosomal insertion of bla CTX-M-15 at the mppA
gene. This was acquired from an IncFIA plasmid. The C2_8 lineage clonally
expanded in the Irish LTCF from 2006, displacing the existing C1 strain (C1_10), 
highlighting the potential for novel ESBL-producing ST131 with a distinct genetic
profile to cause outbreaks strongly associated with specific healthcare
environments.
