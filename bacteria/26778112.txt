Glucokinase and hexokinase from pathogenic protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi are
potential drug targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy of Chagas' disease. These
glucose kinases phosphorylate d-glucose with co-substrate ATP and yield glucose
6-phosphate and are involved in essential metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis 
and the pentose phosphate pathway. An inhibitor class was conceived that is
selective for T. cruzi glucokinase (TcGlcK) using structure-based drug design
involving glucosamine having a linker from the C2 amino that terminates with a
hydrophobic group either being phenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl, or
dioxobenzo[b]thiophenyl groups. The synthesis and characterization for two of the
four compounds are presented while the other two compounds were commercially
available. Four high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of TcGlcK inhibitor
complexes are reported along with enzyme inhibition constants (Ki) for TcGlcK and
Homo sapiens hexokinase IV (HsHxKIV). These glucosamine analogue inhibitors
include three strongly selective TcGlcK inhibitors and a fourth inhibitor,
benzoyl glucosamine (BENZ-GlcN), which is a similar variant exhibiting a shorter 
linker. Carboxybenzyl glucosamine (CBZ-GlcN) was found to be the strongest
glucokinase inhibitor known to date, having a Ki of 0.71±0.05μM. Also reported
are two biologically active inhibitors against in vitro T. cruzi culture that
were BENZ-GlcN and CBZ-GlcN, with intracellular amastigote growth inhibition IC50
values of 16.08±0.16μM and 48.73±0.69μM, respectively. These compounds revealed
little to no toxicity against mammalian NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and provide a key
starting point for further drug development with this class of compound.
