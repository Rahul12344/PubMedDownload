OBJECTIVE: To derive a plasma biomarker protein panel from a list of 141
candidate proteins which can differentiate transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/minor
stroke from non-cerebrovascular (mimic) conditions in emergency department (ED)
settings.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical study (#NCT03050099) with up to three timed blood
draws no more than 36â€‰h following symptom onset. Plasma samples analysed by
multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (MRM-MS).
PARTICIPANTS: Totally 545 participants suspected of TIA enrolled in the EDs of
two urban medical centres.
OUTCOMES: 90-day, neurologist-adjudicated diagnosis of TIA informed by clinical
and radiological investigations.
RESULTS: The final protein panel consists of 16 proteins whose patterns show
differential abundance between TIA and mimic patients. Nine of the proteins were 
significant univariate predictors of TIA [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)]: 
L-selectin [0.726 (0.596-0.883)]; Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3
[0.727 (0.594-0.889)]; Coagulation factor X [0.740 (0.603-0.908)]; Serum
paraoxonase/lactonase 3 [0.763 (0.630-0.924)]; Thrombospondin-1 [1.313
(1.081-1.595)]; Hyaluronan-binding protein 2 [0.776 (0.637-0.945)]; Heparin
cofactor 2 [0.775 (0.634-0.947)]; Apolipoprotein B-100 [1.249 (1.037-1.503)]; and
von Willebrand factor [1.256 (1.034-1.527)]. The scientific plausibility of the
panel proteins is discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our panel has the potential to assist ED physicians in
distinguishing TIA from mimic patients.
