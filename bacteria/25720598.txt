A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing a multigene cassette for
expression of enzymes that enhance xylose utilization (xylose isomerase [XI] and 
xylulokinase [XKS]) was constructed and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae
to demonstrate feasibility as a stable protein expression system in yeast and to 
design an assembly process suitable for an automated platform. Expression of XI
and XKS from the YAC was confirmed by Western blot and PCR analyses. The
recombinant and wild-type strains showed similar growth on plates containing
hexose sugars, but only recombinant grew on D-xylose and L-arabinose plates. In
glucose fermentation, doubling time (4.6 h) and ethanol yield (0.44 g ethanol/g
glucose) of recombinant were comparable to wild type (4.9 h and 0.44 g/g). In
whole-corn hydrolysate, ethanol yield (0.55 g ethanol/g [glucose + xylose]) and
xylose utilization (38%) for recombinant were higher than for wild type (0.47 g/g
and 12%). In hydrolysate from spent coffee grounds, yield was 0.46 g ethanol/g
(glucose + xylose), and xylose utilization was 93% for recombinant. These results
indicate introducing a YAC expressing XI and XKS enhanced xylose utilization
without affecting integrity of the host strain, and the process provides a
potential platform for automated synthesis of a YAC for expression of multiple
optimized genes to improve yeast strains.
