Flow cytometry of the differentiation of Physarum polycephalum myxamoebae to
cysts.

Fry J, Matthews HR.

Myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum, strain Cld, were grown on agar lawns on live
bacteria. Myxamoebae were harvested, fixed and stained with propidium iodide.
Flow cytometry showed that, as in the case of Physarum plasmodia, there is no G1 
phase during rapid exponential growth. However, an apparent G1 phase was observed
at the end of exponential growth when the culture arrested with the G1 DNA
content for about a day between growth and differentiation. Most myxamoebae
differentiated into cysts, but some formed microplasmodia and others appeared to 
lose DNA. The cysts possessed the G2 phase DNA content and there was an S phase
connecting the G1-arrested state with the encysted state. Encystment was blocked 
by hydroxyurea (HU) suggesting that DNA synthesis is essential for encystment.
The natural temporary synchronization in G1 phase may provide the basis of a
method for selecting mutants with a conditional block in G2 or M phases.
