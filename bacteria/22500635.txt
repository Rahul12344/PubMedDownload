Activity-dependent modifications of chromatin are believed to contribute to
dramatic changes in neuronal circuitry. The mechanisms underlying these
modifications are not fully understood. The histone variant H3.3 is incorporated 
in a replication-independent manner into different regions of the genome,
including gene regulatory elements. It is presently unknown whether H3.3
deposition is involved in neuronal activity-dependent events. Here, we analyze
the role of the histone chaperone DAXX in the regulation of H3.3 incorporation at
activity-dependent gene loci. DAXX is found to be associated with regulatory
regions of selected activity-regulated genes, where it promotes H3.3 loading upon
membrane depolarization. DAXX loss not only affects H3.3 deposition but also
impairs transcriptional induction of these genes. Calcineurin-mediated
dephosphorylation of DAXX is a key molecular switch controlling its function upon
neuronal activation. Overall, these findings implicate the H3.3 chaperone DAXX in
the regulation of activity-dependent events, thus revealing a new mechanism
underlying epigenetic modifications in neurons.
