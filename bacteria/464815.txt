Appendicitis and aortofemoral graft infection.

Krupski WC, Mitchell RA, Gewertz BL, Fry WJ.

A 59-year-old man who underwent successful aortofemoral bypass had acute
appendicitis at an indeterminate time in the postoperative period. Thirteen
months later, a pulsatile groin mass developed. After a complicated course, it
was found that infection from appendicitis had extended to the body of the graft.
This unusual cause of graft infection reaffirms the importance of careful closure
of the retroperitoneum over an aortic anastomosis and suggests a relationship of 
other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes to graft infection.
