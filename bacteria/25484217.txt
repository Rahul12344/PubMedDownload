KstR2 (Rv3557c) is one of two TetR-family transcriptional repressors of
cholesterol metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The ability to degrade
cholesterol fully is important for pathogenesis, and therefore this repressor was
expressed, purified and crystallized. Crystals of KstR2 diffracted to better than
1.9 Å resolution and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
72.3, b = 90.3, c = 49.7 Å, α = γ = 90, β = 128.2°.
