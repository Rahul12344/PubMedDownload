A case of granulocytic ehrlichiosis is described in a roe deer (Capreolus
capreolus) calf from Norway. The calf was heavily infested with Ixodes ricinus
and died from Escherichia coli septicemia. Granulocytic Ehrlichia sp. was
detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from several organs and sequence
determination identified a variant of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE)
agent. This is the first report of a possible clinical granulocytic Ehrlichia sp.
infection in a roe deer.
