A solvent tolerant bacterium Serratia marcescens NCIM 2919 has been evaluated for
degradation of DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane). The
bacterium was able to degrade up to 42% of initial 50 mg L-1 of DDT within
10 days of incubation. The highlight of the work was the elucidation of DDT
degradation pathway in S. marcescens. A total of four intermediates metabolites
viz. 2,2-bis (chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (DDD), 2,2-bis
(chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE), 2,2-bis
(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethylene (DDMU), and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA) were
identified by GC-Mass and FTIR. 4-CBA was found to be the stable product of DDT
degradation. Metabolites preceding 4-CBA were not toxic to strain as reveled
through luxuriant growth in presence of varying concentrations of exogenous DDD
and DDE. However, 4-CBA was observed to inhibit the growth of bacterium. The DDT 
degrading efficiency of S. marcescens NCIM 2919 hence could be used in
combination with 4-CBA utilizing strains either as binary culture or consortia
for mineralization of DDT. Application of S. marcescens NCIM 2919 to DDT
contaminated soil, showed 74.7% reduction of initial 12.0 mg kg-1 of DDT after
18-days of treatment.
