Fluorescent protein biosensors are typically implemented via genetic encoding
which makes the examination of scarce cell samples impractical. By directly
delivering the protein form of the biosensor into cells using electroporation, we
detected intracellular molecular activity with the sample size down to âˆ¼100 cells
with high spatiotemporal resolution.
