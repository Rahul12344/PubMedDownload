Selective autophagy performs an array of tasks to maintain intracellular
homeostasis, sterility, and organellar and cellular functionality. The fidelity
of these processes depends on precise target recognition and limited activation
of the autophagy apparatus in a localized fashion. Here we describe cooperation
in such processes between the TRIM family and Galectin family of proteins. TRIMs,
which are E3 ubiquitin ligases, displayed propensity to associate with Galectins.
One specific TRIM, TRIM16, interacted with Galectin-3 in a ULK1-dependent manner.
TRIM16, through integration of Galectin- and ubiquitin-based processes,
coordinated recognition of membrane damage with mobilization of the core
autophagy regulators ATG16L1, ULK1, and Beclin 1 in response to damaged
endomembranes. TRIM16 affected mTOR, interacted with TFEB, and influenced TFEB's 
nuclear translocation. The cooperation between TRIM16 and Galectin-3 in targeting
and activation of selective autophagy protects cells from lysosomal damage and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion.
