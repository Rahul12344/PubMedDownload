Isoniazid and rifampin are essential components of first-line antituberculosis
(anti-TB) therapy. Understanding the relationship between genetic factors and the
pharmacokinetics of these drugs could be useful in optimizing treatment outcomes,
but this is understudied in children. We investigated the relationship between
N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2) genotypes and isoniazid pharmacokinetics, as
well as that between the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member
1B1 (encoded by SLCO1B1) and carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and rifampin pharmacokinetics in Ghanaian children. Blood
samples were collected at times 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h postdose in children with
tuberculosis on standard first-line therapy for at least 4 weeks. Isoniazid and
rifampin concentrations were determined by a validated liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, and pharmacokinetic
parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Genotyping of NAT2,
SLCO1B1, and CES2 SNPs were performed using validated TaqMan genotyping assays.
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters among the 
three genotypic groups and was followed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test for
pairwise group comparisons. Genotype status inferred by the NAT2 4-SNP and 7-SNP 
genotyping panels identified children with a slow acetylator phenotype but not
the rapid genotype. For rifampin, only the rare SLCO1B1*1b homozygous variant was
associated with rifampin pharmacokinetics. Our findings suggest that NAT2 and
SCLCO1B1*1b genotyping may have minimal clinical utility in dosing decisions at
the population level in Ghanaian children, but it could be useful at the
individual level or in populations that have a high frequency of implicated
genotypes. Further studies in other populations are warranted.
