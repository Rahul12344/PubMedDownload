Members of the POU and SOX transcription factor families exemplify the
partnerships established between various transcriptional regulators during early 
embryonic development. Although functional cooperativity between key regulator
proteins is pivotal for milestone decisions in mammalian development, little is
known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we focus on two
transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, as their combination on DNA is considered
to direct the establishment of the first three lineages in the mammalian embryo. 
Using experimental high-resolution structure determination, followed by model
building and experimental validation, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 were able to
dimerize onto DNA in distinct conformational arrangements. We demonstrate that
the DNA enhancer region of their target genes is responsible for the correct
spatial alignment of glue-like interaction domains on their surface.
Interestingly, these surfaces frequently have redundant functions and are
instrumental in recruiting various interacting protein partners.
