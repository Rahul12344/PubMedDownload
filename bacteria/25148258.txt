Ascorbyl lipophilic derivatives (Asc-C2 to Asc-C(18:1)) were synthesized in a
good yield using lipase from Staphylococcus xylosus produced in our laboratory
and immobilized onto silica aerogel. Results showed that esterification had
little effect on radical-scavenging capacity of purified ascorbyl esters using
DPPH assay in ethanol. However, long chain fatty acid esters displayed higher
protection of target lipids from oxidation. Moreover, compared to ascorbic acid, 
synthesized derivatives exhibited an antibacterial effect. Furthermore, ascorbyl 
derivatives were evaluated, for the first time, for their antileishmanial effects
against visceral (Leishmania infantum) and cutaneous parasites (Leishmania
major). Among all the tested compounds, only Asc-C10, Asc-C12, and Asc-C(18:1)
exhibited antileishmanial activities. The interaction of ascorbyl esters with a
phospholipid monolayer showed that only medium and unsaturated long chain
(Asc-C10 to Asc-C(18:1)) derivative esters were found to interact efficiently
with mimetic membrane of leishmania. These properties would make ascorbyl
derivatives good candidates to be used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical lipophilic 
formulations.
