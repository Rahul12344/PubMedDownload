Respiratory electron transport complexes are organized as individual entities or 
combined as large supercomplexes (SC). Gram-negative bacteria deploy a
mitochondrial-like cytochrome (cyt) bc1 (Complex III, CIII2), and may have
specific cbb3-type cyt c oxidases (Complex IV, CIV) instead of the canonical
aa3-type CIV. Electron transfer between these complexes is mediated by soluble
(c2) and membrane-anchored (cy) cyts. Here, we report the structure of an
engineered bc1-cbb3 type SC (CIII2CIV, 5.2 Å resolution) and three conformers of 
native CIII2 (3.3 Å resolution). The SC is active in vivo and in vitro, contains 
all catalytic subunits and cofactors, and two extra transmembrane helices
attributed to cyt cy and the assembly factor CcoH. The cyt cy is integral to SC, 
its cyt domain is mobile and it conveys electrons to CIV differently than cyt c2.
The successful production of a native-like functional SC and determination of its
structure illustrate the characteristics of membrane-confined and
membrane-external respiratory electron transport pathways in Gram-negative
bacteria.
