BACKGROUND: Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) is used clinically to promote
periodontal tissue regeneration with variable efficacy. EMD application results
in significantly higher frequencies of sites without clinical signs of
inflammation; additionally, patients receiving EMD therapy report significantly
less post-treatment discomfort. However, there are few reports that focus on
defining the biologic mechanisms for the observed anti-inflammatory effects of
EMD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of EMD on
inflammatory-associated markers using an in vitro monocyte assay.
METHODS: Rat monocytes were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml from
Escherichia coli or Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) along with EMD (0, 50, 
100, or 200 microg/ml). Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and
prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in conditioned media were analyzed by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. In addition, the effects of exogenous PGE(2) on TNF-alpha
production from LPS-stimulated monocytes were determined.
RESULTS: LPS-stimulated monocytes exposed to EMD exhibited a decrease in
TNF-alpha production (0.10- to 0.52-fold) and an increase in PGE(2) production
(1.31- to 2.71-fold) compared to controls not treated with EMD. Exogenously
applied PGE(2) decreased TNF-alpha production by LPS-stimulated monocytes in a
dose-dependent manner, and EMD treatment enhanced this PGE(2)-mediated inhibition
of TNF-alpha production.
CONCLUSION: In addition to EMD's published role in inducing proliferation,
migration, adhesion, mineralization, and differentiation of periodontal ligament 
cells, our results indicated that EMD modulates two inflammation-associated
factors, TNF-alpha and PGE(2), in monocytes.
