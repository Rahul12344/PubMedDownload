Activated T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming and effector-cell
differentiation but the factors involved are unclear. Utilizing mice lacking
DUSP6 (DUSP6-/-), we show that this phosphatase regulates T cell receptor (TCR)
signaling to influence follicular helper T (TFH) cell differentiation and T cell 
metabolism. In vitro, DUSP6-/- CD4+ TFH cells produced elevated IL-21. In vivo,
TFH cells were increased in DUSP6-/- mice and in transgenic OTII-DUSP6-/- mice at
steady state. After immunization, DUSP6-/- and OTII-DUSP6-/- mice generated more 
TFH cells and produced more antigen-specific IgG2 than controls. Activated
DUSP6-/- T cells showed enhanced JNK and p38 phosphorylation but impaired
glycolysis. JNK or p38 inhibitors significantly reduced IL-21 production but did 
not restore glycolysis. TCR-stimulated DUSP6-/- T cells could not induce
phosphofructokinase activity and relied on glucose-independent fueling of
mitochondrial respiration. Upon CD28 costimulation, activated DUSP6-/- T cells
did not undergo the metabolic commitment to glycolysis pathway to maintain
viability. Unexpectedly, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation drastically lowered
IL-21 production in DUSP6-/- TFH cells. Our findings suggest that DUSP6 connects 
TCR signaling to activation-induced metabolic commitment toward glycolysis and
restrains TFH cell differentiation via inhibiting IL-21 production.
