Application of Bathurin and borax in the biological control of Monomorium
pharaonis in housing estates.

Vobr치zkov치 E, Vankov치 J, Samsin치k K.

Of two apartment houses infested with ants of the species Monomorium pharaonis,
one was treated with a biological, the other with a chemical substance. In the
first case we used Bathurin in combination with borax at a concentration of 1.3% 
for both substances. In the first week, borax was added to the bait (minced
beef), within the next three weeks, the bait was mixed with Bathurin. The
procedure was repeated 5 times. After this period, we achieved complete control
of the ants on the infested premises.--Our results obtained with the chemical
substance (the insecticide Anthrix) were less successful. This indicates that the
first method, although time-consuming and requiring a perfect collaboration with 
all inhabitants, is safer, because it leads to the complete eradication of ants
in the infested premises.
