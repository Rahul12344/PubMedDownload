BACKGROUND AIMS: For transplantation, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are obtained
from bone marrow, cord blood and mobilized adult peripheral blood. HSCs are
present in the blood of healthy adults and can be recovered in leuko-reduction
system chambers, with a potential yield of 1 to 4 × 10(6) CD34+ cells per unit.
Some groups have investigated this valuable source of stem cells; however,
investigations are still needed to support their use.
METHODS: CD34+ cells were purified from leuko-reduction system chambers and
cultured with a defined custom medium without animal protein and supplemented
with interleukin-3, interleukin-6, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, stem cell factor
and thrombopoietin. Cells were cultured under 8% and 21% oxygen levels. With the 
use of multiparametric flow cytometry analysis, the phenotypes of emerging
populations were compared between oxygen levels and resting CD34+ cells. Both
conventional gating and clustering analysis were used to visualize the cellular
outcome.
RESULTS: A maximum expansion of 20-fold was obtained without major differences in
viability, number of cells or cellular heterogeneity between atmospheric and
physiologic oxygen conditions. Worthy of note, phenotype analysis revealed that
megakaryocyte and erythrocyte progenitors were favored, albeit more moderately
when submitted to 8% O2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the bias of cultured blood CD34+ cells
toward megakaryocyte and erythrocyte progenitor cells can be reduced by use of 8%
pO2. It also shows how clustering software, such as SPADE, can help visualize the
complexity of stem cell differentiation.
