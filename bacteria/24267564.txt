The difficulty in the purification of bioactive peptide limited its application
in food, drug and cosmetic industry. Here we report a new strategy for the
recovery of two peptides employing glutamate-specific endopeptidase from Bacillus
licheniformis (GSE-BL), which shows strong specificity for Glu residue. Human
glucagon and human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) were peptides without Glu residue, and
Glu residue was introduced between affinity tag and target peptide as recognition
site of GSE-BL. Tagless human glucagon with the same HPLC retention time as
native human glucagon and mature HBD-2 with antibacterial activity and
cytotoxicity were obtained after GSE-BL treatment. This strategy has great
potential in the recovery of bioactive peptide without Glu residue, thus
facilitating large scale preparation of peptide and widening the application of
bioactive peptide.
