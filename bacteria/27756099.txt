Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have an immunosuppressive role in the tumor
microenvironment. Since effector Tregs (eTregs), which have highly suppressive
functions, are located in a subpopulation of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs, the TCR-inducible
costimulatory receptor (ICOS) was applied as a marker of eTregs that infiltrated 
gastric cancer tissue and the induction pathway of ICOS+ Foxp3+ cells was
analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs), ICOS+ Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells were abundantly observed in the
late stages of gastric cancer. ICOS+ CD4+ TILs exhibited the ability to produce
IL-10, but not IFN-γ, TNF, or IL-17 and also to suppress the proliferation of
CFSE-labeled responder CD8+ T cells. With the agonistic ICOS-L protein (rICOS-L
Ig), ICOS+ Foxp3+ cells were efficiently induced from naive CD4+ T cells under a 
stimulation with TGF-β and CD3/CD28 mAbs. Furthermore, when A*0201 PBMCs were
cultured with the CMV or Melan-A antigenic peptide and rICOS-L Ig, the induction 
of CMV or Melan-A tetramer-binding CD8+ T cells, respectively, was inhibited. The
expression of ICOS in Foxp3+ cells was closely related to plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells (pDCs) and their expression of ICOS-L and TLR9 as well as Helicobacter
pylori infection. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of ICOS as 
a promising target for direct Treg-targeting therapeutic agents for gastric
cancer, and that of eradicating therapy for H. pylori as an indirect immune
therapy for gastric cancer.
