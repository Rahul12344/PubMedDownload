The interaction of macrophages with infectious agents leads to the activation of 
several signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases,
such as p38. We now demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase-mediated responses are
critical components to the immune response to Borrelia burgdorferi. The
pharmacological and genetic inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity during
infection with the spirochete results in increased carditis. In transgenic mice
that express a dominant negative form of p38 MAP kinase specifically in
macrophages, production of the invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell-attracting 
chemokine MCP-1 and of the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d are significantly
reduced. The expression of the transgene therefore results in the deficient
infiltration of iNKT cells, their decreased activation, and a diminished
production of interferon γ (IFN-γ), leading to increased bacterial burdens and
inflammation. These results show that p38 MAP kinase provides critical
checkpoints for the protective immune response to the spirochete during infection
of the heart.
