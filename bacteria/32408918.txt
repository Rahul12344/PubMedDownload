We report two cases of respiratory toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae
infection in fully vaccinated UK born adults following travel to Tunisia in
October 2019. Both patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and
neither received diphtheria antitoxin. Contact tracing was performed following a 
risk assessment but no additional cases were identified. This report highlights
the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for re-emerging
infections in patients with a history of travel to high-risk areas outside
Europe.
