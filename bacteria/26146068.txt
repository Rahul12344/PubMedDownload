OBJECTIVE: To identify the distribution of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21
(CCL21) in the thymus of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and explore the
effects of up-regulation of CCL21 on the expressions of antigen
presentation-related genes in cytokeratin 8/18 (CK8/18) positive thymic
epithelial cells (TECs) after transfected with CCL21 genes.
METHODS: The expressions and distributions of CK8/18 and CCL21 in the thymus
tissue of MG patients were detected by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of
CCL21, CCL19 and their receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7 (CCR7) in the
thymus tissue of MG patients were determined by real-time quantitative PCR
(qRT-PCR). Primary cultured CK8/18⁺ TECs were transfected with pCMV-CCL21, and
the relative mRNA expressions of function-associated genes (CD80, ICAM-1, CD86,
HLA-DR, HLA-A) in CK8/18⁺ TECs before and after the transfection were
investigated by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical results showed that the number of CK8/18 positive
cells in the hyperplastic thymus tissues of MG patients was significantly more
than that in the normal controls, and the protein expression of CCL21 was also
much higher in the hyperplastic thymus tissues. The qRT-PCR showed that the
expressions of CCL21 and CCR7 mRNA increased significantly in hyperplastic thymus
tissues of MG patients compared with those in normal controls, while there was no
difference in the expression of CCL19. Furthermore, CK8/18 positive cells were
found mainly located in cortico-medullary junction and medulla area. The relative
mRNA expression levels of HLA-A, HLA-DR, ICAM and CD80 rose significantly in
CK8/18⁺ TECs after transfected with pCMV-CCL21.
CONCLUSION: The over-expression of CCL21 could increased the expressions of
antigen presentation-related genes in CK8/18⁺ TECs in MG patients.
