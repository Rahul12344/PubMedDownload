The cytokine IL-17 controls neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses. The
pattern recognition receptor(s) that induce Th17 responses during infection, in
the absence of artificial mitogenic stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28
antibodies, remain obscure. We investigated the innate immune receptors and
pathogen-associated molecular patterns involved in triggering Th17 responses
during pathogen-specific host defense. The prototypic fungal pathogen Candida
albicans was found to induce IL-17 more potently than Gram-negative bacteria.
Candida mannan, but not zymosan, beta-glucans, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists,
or the NOD2 ligand MDP, induced IL-17 production in the absence of
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. Candida-induced IL-17 response was dependent on
antigen-presenting cells and the macrophage mannose receptor (MR), demonstrating 
that Candida mannan is not simply a mitogenic stimulus. The TLR2/dectin-1
pathway, but not TLR4 or NOD2, amplified MR-induced IL-17 production. This study 
identifies the specific pattern recognition receptors that trigger the Th17
response induced by a human pathogen in the absence of mitogenic stimulation.
