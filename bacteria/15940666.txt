CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells belong to the innate-like
lymphocytes which respond rapidly to stress and infectious challenge. We have
studied murine CD1d-restricted NKT cells in the early immune response to virulent
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium after oral infection. In the liver and
spleen, neutrophil and macrophage numbers had increased several-fold by day 5
post-infection, while the frequency of B and T lymphocytes decreased. These
cellular changes occurred independently of CD1d-restricted NKT cells, and
further, CD1d-restricted T cells did not influence the bacterial load. However,
in CD1d(+) mice NK1.1(+) T cells and invariant CD1d-restricted T cells were
activated by the infection, as demonstrated by an increase in size, up-regulation
of CD69 and production of IFN-gamma. The NK1.1 antigen was down-modulated on
these cells during the course of infection, while TCR levels were unaffected.
While dendritic cells (DC) up-regulated CD1d-levels upon 24 h of in vitro
exposure to the bacteria, increased CD1d expression was not evident on DC in vivo
during infection. Furthermore, in vitro re-stimulation of CD1d-restricted T cells
isolated from infected mice demonstrated a significant skewing of the cytokine
profile, with suppressed IL-4 and increased IFN-gamma production.
