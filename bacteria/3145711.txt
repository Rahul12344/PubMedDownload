A method for in situ mating experiments is described which involved overnight
incorporation of donors containing the mercury resistance plasmid pQM1 and
recipients into the epilithon on separate river stones. The stones were then
joined to begin the mating. Transfer frequencies obtained were between 2.2 x
10(-1) and 2.5 x 10(-6) per recipient and appeared to depend on the
donor-to-recipient ratio (489/1 to 0.0047/1) and not on the river temperature (12
to 19 degrees C). Controls showed that the low density of donors and recipients
at the end of the experiment (3.4 x 10(2) to 7.0 x 10(5) cm-2) did not
significantly affect the heterotrophic bacterial count (1.43 x 10(6) to 6.39 x
10(6) cm-2) nor the fluorescent-pseudomonad count (2.3 x 10(4) to 9.33 x 10(4)
cm-2).
