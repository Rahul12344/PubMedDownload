DNA processing by site-specific proteins on surface remains a challenging issue
for nanobioscience applications and, in particular, for high-resolution imaging
by atomic force microscopy (AFM). To obtain high-resolution conditions, mica, an 
atomically flat and negatively charged surface, is generally used. However, even 
though many specific DNA/protein interactions have already been observed by AFM, 
little is known about DNA accessibility to specific enzymes on mica. Here we
measured the accessibility of adsorbed DNA to restriction endonucleases (EcoRI
and EcoRV) using AFM. By increasing the concentration of divalent or multivalent 
salts, DNA adsorption on mica switches from weak to strong binding.
Interestingly, while the accessibility of strongly bound DNA was inhibited,
loosely adsorbed DNA was efficiently cleaved on mica. This result opens new
perspective to study DNA/protein interaction by AFM or to modify specifically DNA
on surface.
