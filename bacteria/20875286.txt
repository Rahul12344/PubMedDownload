Infection source can determine cost-effective public health interventions. To
quantify risk of acquiring Toxoplasma gondii from environmental sources versus
from meat, we examined serum from pregnant women in Chile. Because 43% had
oocyst-specific antibodies, we conclude that contaminated meat remains the
primary source of infection but that environmental sources also pose substantial 
risk.
