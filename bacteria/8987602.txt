In the structure of sakuranetin, which was isolated as a phytoalexin from the
rice plant, the methoxy group at C-7 has been shown to be important for its high 
activity. Apigeninidin was isolated as a phytoalexin from sorghum, but it had no 
methoxy group at C-7. We prepared 7-methoxyapigeninidin and compared its
fungicidal activity with that of apigeninidin. The 7-methoxyapigeninidin showed
higher activity against sorghum fungi than apigeninidin, suggesting that the
methoxy group at C-7 was important for the high fungicidal activity.
