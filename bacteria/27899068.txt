BACKGROUND: TBM (Tuberculous meningitis) is severe form of tuberculosis causing
death of one third of the affected individuals or leaving two-third of the
survivors disabled. MMP-9 (Matrix metalloproteinase-9) is produced by the central
nervous system in a variety of inflammatory conditions and has a role in the
breakdown of extracellular matrix and blood-brain barrier.
METHODS: In this study, the levels of MMP-9 and its inhibitor, TIMP-1 (tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1), were screened using zymography and reverse
zymography in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of tuberculous meningitis patients at
different stages of the disease. Further, role of MMP-9 as therapeutic target was
studied in C6 glioma cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Cells 
were treated with dexamethasone or SB-3CT (specific inhibitor of MMP-9) in
combination with conventional antitubercular drugs.
RESULTS: MMP-9 levels in patients were increased as the disease progressed to
advanced stages. The infection led to increased MMP-9 levels in C6 glioma cells
and specific inhibition of MMP-9 by SB-3CT augmented bacillary clearance when
used along with antitubercular drugs.
CONCLUSION: MMP-9 plays a prominent role in progression of tuberculous meningitis
from initial to advanced stages. Increased levels of MMP-9 during advancement of 
the disease leads to degeneration of nervous tissue and blood brain barrier
disruption. Hence, MMP-9 can be considered as a therapeutic target for efficient 
management of TBM and can be explored to inhibit further progression of the
disease if used at an early stage.
