T-cell-mediated immune responses play a fundamental role in controlling
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection, and traditionally, this
response is thought to be mediated by Th1-type CD4+ T-cells secreting IFN-γ.
While studying the function and specificity of M. tuberculosis-reactive CD4+
T-cells in more detail at the single cell level; however, we found a human CD4+
T-cell population with a naive phenotype that interestingly was capable of
producing multiple cytokines (TCNP cells). CD4+ TCNP cells phenotyped as CD95lo
CD28int CD49dhi CXCR3hi and showed a broad distribution of T cell receptor Vβ
segments. They rapidly secreted multiple cytokines in response to different M.
tuberculosis antigens, their frequency was increased during active disease, but
was comparable to latent tuberculosis infection in treated TB patients. These
results identify a novel human CD4+ T-cell subset involved in the human immune
response to mycobacteria, which is present in active TB patients' blood. These
results significantly expand our understanding of the immune response in
infectious diseases.
