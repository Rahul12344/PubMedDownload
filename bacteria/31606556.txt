The disinfection performance of a flow-through electrode system (FES) was
systematically evaluated using different carbonized (C1, C2, and C3) and
corresponding graphitized (G1, G2, and G3) carbon fiber felt (CFF) electrodes.
The physicochemical and electrochemical properties were characterized to identify
the differences among CFFs. Graphitized CFFs (gCFFs) can achieve complete
inactivation of Escherichia coli (>6 log) at the voltage of 3 V and flux of
120-3600 L/(m2 h) for high conductivity and chemical stability, while carbonized 
CFFs (cCFFs) only achieved around 1 log removal with obvious carbon corrosion.
For the gCFFs, G1 (>6 log removal) with higher conductivity, better graphite
structure, and larger surface area (related to fiber diameter and density)
presented better disinfection performance at the flow rate of 30 mL/min than G2
(∼3 log) and G3(∼1 log). Furthermore, no regrowth and reactivation of bacteria
occurred during the storage under visible light illumination after FES treatment.
Three parallel FESs with G1 were operated continuously for one week (24 h per
day, 7 days) treating the solution with an E. coli concentration ranging from 106
to 107 CFU/mL at the applied voltage of 3 V and the flow rate of 20 mL/min. No
live bacteria were detected in the effluent of any of these three FESs. In-situ
sampling experiments demonstrated that the inactivation of bacteria on anode was 
the dominant mechanism for FES treatment, which can be attributed to the
sequential adsorption, direct-oxidation and desorption process on anode, instead 
of indirect oxidation by generating chemical oxidants. In addition, hydroxide ion
generated from cathode reaction enhanced anode adsorption and inactivation of
bacteria by providing alkaline environment. Combining the analysis results of
material properties and disinfection performance, the gCFF-based FES was
suggested to be a low-cost, high-efficiency, and safe alternative for future
water disinfection.
