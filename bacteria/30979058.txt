HGF (hepatocyte growth factor)/HGFR (HGF receptor) signaling pathway is a key
pathway in liver protection and regeneration after acute toxic damage. Listeria
monocytogenes toxin InlB contains a HGFR-interacting domain and is a functional
analog of HGF. The aim of this work was to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity
of the InlB HGFR-interacting domain. The recombinant HGFR-interacting domain
InlB321/15 was purified from E. coli. MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test was used to
measure InlB321/15 mitogenic activity in HepG2 cells. Activation of MAPK- and
PI3K/Akt-pathways was tracked with fluorescent microscopy, Western blotting, and 
ELISA. To evaluate hepatoprotective activity, InlB321/15 and recombinant human
HGF (rhHGF) were intravenously injected at the same concentration of 2 ng·g-1 to 
BALB/c mice 2 h before liver injury with CCl₄. InlB321/15 caused dose-dependent
activation of MAPK- and PI3K/Akt-pathways and correspondent mitogenic effects.
Both InlB321/15 and rhHGF improved macroscopic liver parameters (liver mass was
1.51, 1.27 and 1.15 g for the vehicle, InlB321/15 and rhHGF, respectively, p <
0.05), reduced necrosis (24.0%, 16.18% and 21.66% of the total area for the
vehicle, InlB321/15 and rhHGF, respectively, p < 0.05). Obtained data suggest
that InlB321/15 is a promising candidate for a tissue repair agent.
