The human major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) region encodes a
cluster of polymorphic heterodimeric glycoproteins HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP that
functions in antigen presentation. Separated by approximately 44 kb of DNA, the
HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 encode MHC-II proteins that function in separate MHC-II
heterodimers and are diametrically transcribed. A region of high acetylation
located in the intergenic sequences between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 was discovered 
and termed XL9. The peak of acetylation coincided with sequences that bound the
insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor as determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitations and in vitro DNA binding studies. XL9 was also found to be
associated with the nuclear matrix. The activity of the XL9 region was examined
and found to be a potent enhancer-blocking element. These results suggest that
the XL9 region may have evolved to separate the transcriptional units of the
HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes.
