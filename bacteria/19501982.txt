Antibiotic usage is essential for infection control but hastens emergence of
antibiotic resistant microbes. In particular, Acinetobacter baumannii is an
important pathogen because of its heightened ability to acquire drug resistance. 
The need for novel antibacterial agents led us to evaluate the sensitivity of
drug-resistant bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of human beta defensin 4
(HBD-4). Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (N=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=15),
and Staphylococcus aureus (N=20), including 10 methicillin-resistant (MRSA)
isolates, were examined. All bacterial strains were susceptible to HBD-4
antimicrobial activity, with no correlation between antibiotic resistance and
HBD-4 sensitivity. The results demonstrate that antibiotic resistant
microorganisms, including MRSA, can be inhibited by HBD-4, which may represent an
effective therapeutic agent for infections involving drug-resistant
microorganisms.
