The human p68 protein, an SV40 large T related antigen, is an RNA dependent
ATPase and RNA helicase. It belongs to a new large and highly conserved gene
family, the DEAD box proteins, whose members are involved in a variety of
processes requiring manipulation of RNA secondary structure such as translation
and splicing. Multiple DEAD box genes are present in S.cerevisiae, but only one
has previously been described in E.coli. Low stringency screening of an E.coli
genomic library with a p68 cDNA probe led to the identification of dbpA, a new
E.coli DEAD box gene located at 29.6 minutes on the W3110 chromosome. We report
here the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the gene. We have
overexpressed dbpA from its own promoter on a high copy number plasmid and
identified the gene product as a approximately 50 kD protein by immunoblotting
with an anti-DEAD antibody.
