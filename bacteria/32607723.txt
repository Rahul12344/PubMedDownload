Determinant genes controlling biofilm formation in a plant commensal bacterium,
Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5, were identified by transposon mutagenesis.
Comprehensive screening of 7500 transposon-inserted mutants led to the isolation 
of four mutants exhibiting decreased and five mutants exhibiting increased
biofilm formation. Mutations in the genes encoding MFS drug resistance
transporter, LapA adhesive protein, RetS sensor histidine kinase/response
regulator, and HecA adhesin/hemagglutinin led to decreased biofilm formation,
indicating that these genes are necessary for biofilm formation in Pf-5. The
mutants exhibiting increased biofilm formation had transposon insertions in the
genes coding for an outer membrane protein, a GGDEF domain-containing protein,
AraC transcriptional regulator, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase OfaB, and the
intergenic region of a DNA-binding protein and the Aer aerotaxis receptor,
suggesting that these genes are negative regulators of biofilm formation. Some of
these mutants also showed altered swimming and swarming motilities, and a
negative correlation between biofilm formation and swarming motility was
observed. Thus, sessile-motile lifestyle is regulated by divergent regulatory
genes in Pf-5.
