DNA-based typing of HLA class I alleles of the HLA-A and HLA-B loci using
sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers and/or probes has been used for the
large-scale typing of individuals for the National Marrow Donor Program unrelated
donor registry. Typing was performed by 16 laboratories at a low level of
resolution (e.g. A*01, B*07). The results of blinded quality control analysis for
the first 12 months of the project show the typing to be highly accurate,
specific and reliable. The total error rate based on 11,545 HLA-A and 11,428
HLA-B assignments was 1.1% for HLA-A and 1.9% for HLA-B. This level of accuracy
is particularly remarkable because the quality control samples could not be
distinguished from 64,180 donor samples tested at the same time by the
laboratories.
