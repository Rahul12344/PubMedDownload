OBJECTIVES: The present in-vitro study examined the effects of different
biomaterials on early root surface colonization by human periodontal ligament
(PDL) fibroblasts using confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy (CLSM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontally-diseased teeth were extracted,
treated with scaling/root planing and longitudinally cut to obtain 30 root
fragments. Fragments were treated either with 24% EDTA following application of
enamel matrix derivative (EMD), 24% EDTA or EMD only, nanocrystalline
hydroxyapatite (NHA) paste or oily calcium hydroxide suspension (OCHS) for 1 h
each. The analogue untreated root specimens served as controls. Root fragments
were incubated with human PDL fibroblasts and cellular proliferation and
morphology were evaluated after 1, 3, 5 and 8 days using CLSM-visualization and
image recognition software.
RESULTS: The rate of cellular proliferation was different among treatment
modalities examined (p = 0.019). Except treatment with NHA paste all treatment
modalities improved cellular proliferation on root surfaces at all different
points of time compared with the control specimens. A significant difference
between treatment modalities was observed between EMD and NHA paste (p = 0.008). 
No synergistic effect could be demonstrated comparing root surface conditioning
with 24% EDTA and EMD application compared to 24% EDTA or EMD application only.
CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that initial root surface colonization by
PDL fibroblasts may be enhanced by root surface conditioning with 24% EDTA and
application of EMD, application of 24% EDTA or EMD alone and OCHS. The addition
of 24% EDTA for root surface conditioning prior to EMD application provided no
synergistic effects in terms of early root surface colonization by PDL
fibroblasts.
