There is an urgent need for new drugs against tuberculosis which annually claims 
1.7-1.8 million lives. One approach to identify potential leads is to screen in
vitro small molecules against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Until recently
there was no central repository to collect information on compounds screened.
Consequently, it has been difficult to analyze molecular properties of compounds 
that inhibit the growth of Mtb in vitro. We have collected data from publically
available sources on over 300 000 small molecules deposited in the Collaborative 
Drug Discovery TB Database. A cheminformatics analysis on these compounds
indicates that inhibitors of the growth of Mtb have statistically higher mean
logP, rule of 5 alerts, while also having lower HBD count, atom count and lower
PSA (ChemAxon descriptors), compared to compounds that are classed as inactive.
Additionally, Bayesian models for selecting Mtb active compounds were evaluated
with over 100 000 compounds and, they demonstrated 10 fold enrichment over random
for the top ranked 600 compounds. This represents a promising approach for
finding compounds active against Mtb in whole cells screened under the same in
vitro conditions. Various sets of Mtb hit molecules were also examined by various
filtering rules used widely in the pharmaceutical industry to identify compounds 
with potentially reactive moieties. We found differences between the number of
compounds flagged by these rules in Mtb datasets, malaria hits, FDA approved
drugs and antibiotics. Combining these approaches may enable selection of
compounds with increased probability of inhibition of whole cell Mtb activity.
