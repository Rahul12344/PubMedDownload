Reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly originated from mitochondrial respiration, 
are critical inducers of oxidative damage and involved in tissue dysfunction. It 
is not clear, however, whether oxidative stress is the result of an active gene
program or it is the by-product of physiological processes. Recent findings
demonstrate that ROS are produced by mitochondria in a controlled way through
specialized enzymes, including p66Shc, and take part in cellular process aimed to
ensure adaptation and fitness. Therefore, genes generating specifically ROS are
selected determinants of life span in response to different environmental
conditions.
