PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advances in both murine models and clinical research of
neutrophilic asthma are improving our understanding on the etiology and
pathophysiology of this enigmatic endotype of asthma. We here aim at providing an
overview of our current and latest insights on the pathophysiology and treatment 
of neutrophilic asthma.
RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway with increased
IL-1Î² has been demonstrated in various studies involving patients with asthma. It
has been suggested that type 3 innate lymphoid cells are implicated in the
inflammatory cascade leading to neutrophilic inflammation. The role of neutrophil
extracellular traps is only at the start of being understood and might be an
attractive novel therapeutic target. A diverse panel of nonallergic stimuli, such
as cigarette smoke, intensive exercise, cold air or saturated fatty acids, have
been linked with neutrophilic airway inflammation. Azithromycin treatment could
reduce asthma exacerbations and quality of life in patients with persistent
asthma.
SUMMARY: Research of the last few years has accelerated our insights in
mechanisms underlying neutrophilic asthma. This is in stark contrast with the
lack of efficacy of different therapies targeting neutrophil chemotaxis and/or
signalling cascade, such as IL-17A or CXCR2. Macrolide therapy might be a useful 
add-on therapy for patients with persistent asthma.
