BACKGROUND: Prostate cells secrete many molecules capable of regulating
angiogenesis; however, which of these actually function as essential regulators
of neovascularization is not yet clear.
METHODS: Functional angiogenic mediators secreted by normal and diseased prostate
cells were identified using an in vitro angiogenesis assay. These factors were
quantified by immunoblot or ELISA and localized in tissue by
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Normal prostate epithelial cell secretions were anti-angiogenic due to
inhibitory thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) whereas this inhibitor was decreased in the
pro-angiogenic secretions derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and
cancer cells. This pro-angiogenic activity depended primarily on fibroblast
growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and/or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) whose
secretion was increased. Immunolocalization studies confirmed that the changes
detected in vitro also occurred in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: During disease progression in the prostate, production of TSP-1, the
major inhibitor, is down-regulated while that of stimulatory FGF-2 and/or VEGF
rise, leading to the induction of the new vessels necessary to support tumor
growth.
