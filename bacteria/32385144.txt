BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated peptides presented by MHC molecules represent a new
class of neoantigens expressed on cancer cells and recognized by CD8 T-cells.
These peptides are promising targets for cancer immunotherapy. Previous work
identified an HLA-A*0201-restricted phosphopeptide from insulin receptor
substrate 2 (pIRS2) as one such target. The purpose of this study was to
characterize a second phosphopeptide, from breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 
3 (BCAR3), and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a novel immunotherapic
vaccine comprising either or both of these phosphorylated peptides.
METHODS: Phosphorylated BCAR3 protein was evaluated in melanoma and breast cancer
cell lines by Western blot, and recognition by T-cells specific for
HLA-A*0201-restricted phosphorylated BCAR3 peptide (pBCAR3126-134) was determined
by 51Cr release assay and intracellular cytokine staining. Human tumor explants
were also evaluated by mass spectrometry for presentation of pIRS2 and pBCAR3
peptides. For the clinical trial, participants with resected stage IIA-IV
melanoma were vaccinated 6 times over 12 weeks with one or both peptides in
incomplete Freund's adjuvant and Hiltonol (poly-ICLC). Adverse events (AEs) were 
coded based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.03, with provision for early study termination if
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rates exceeded 33%. The enrollment target was 12
participants evaluable for immune response to each peptide. T-cell responses were
assessed by interferon-γ ELISpot assay.
RESULTS: pBCAR3 peptides were immunogenic in vivo in mice, and in vitro in normal
human donors, and T-cells specific for pBCAR3126-134 controlled outgrowth of a
tumor xenograft. The pIRS21097-1105 peptide was identified by mass spectrometry
from human hepatocellular carcinoma tumors. In the clinical trial, 15
participants were enrolled. All had grade 1 or 2 treatment-related AEs, but there
were no grade 3-4 AEs, DLTs or deaths on study. T-cell responses were induced to 
the pIRS21097-1105 peptide in 5/12 patients (42%, 90% CI 18% to 68%) and to the
pBCAR3126-134 peptide in 2/12 patients (17%, 90% CI 3% to 44%).
CONCLUSION: This study supports the safety and immunogenicity of vaccines
containing the cancer-associated phosphopeptides pBCAR3126-134 and
pIRS21097-1105, and the data support continued development of immune therapy
targeting phosphopeptides. Future studies will define ways to further enhance the
magnitude and durability of phosphopeptide-specific immune responses.
