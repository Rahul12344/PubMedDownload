The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is an essential component of PML nuclear
bodies (PML NBs) frequently lost in cancer. PML NBs coordinate chromosomal
regions via modification of nuclear proteins that in turn may regulate genes in
the vicinity of these bodies. However, few PML NB-associated genes have been
identified. PML and PML NBs can also regulate mTOR and cell fate decisions in
response to cellular stresses. We now demonstrate that PML depletion in U2OS
cells or TERT-immortalized normal human diploid fibroblasts results in decreased 
expression of the mTOR inhibitor DDIT4 (REDD1). DNA and RNA immuno-FISH reveal
that PML NBs are closely associated with actively transcribed DDIT4 loci,
implicating these bodies in regulation of basal DDIT4 expression. Although PML
silencing did reduce the sensitivity of U2OS cells to metabolic stress induced by
metformin, PML loss did not inhibit the upregulation of DDIT4 in response to
metformin, hypoxia-like (CoCl2) or genotoxic stress. Analysis of publicly
available cancer data also revealed a significant correlation between PML and
DDIT4 expression in several cancer types (e.g. lung, breast, prostate). Thus,
these findings uncover a novel mechanism by which PML loss may contribute to mTOR
activation and cancer progression via dysregulation of basal DDIT4 gene
expression.
