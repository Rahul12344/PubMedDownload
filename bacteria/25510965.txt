The development of new antibiotics faces a severe crisis inter alia owing to a
lack of innovative chemical scaffolds with activities against Gram-negative and
multiresistant pathogens. Herein, we report highly potent novel antibacterial
compounds, the myxobacteria-derived cystobactamids 1-3, which were isolated from 
Cystobacter sp. and show minimum inhibitory concentrations in the low μg mL(-1)
range. We describe the isolation and structure elucidation of three congeners as 
well as the identification and annotation of their biosynthetic gene cluster. By 
studying the self-resistance mechanism in the natural producer organism, the
molecular targets were identified as bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. As
quinolones are largely exhausted as a template for new type II topoisomerase
inhibitors, the cystobactamids offer exciting alternatives to generate novel
antibiotics using medicinal chemistry and biosynthetic engineering.
