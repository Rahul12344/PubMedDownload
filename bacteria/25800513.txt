Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a new type of promising ionic
solvents with a broad range of potential applications. Although their
ecotoxicological profile is still poorly known, DESs are generally regarded as
"green" because they are composed of ammonium salts and H-bond donors (HBDs)
which are considered to be eco-friendly. In this work, cholinium-based DESs
comprised of choline chloride (ChCl) and choline acetate (ChAc) as the salt and
urea (U), acetamide (A), glycerol (G) and ethylene glycol (EG) as the HBD were
evaluated for their toxic effects on different living organisms such as
Escherichia coli (a bacterium), Allium sativum (garlic, a plant) and hydra (an
invertebrate), and their biodegradabilities were assessed by means of closed
bottle tests. These DESs possessed an anti-bacterial property and exhibited
inhibitory effects on the test organisms adopted, depending on the composition
and concentration of the DES. The mechanism for the impact of DESs and their
components on different living organisms can be associated to their interactions 
with the cellular membranes. Not all DESs can be considered readily
biodegradable. By extending the limited knowledge about the toxicity and
biodegradation of this particular solvent family, this investigation on DESs
provides insight into our structure-based understanding of their ecotoxicological
behavior.
