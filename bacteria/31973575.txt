Rationale: Recent studies have revealed that, in critically ill patients, lung
microbiota are altered and correlate with alveolar inflammation. The clinical
significance of altered lung bacteria in critical illness is unknown.Objectives: 
To determine if clinical outcomes of critically ill patients are predicted by
features of the lung microbiome at the time of admission.Methods: We performed a 
prospective, observational cohort study in an ICU at a university hospital. Lung 
microbiota were quantified and characterized using droplet digital PCR and
bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene quantification and sequencing. Primary
predictors were the bacterial burden, community diversity, and community
composition of lung microbiota. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days,
determined at 28 days after admission.Measurements and Main Results: Lungs of 91 
critically ill patients were sampled using miniature BAL within 24 hours of ICU
admission. Patients with increased lung bacterial burden had fewer
ventilator-free days (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.88),
which remained significant when the analysis was controlled for pneumonia and
severity of illness. The community composition of lung bacteria predicted
ventilator-free days (P = 0.003), driven by the presence of gut-associated
bacteria (e.g., species of the Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceae families). 
Detection of gut-associated bacteria was also associated with the presence of
acute respiratory distress syndrome.Conclusions: Key features of the lung
microbiome (bacterial burden and enrichment with gut-associated bacteria) predict
outcomes in critically ill patients. The lung microbiome is an understudied
source of clinical variation in critical illness and represents a novel
therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory failure.
