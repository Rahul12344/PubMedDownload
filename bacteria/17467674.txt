Oligomeric state makes important contributions to the signaling mechanisms of
costimulatory molecules. In this study we address the biological relevance of the
disulfide-linked dimeric structure of CD28. Fluorescence Resonance Energy
Transfer (FRET) demonstrates that removal of the interdomain disulfide bond
(C123) does not interfere with the formation of CD28 oligomers on the cell
surface. Although the C123S mutant shows 40% lower binding affinity to the ligand
B7-1, it is able to costimulate anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production but at a lower
level (150%) compared to the wild-type (270%). Interestingly, binding to B7-2 was
not affected. Thus, the covalently linked dimeric structure of CD28 represents an
important mechanistic determinant for the optimal costimulatory activity in the
immunological synapse.
