OBJECTIVES: With the wide use of heavy metals as feed additives in animal
production, little attention has been paid to heavy metal resistance in
pathogenic bacteria. This study was performed to investigate the presence of
heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) in Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolates 
and its correlation with disinfectant resistance genes (DRGs) and antibiotic
resistance genes (ARGs).
METHODS: HMRGs of 178 E. coli and 294 Salmonella isolated from chicken broiler
farms and retail meat were detected by PCR. Minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) of heavy metals were determined by the broth microdilution method. The
complete genome of E. coli E308, which had indications of multidrug resistance,
was recovered and assembled using third-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: The frequency of different HMRGs in E. coli and Salmonella ranged from
0.60-77.0% and 0.30-87.1%, respectively. MICs of heavy metals for E. coli and
Salmonella ranged widely from ≤12.5 mg/L to 1600 mg/L. Moreover, HMRGs (zntA,
arsB, merA, pcoR, pcoA, pcoC and chrA) were found to be significantly associated 
with one or more DRGs [sugE(c), emrE, mdfA, ydgE/ydgF, qacF, sugE(p) and qacEΔ1] 
and ARGs (sul1, sul2, sul3, tetA, tetB, tetC, blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX) (P <
0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that HMRGs are widely present in E. coli and 
Salmonella isolated from chicken farms and retail meat. The association between
HMRGs with DRGs and ARGs may lead to co-resistance to heavy metals and other
antimicrobial agents.
