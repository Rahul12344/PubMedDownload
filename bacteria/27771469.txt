We aimed to investigate two main polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region
(3'UTR) of the HLA-G gene [14bp insertion/deletion (INS/DEL) and +3142 C>G] and
to assess their impact on the soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) production in patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). This study included 60 patients with relasping-remitting
(RR) MS and 112 healthy donors (HD). Mutations were identified by PCR and
PCR-RFLP, and serum sHLA-G quantification was performed by ELISA. For the 14bp
INS/DEL polymorphism, variants frequencies were similar in patients and controls,
whereas a significant increased frequency of the +3142 G allele was found in MS
patients compared to HD (63.4% vs 52.3%, p=0.04; OR=1.58, 95%CI=1.003-2.48). In
addition, an association was found between MS susceptibility and the haplotypes
regrouping both studied polymorphisms. Indeed, the 14bp DEL/+3142 G haplotype
frequency was significantly increased in MS patients compared to HD (20.8% vs
12.5%, p=0.04, OR=1.84). On the other hand, no associations were detected between
both polymorphisms and clinical parameters, except the lower age of disease onset
(ADO) in patients with the +3142 C/C genotype. Moreover, our study doesn't show
any significant variation of sHLA-G serum levels between patients and controls.
Our findings showed that the +3142 C>G, but not the 14bp INS/DEL, polymorphism
may constitute a genetic susceptibility factor to MS in the Tunisian population. 
However, no association was found between the two polymorphisms and sHLA-G serum 
levels.
