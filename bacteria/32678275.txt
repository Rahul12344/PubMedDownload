Transcription factor binding to genomic DNA is generally prevented by nucleosome 
formation, in which the DNA is tightly wrapped around the histone octamer. In
contrast, pioneer transcription factors efficiently bind their target DNA
sequences within the nucleosome. OCT4 has been identified as a pioneer
transcription factor required for stem cell pluripotency. To study the nucleosome
binding by OCT4, we prepared human OCT4 as a recombinant protein, and
biochemically analyzed its interactions with the nucleosome containing a natural 
OCT4 target, the LIN28B distal enhancer DNA sequence, which contains three
potential OCT4 target sequences. By a combination of chemical mapping and
cryo-electron microscopy single-particle analysis, we mapped the positions of the
three target sequences within the nucleosome. A mutational analysis revealed that
OCT4 preferentially binds its target DNA sequence located near the entry/exit
site of the nucleosome. Crosslinking mass spectrometry consistently showed that
OCT4 binds the nucleosome in the proximity of the histone H3 N-terminal region,
which is close to the entry/exit site of the nucleosome. We also found that the
linker histone H1 competes with OCT4 for the nucleosome binding. These findings
provide important information for understanding the molecular mechanism by which 
OCT4 binds its target DNA in chromatin.
