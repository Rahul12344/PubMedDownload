Stem cell research is currently focused on totipotent stem cells and their
therapeutic potential, however adult stem cells, while restricted to
differentiation within their tissue or origin, also have therapeutic utility.
Transplantation with bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has been used for
curative therapy for decades. More recently, alternative sources of HSC,
particularly those induced to exit marrow or mobilize to peripheral blood by
G-CSF, have become the most widely used hematopoietic graft and show significant 
superiority to marrow HSC. The chemokine/chemokine receptor axis also mobilizes
HSC that occurs more rapidly than with G-CSF. In mice, the HSC and progenitor
cells (HPC) mobilized by the CXCR2 receptor agonist GRObeta can be harvested
within minutes of administration and show significantly lower levels of
apoptosis, enhanced homing to marrow, expression of more activated integrin
receptors and superior repopulation kinetics and more competitive engraftment
than the equivalent cells mobilized by G-CSF. These characteristics suggest that 
chemokine axis-mobilized HSC represent a population of adult stem cells distinct 
from those mobilized by G-CSF, with superior therapeutic potential. It remains to
be determined if the chemokine mobilization axis can be harnessed to mobilize
other populations of unique adult stem cells with clinical utility.
