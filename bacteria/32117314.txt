The non-polymorphic nature of CD1 proteins creates a situation in which T cells
with invariant T cell receptors (TCRs), like CD1d-specific NKT cells, are present
in all humans. CD1b is an abundant protein on human dendritic cells that presents
M. tuberculosis (Mtb) lipid antigens to T cells. Analysis of T cell clones
suggested that semi-invariant TCRs exist in the CD1b system, but their prevalence
in humans is not known. Here we used CD1b tetramers loaded with mycolic acid or
glucose monomycolate to study polyclonal T cells from 150 Peruvian subjects. We
found that CD1b tetramers loaded with mycolic acid or glucose monomycolate
antigens stained TRAV1-2+ GEM T cells or TRBV4-1+ LDN5-like T cells in the
majority of subjects tested, at rates ~10-fold lower than NKT cells. Thus, GEM T 
cells and LDN5-like T cells are a normal part of the human immune system. Unlike 
prior studies measuring MHC- or CD1b-mediated activation, this large-scale
tetramer study found no significant differences in rates of CD1b
tetramer-mycobacterial lipid staining of T cells among subjects with Mtb
exposure, latent Mtb infection or active tuberculosis (TB) disease. In all
subjects, including "uninfected" subjects, CD1b tetramer+ T cells expressed
memory markers at high levels. However, among controls with lower mycobacterial
antigen exposure in Boston, we found significantly lower frequencies of T cells
staining with CD1b tetramers loaded with mycobacterial lipids. These data link
CD1b-specific T cell detection to mycobacterial exposure, but not TB disease
status, which potentially explains differences in outcomes among CD1-based
clinical studies, which used control subjects with low Mtb exposure.
