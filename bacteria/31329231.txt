Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin (S. Dublin) is a bovine-adapted serotype that
can cause serious systemic infections in humans. Despite the increasing
prevalence of human infections and the negative impact on agricultural processes,
little is known about the population structure of the serotype. To this end, we
compiled a manually curated data set comprising of 880 S. Dublin genomes. Core
genome phylogeny and ancestral state reconstruction revealed that region-specific
clades dominate the global population structure of S. Dublin. Strains of S.
Dublin in the UK are genomically distinct from US, Brazilian, and African
strains. The geographical partitioning impacts the composition of the core genome
as well as the ancillary genome. Antibiotic resistance genes are almost
exclusively found in US genomes and are mediated by an IncA/C2 plasmid. Phage
content and the S. Dublin virulence plasmid were strongly conserved in the
serotype. Comparison of S. Dublin to a closely related serotype, S. enterica
serotype Enteritidis, revealed that S. Dublin contains 82 serotype specific genes
that are not found in S. Enteritidis. Said genes encode metabolic functions
involved in the uptake and catabolism of carbohydrates and virulence genes
associated with type VI secretion systems and fimbria assembly respectively.
