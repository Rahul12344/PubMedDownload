Autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) is an established treatment
option in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In this prospective
multicenter study, the effect of infused blood graft cellular composition on
post-transplant outcome was analyzed in 129 NHL patients. Higher graft CD34+ cell
content (>2.5 × 106/kg) correlated with better progression-free survival (PFS)
(p=.009) and overall survival (OS) (p=.004). Higher graft CD34+CD133+CD38- counts
(>0.08 × 106/kg) were also linked with better PFS (p=.03) and OS (p=.004), and
these survival benefits retained in multivariate analyses. Higher infused
CD3+CD4+ cell count (>37 × 106/kg) predicted better PFS (p=.013) and OS (p=.007) 
in multivariate analysis. Autograft cellular composition seems to impact outcome 
in NHL patients. These observations regarding composition of optimal graft in
autologous setting should be validated in an independent patient series or in a
randomized study.
