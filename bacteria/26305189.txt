The relentless advance of drug-resistance among pathogenic microbes, mandates a
search for alternative approaches that will not cause resistance. Photodynamic
inactivation (PDI) involves the combination of nontoxic dyes with harmless
visible light to produce reactive oxygen species that can selectively kill
microbial cells. PDI can be broad-spectrum in nature and can also destroy
microbial cells in biofilms. Many different kinds of nanoparticles have been
studied to potentiate antimicrobial PDI by improving photosensitizer solubility, 
photochemistry, photophysics and targeting. This review will cover photocatalytic
disinfection with titania nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials (fullerenes, carbon
nanotubes and graphene), liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. Natural polymers 
(chitosan and cellulose), gold and silver plasmonic nanoparticles, mesoporous
silica, magnetic and upconverting nanoparticles have all been used for PDI.
