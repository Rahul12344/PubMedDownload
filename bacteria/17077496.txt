Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase, an essential enzyme in the coenzyme A
biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the reversible transfer of an adenylyl group from
ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine, yielding 3'-dephospho-CoA and pyrophosphate.
Enterococcus faecalis PPAT has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion
with a C-terminal purification tag and crystallized at 297 K using a reservoir
solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium HEPES pH 7.5, 0.8 M sodium dihydrogen
phosphate and 0.8 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate. X-ray diffraction data were
collected to 2.70 A at 100 K. The crystals belong to the primitive tetragonal
space group P4(1) (or P4(3)), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 160.81, c =
225.68 A. Four copies of the hexameric molecule are likely to be present in the
asymmetric unit, giving a crystal volume per protein weight (V(M)) of 3.08 A(3)
Da(-1) and a solvent content of 60.1%.
