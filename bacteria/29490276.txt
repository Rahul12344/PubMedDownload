Treatment of human pancreatic non-endocrine tissue with Bone Morphogenetic
Protein 7 (BMP-7) leads to the formation of glucose-responsive β-like cells.
Here, we show that BMP-7 acts on extrainsular cells expressing PDX1 and the BMP
receptor activin-like kinase 3 (ALK3/BMPR1A). In vitro lineage tracing indicates 
that ALK3+ cell populations are multipotent. PDX1+/ALK3+ cells are absent from
islets but prominently represented in the major pancreatic ducts and pancreatic
duct glands. We identified the purinergic receptor P2Y1 (P2RY1) as a surrogate
surface marker for PDX1. Sorted P2RY1+/ALK3bright+ cells form BMP-7-expandable
colonies characterized by NKX6.1 and PDX1 expression. Unlike the negative
fraction controls, these colonies can be differentiated into multiple pancreatic 
lineages upon BMP-7 withdrawal. RNA-seq further corroborates the progenitor-like 
nature of P2RY1+/ALK3bright+ cells and their multilineage differentiation
potential. Our studies confirm the existence of progenitor cells in the adult
human pancreas and suggest a specific anatomical location within the ductal and
glandular networks.
