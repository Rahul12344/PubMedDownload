The AlkB protein is a repair enzyme that uses an Î±-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent
mechanism to repair alkyl DNA adducts. AlkB has been reported to repair highly
susceptible substrates, such as 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine, more
efficiently in ss-DNA than in ds-DNA. Here, we tested the repair of weaker AlkB
substrates 1-methylguanine and 3-methylthymine and found that AlkB prefers to
repair them in ds-DNA. We also discovered that AlkB and its human homologues,
ABH2 and ABH3, are able to repair the aforementioned adducts when the adduct is
present in a mismatched base pair. These observations demonstrate the strong
adaptability of AlkB toward repairing various adducts in different environments.
