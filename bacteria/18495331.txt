Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder characterized by a
progressive bone marrow (BM) failure and susceptibility to myeloid leukemia.
Genetic correction using gene-transfer technology is one potential therapy. A
major hurdle in applying this technology in FA patients is the inability of
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize sufficient numbers of
hematopoietic stem (HSC)/progenitor cells (HPC) from the BM to the peripheral
blood. Whether the low number of CD34(+) cells is a result of BM hypoplasia or an
inability of G-CSF to adequately mobilize FA HSC/HPC remains incompletely
understood. Here we use competitive repopulation of lethally irradiated primary
and secondary recipients to show that in two murine models of FA, AMD3100
synergizes with G-CSF resulting in a mobilization of HSC, whereas G-CSF alone
fails to mobilize stem cells even in the absence of hypoplasia.
