An unsolved mystery in biology concerns the link between enzyme catalysis and
protein motions. Comparison between isotopically labelled "heavy" dihydrofolate
reductases and their natural-abundance counterparts has suggested that the
coupling of protein motions to the chemistry of the catalysed reaction is
minimised in the case of hydride transfer. In alcohol dehydrogenases, unnatural, 
bulky substrates that induce additional electrostatic rearrangements of the
active site enhance coupled motions. This finding could provide a new route to
engineering enzymes with altered substrate specificity, because amino acid
residues responsible for dynamic coupling with a given substrate present as
hotspots for mutagenesis. Detailed understanding of the biophysics of enzyme
catalysis based on insights gained from analysis of "heavy" enzymes might
eventually allow routine engineering of enzymes to catalyse reactions of choice.
