Objectives: Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a species of CoNS, has become an
important hospital pathogen because of increasing resistance to β-lactam
antibiotics such as methicillin and oxacillin. Methicillin resistance is mainly
due to the acquisition of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec
(SCCmec). Little is known about the structure of SCCmec in methicillin- or
oxacillin-resistant CoNS.
Methods: WGS was performed to determine the structure of SCCmec elements of two
clinical S. lugdunensis isolates: CMUH-22 and CMUH-25.
Results: These elements were found to be flanked by DRs and IRs with unique
mosaic structures and a common integration site in the 3' end of the rlmH gene.
The sequences of the regions located between rlmH and the ISSau4-like transposase
genes of both elements were similar to those of SCCmec Vt of Staphylococcus
aureus PM1. The SCCmec (type V, 5C2&4) of CMUH-25 harboured a novel ccrC complex 
and a C2-like mec complex in opposite orientations, similar to the type V SCCmec 
of S. aureus WIS. The sequences of the ccrA4B4 genes and J1 and J2 regions of
CMUH-25 were similar to those of the SCC element of Staphylococcus haemolyticus
NCTC 11042. In contrast, portions of the sequence of the J1 region of type Vt
(5C2) SCCmec in strain CMUH-22 were highly similar to portions of those of
Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A and the composite SCCmec type V of S. aureus
WAMRSA40.
Conclusions: These observations suggest that the SCCmec elements of CMUH-25 and
CMUH-22 evolved separately and assembled through different recombination events.
