Anthrax toxin-receptor interactions are critical for toxin delivery to the host
cell cytoplasm. This review summarizes what is known about the molecular details 
of the protective antigen (PA) toxin subunit interaction with either the ANTXR1
and ANTXR2 cellular receptors, and how receptor-type can dictate the low pH
threshold of PA pore formation. The roles played by cellular factors in
regulating the endocytosis of toxin-receptor complexes is also discussed.
