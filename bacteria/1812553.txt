Bacteriological confirmation of the presence of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in
patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) by means of the express method was
achieved only in 15.1% of the cases and the positive growth of the culture was
observed only in 12.1%. Streptococci isolated from the patients showed a low
IgG-Fc receptor activity just as in the negative control. The blood serum of
patients exhibited the presence of antibodies to 18 OF-serotypes among which
serotypes 2, 4, 22, 28, 48, 68, 75, 77, 78, PT 2841 prevailed; their content
fluctuated from 12.5 to 48.4%. There were no differences between the nature of
distribution of the given antibodies depending on the presence and level of ASL-O
in the blood and the presence of concomitant chronic tonsillitis. Antibodies to
IgG in titres 1:10-1:40 were revealed in the blood of only 18.1% of the patients;
there was some dependence of the frequency of their detection on the markedness
of carditis and the presence of cardiac defects.
