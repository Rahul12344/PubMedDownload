Recent convincing data have shown that naturally occurring CD8(+)CD122(+) T cells
are also regulatory T cells. Paradoxically, CD8(+)CD122(+) T cells have been well
described as memory T cells. Given their critical role in tolerance versus
long-term immunity, it is important to reconcile this profound dichotomy. In this
study, we reported that CD8(+)CD122(+) T cells contain both programmed death-1
(PD-1)(-) and PD-1(+) populations. It was CD8(+)CD122(+)PD-1(+) T cells, but not 
their PD-1(-) counterparts, that suppressed T cell responses in vitro and in
vivo. This suppression was largely dependent on their production of IL-10.
Moreover, the costimulatory signaling of both CD28 and PD-1 is required for their
optimal IL-10 production. In contrast, Ag-specific CD8(+)CD122(+)PD-1(-) T cells 
were bona fide memory T cells. Thus, CD8(+)CD122(+) T cells can be either
regulatory T or memory T cells, depending on their PD-1 expression and Ag
specificity. This study reconciles previously contradictory findings and has
important implications for tolerance induction.
