Despite the use of multidrug therapy, leprosy remains endemic in some countries. 
The association of several human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and gene
polymorphisms with leprosy has been demonstrated in many populations, but the
major immune contributors associated to the spectrum of leprosy have not been
defined yet. In this study, genotyping of HLA-A, -B, -DR, and -DQ alleles was
performed in leprosy patients (n = 113) and control subjects (n = 117) from the
region with the highest incidence for the disease in México. The odds of
developing leprosy and lepromatous subtype were 2.12- and 2.74-fold higher in
carriers of HLA-A*28, and 2.48- and 4.14-fold higher for leprosy and dimorphic
subtype in carriers of DQB1*06. Interestingly, DQB1*07 was overrepresented in
healthy individuals, compared to patients with leprosy (OR = 0.08) and the
lepromatous subtype (OR = 0.06). These results suggest that HLA-A*28 is a marker 
for predisposition to leprosy and the lepromatous subtype and DQB1*06 to leprosy 
and the dimorphic subtype, while DQB1*07 might be a resistance marker in this
Mestizo population.
