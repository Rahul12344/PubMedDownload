Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which involves in various
cell life activities. Other studies and our report showed that the Notch
signaling plays very important role in follicle development in mammalian ovaries.
In luteal cells, Notch ligand, delta-like ligand 4, is involved in normal luteal 
vasculature. In this study, murine luteal cells were cultured in vitro and
treated with Notch signaling inhibitors, L-658,458 and
N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycinet-butyl ester (DAPT). We
found that L-658,458 and DAPT treatment decrease basal and human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated progesterone secretion. On the contrary,
overexpression of intracellular domain of Notch3 increased basal and
hCG-stimulated progesterone secretion. Further studies demonstrated that Notch
signaling regulated the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and 
CYP11A, 2 key enzymes for progesterone synthesis. In conclusion, Notch signaling 
plays important role in regulating progesterone secretion in murine luteal cells.
