Rasal, belonging to the GAP1 subfamily of Ras GTPase-activating proteins
(RasGAPs) with dual RasGAP/RapGAP specificity, is epigenetically silenced in
several tumor types. Surprisingly, the isolated protein has GAP activity on Rap
but not on Ras. Its membrane recruitment is regulated by interaction with calcium
and lipids, which simultaneously induces its RasGAP activity through a yet
unknown mechanism. Here we show that the interaction of Rasal with membranes
induces Rasal RasGAP activity by spatial and conformational regulation, although 
it does not have any effect on its RapGAP activity. Not only is colocalization of
Rasal and Ras in the membrane essential for RasGAP activation, but direct and
Ca-dependent interaction between the tandem C2 domains of Rasal and lipids of the
membrane is also required. Whereas the C2A domain binds specifically
phosphatidylserine, the C2B domain interacts with several phosphoinositol lipids.
Finally we show, that similar to the C2 domains of synaptotagmins, the Rasal
tandem C2 domains are able to sense and induce membrane curvature by the
insertion of hydrophobic loops into the membrane.
