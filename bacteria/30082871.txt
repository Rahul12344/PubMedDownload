Translation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to human therapeutics holds high promise.
However, specificity remains a concern especially when modifying stem cell
populations. We show that existing rationally engineered Cas9 high-fidelity
variants have reduced on-target activity when using the therapeutically relevant 
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery method. Therefore, we devised an unbiased
bacterial screen to isolate variants that retain activity in the RNP format.
Introduction of a single point mutation, p.R691A, in Cas9 (high-fidelity (HiFi)
Cas9) retained the high on-target activity of Cas9 while reducing off-target
editing. HiFi Cas9 induces robust AAV6-mediated gene targeting at five
therapeutically relevant loci (HBB, IL2RG, CCR5, HEXB, and TRAC) in human CD34+
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as primary T cells. We
also show that HiFi Cas9 mediates high-level correction of the sickle cell
disease (SCD)-causing p.E6V mutation in HSPCs derived from patients with SCD. We 
anticipate that HiFi Cas9 will have wide utility for both basic science and
therapeutic genome-editing applications.
