BACKGROUND: The function of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in host defense against
pathogens, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is poorly understood. To
investigate the role of TLR2 during mycobacterial infection, we analyzed the
response of tlr2 zebrafish mutant larvae to infection with Mycobacterium marinum 
(Mm), a close relative to Mtb, as a model for tuberculosis. We measured infection
phenotypes and transcriptome responses using RNA deep sequencing in mutant and
control larvae.
RESULTS: tlr2 mutant embryos at 2 dpf do not show differences in numbers of
macrophages and neutrophils compared to control embryos. However, we found
substantial changes in gene expression in these mutants, particularly in
metabolic pathways, when compared with the heterozygote tlr2+/- control. At
4 days after Mm infection, the total bacterial burden and the presence of
extracellular bacteria were higher in tlr2-/- larvae than in tlr2+/-, or tlr2+/+ 
larvae, whereas granuloma numbers were reduced, showing a function of Tlr2 in
zebrafish host defense. RNAseq analysis of infected tlr2-/- versus tlr2+/- shows 
that the number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in response to infection
was greatly diminished in tlr2 mutants by at least 2 fold and 10 fold,
respectively. Analysis of the transcriptome data and qPCR validation shows that
Mm infection of tlr2 mutants leads to decreased mRNA levels of genes involved in 
inflammation and immune responses, including il1b, tnfb, cxcl11aa/ac, fosl1a, and
cebpb. Furthermore, RNAseq analyses revealed that the expression of genes for Maf
family transcription factors, vitamin D receptors, and Dicps proteins is altered 
in tlr2 mutants with or without infection. In addition, the data indicate a
function of Tlr2 in the control of induction of cytokines and chemokines, such as
the CXCR3-CXCL11 signaling axis.
CONCLUSION: The transcriptome and infection burden analyses show a function of
Tlr2 as a protective factor against mycobacteria. Transcriptome analysis revealed
tlr2-specific pathways involved in Mm infection, which are related to responses
to Mtb infection in human macrophages. Considering its dominant function in
control of transcriptional processes that govern defense responses and
metabolism, the TLR2 protein can be expected to be also of importance for other
infectious diseases and interactions with the microbiome.
