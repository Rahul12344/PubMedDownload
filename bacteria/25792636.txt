Staphylococcus aureus has evolved as an important cause of pneumonia in both
hospital and community settings. Staphylococcal lung infection can lead to
overwhelming pulmonary inflammation. During infection, neutrophils release
complexes of myeloid-related protein (MRP)8 and MRP14 (MRP8/14). MRP8/14 has been
shown to exert pro-inflammatory and chemotactic activity, and to assist in the
killing of S. aureus. In the current study we sought to determine the role of
MRP8/14 in the host response during S. aureus pneumonia.Pneumonia was induced in 
wildtype and MRP14-deficient mice (mice unable to form MRP8/14) by intranasal
inoculation of 1×10(7) CFU of S. aureus USA300. Mice were sacrificed at 6, 24, 48
or 72 h after infection for analyses.S. aureus pneumonia was associated with a
strong rise in MRP8/14 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue.
Surprisingly, MRP14 deficiency had a limited effect on bacterial clearance and
was associated with increased cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and
aggravated lung histopathology. MRP14 deficiency in addition was associated with 
a diminished transmigration of neutrophils into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at
late time-points after infection together with reduced release of
nucleosomes.MRP8/14 serves in an unexpected protective role for the lung in
staphylococcal pneumonia.
