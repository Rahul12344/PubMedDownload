We continued characterization of the Legionella pneumophila hel locus.
Mutagenesis and DNA sequencing identified three genes similar to the czc and cnr 
loci of Alcaligenes eutrophus and the ncc locus of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. On
the basis of their similarity to these loci, we designated the L. pneumophila
genes helC, helB, and helA. Mutations in the hel genes led to reduced
cytopathicity towards U937 cells, although the mutant strains did not appear
defective in other assays of virulence. Transcription of the hel locus was
induced by the intracellular environment but was not induced by any of a variety 
of in vitro stress conditions. The function of the hel gene products remains to
be determined.
