Hydration scanning tunneling microscopy is based on the electrical conductivity
of molecularly thin water layers which adsorb to the sample surfaces in a humid
atmosphere. It allows reliable imaging of biological specimens and even
insulators, provided they are hydrophilic. Here, we present results obtained with
linearized plasmid DNA on mica and a bacterial surface protein layer (the HPI
layer). A width of 3 nm was measured for the DNA molecules and a quasi-periodic
structure along the molecules with a repeat distance of about 5 nm was observed. 
We show that-depending on the tunneling voltage-there are two different imaging
modes for the DNA samples: at higher voltages, real tunneling or field emission
is responsible for the charge transfer between tip and sample. In contrast, at
lower voltages we found indications of a water meniscus between tip and surface. 
The HPI layer, however, seems to be imaged at most voltages without a water
meniscus.
