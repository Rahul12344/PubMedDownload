Cloning and engineering of natural product biosynthetic pathways followed by
heterologous expression in a tractable host is a widely used approach for
expression and genetic modification of microbial secondary metabolites. Herein,
we employed ccdB counterselection combined with oligonucleotide-mediated
recombineering to efficiently create point mutations in a complex nonribosomal
peptide synthetase (NRPS) from Photorabdus luminescens directing the biosynthesis
of luminmides. After in depth analysis of the luminmide production profile from
the native NRPS, single and double point mutations were rationally constructed
within the adenylation (A) domain from NRPS module 3 which turned out to have a
broad substrate tolerance. Expression of mutated versions of the 15.6 kb NRPS
gene plu3263 in E. coli led to alterations in luminmide production profiles and
allowed to direct the biosynthesis towards certain derivatives. These results
demonstrate the suitability of counterselection recombineering for site-directed 
mutagenesis of complex expression constructs, e.g., genes encoding NRPS
biosynthetic pathways in multi-copy plasmids.
