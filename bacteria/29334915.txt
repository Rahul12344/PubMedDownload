BACKGROUND: Vaccination of mice with tumors treated with Doxorubicin promotes a T
cell immunity that relies on dendritic cell (DC) activation and is responsible
for tumor control in vaccinated animals. Despite Doxorubicin in combination with 
Cyclophosphamide (A/C) is widely used to treat breast cancer patients, the
stimulating effect of A/C on T and APC compartments and its correlation with
patient's clinical response remains to be proved.
METHODS: In this prospective study, we designed an in vitro system to monitor
various immunological readouts in PBMCs obtained from a total of 17 breast cancer
patients before, and after neoadjuvant anti-tumor therapy with A/C.
RESULTS: The results show that before treatment, T cells and DCs, exhibit a
marked unresponsiveness to in vitro stimulus: whereas T cells exhibit poor TCR
internalization and limited expression of CD154 in response to anti-CD3/CD28/CD2 
stimulation, DCs secrete low levels of IL-12p70 and limited CD83 expression in
response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Notably, after treatment the
responsiveness of T and APC compartments was recovered, and furthermore, this
recovery correlated with patients' residual cancer burden stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results let us to argue that the model used here to monitor the 
T and APC compartments is suitable to survey the recovery of immune surveillance 
and to predict tumor response during A/C chemotherapy.
