The guanine nucleotide binding protein Rab8A controls the final steps of
exocytosis in mammalian cells. It has been implicated in the regulation of apical
protein localization in intestinal epithelial cells and ciliary biogenesis. The
in vitro structural and biochemical characterization of Rab8A and its interaction
with regulator and effector molecules has been hampered by its insolubility in
Escherichia coli expression systems. The conventional refolding procedure is
laborious and yields only minute amounts of C-terminally truncated Rab8A
(Rab8A(1-183): amino acids 1-183), not the full-length protein. Here, we report a
method of expressing soluble, hexahistidine-tagged full-length human Rab8A from
E. coli. The Rab8A gene was codon-optimized and coexpressed with bacterial GroEL 
and GroES chaperones. After two-step purification by Ni(2+) affinity
chromatography and gel filtration, Rab8A was obtained at a yield of 4 mg protein 
per 1L of bacterial cell culture and a purity of >95%. The resultant protein was 
functionally active, as determined by GTPase activity and its interaction with
the nucleotide exchange factor MSS4.
