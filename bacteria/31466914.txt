BACKGROUND: The dismal survival of glioblastoma (GBM) patients urgently calls for
the development of new treatments. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells are 
an attractive strategy, but preclinical and clinical studies in GBM have shown
that heterogeneous expression of the antigens targeted so far causes tumor
escape, highlighting the need for the identification of new targets. We explored 
if B7-H3 is a valuable target for CAR-T cells in GBM.
METHODS: We compared mRNA expression of antigens in GBM using TCGA data, and
validated B7-H3 expression by immunohistochemistry. We then tested the antitumor 
activity of B7-H3-redirected CAR-T cells against GBM cell lines and
patient-derived GBM neurospheres in vitro and in xenograft murine models.
FINDINGS: B7-H3 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in GBM relative to normal
brain in all GBM subtypes. Of the 46 specimens analyzed by immunohistochemistry, 
76% showed high B7-H3 expression, 22% had detectable, but low B7-H3 expression
and 2% were negative, as was normal brain. All 20 patient-derived neurospheres
showed ubiquitous B7-H3 expression. B7-H3-redirected CAR-T cells effectively
targeted GBM cell lines and neurospheres in vitro and in vivo. No significant
differences were found between CD28 and 4-1BB co-stimulation, although
CD28-co-stimulated CAR-T cells released more inflammatory cytokines.
INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated that B7-H3 is highly expressed in GBM specimens
and neurospheres that contain putative cancer stem cells, and that
B7-H3-redirected CAR-T cells can effectively control tumor growth. Therefore,
B7-H3 represents a promising target in GBM. FUND: Alex's Lemonade Stand
