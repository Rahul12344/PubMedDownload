The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) family contains 17 members in humans,
sharing a PARP domain to transfer ADP-ribose groups to target proteins to trigger
ADP-ribosylation. The roles of PARPs have evolved from DNA damage repair to
diverse biological processes, such as gene transcription, cellular stress
response, etc. Recently, seminal studies have demonstrated the critical roles of 
PAPRs in antiviral innate immunity. PARPs catalyze ADP-ribosylation, a
fundamental post-translational modification, using NAD+ as a substrate.
ADP-ribosylation can occur either as mono- or poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which is
initially linked to DNA damage repair, as exemplified by PARP1. Recent advances
in host antiviral immunity demonstrated that several PARPs, such as PARP9, 11,
12, 13, 14, etc., have broad-spectrum antiviral activities that are independent
of their ADP-ribosylation.
