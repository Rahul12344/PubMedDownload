The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a very unstable protein. AhR binds to the 
molecular chaperone complex (HSP90-p23-XAP2) to maintain a stable structure in
the cytoplasm. After binding to ligands, such as dioxin, AhR translocates from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus with a molecular chaperone complex. The protein
forms a heterodimer with Arnt after nuclear transfer, functions as a
transcription factor by binding to a xenobiotic responsive element (XRE), and
induces the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). Because of the unstable protein,
expression of the full-length AhR in the E. coli expression system is very
difficult. Many studies investigated AhR using AhR domains in vitro. We expressed
and purified the human full-length AhR in E. coli expression system. Furthermore,
specific antibodies were prepared. Purified full-length AhR could bind to ligand.
In the presence of ligand, α-helix and random coil of AhR increased and β-sheet
decreased on CD spectrum. Full-length AhR could bind to HSP90, XAP2 and p23 in
the presence or absence of ligand. We now show the biochemical properties of
full-length AhR.
