Myxopyronins and corallopyronins are structurally related α-pyrone antibiotics
from myxobacteria. They are thought to represent a highly promising compound
class for the development of broad-spectrum antibacterial therapeutic agents,
because of their ability to inhibit RNA polymerase through interaction with the
"switch region", a recently identified novel drug target. Here we describe the
identification and characterization of the myxopyronin biosynthetic pathway from 
Myxococcus fulvus Mx f50. A detailed comparison with the recently identified
corallopyronin biosynthetic pathway revealed the genetic and biochemical basis,
thus explaining the observed structural differences between the two natural
product families. Directed mutagenesis procedures for M. fulvus Mx f50 were
developed to enable functional studies and pathway modifications. Our work
provided new insights into myxopyronin biosynthesis and led to the production of 
a novel and unexpected myxopyronin derivative.
