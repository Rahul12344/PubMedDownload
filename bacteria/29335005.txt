BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health challenge.
Metagenomics allows analyzing the presence and dynamics of "resistomes" (the
ensemble of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance in a given microbiome) in
disparate microbial ecosystems. However, the low sensitivity and specificity of
available metagenomic methods preclude the detection of minority populations
(often present below their detection threshold) and/or the identification of
allelic variants that differ in the resulting phenotype. Here, we describe a
novel strategy that combines targeted metagenomics using last generation
in-solution capture platforms, with novel bioinformatics tools to establish a
standardized framework that allows both quantitative and qualitative analyses of 
resistomes.
METHODS: We developed ResCap, a targeted sequence capture platform based on
SeqCapEZ (NimbleGene) technology, which includes probes for 8667 canonical
resistance genes (7963 antibiotic resistance genes and 704 genes conferring
resistance to metals or biocides), and 2517 relaxase genes (plasmid markers) and 
78,600 genes homologous to the previous identified targets (47,806 for
antibiotics and 30,794 for biocides or metals). Its performance was compared with
metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) for 17 fecal samples (9 humans, 8 swine).
ResCap significantly improves MSS to detect "gene abundance" (from 2.0 to 83.2%) 
and "gene diversity" (26 versus 14.9 genes unequivocally detected per sample per 
million of reads; the number of reads unequivocally mapped increasing up
to 300-fold by using ResCap), which were calculated using novel bioinformatic
tools. ResCap also facilitated the analysis of novel genes potentially involved
in the resistance to antibiotics, metals, biocides, or any combination thereof.
CONCLUSIONS: ResCap, the first targeted sequence capture, specifically developed 
to analyze resistomes, greatly enhances the sensitivity and specificity of
available metagenomic methods and offers the possibility to analyze genes related
to the selection and transfer of antimicrobial resistance (biocides, heavy
metals, plasmids). The model opens the possibility to study other complex
microbial systems in which minority populations play a relevant role.
