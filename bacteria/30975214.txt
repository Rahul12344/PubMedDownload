Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly isolated pathogen from clinical bovine
mastitis samples and a difficult pathogen to combat. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
are multipotent progenitor cells equipped with a variety of factors that inhibit 
bacterial growth. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro
antibacterial potential against S. aureus of conditioned medium (CM) from MSC
derived from fetal bovine bone marrow (BM-MSC) and adipose tissue (AT-MSC).
BM-MSC, AT-MSC and fetal fibroblasts (FB) cultures were activated by infection
with S. aureus. Bacterial growth was evaluated in presence of CM, concentrated CM
(CCM), activated CM (ACM) and concentrated ACM (CACM) from BM-MSC, AT-MSC and FB.
Gene expression of β-defensin 4A (bBD-4A), NK-lysine 1 (NK1), cathelicidin 2
(CATHL2), hepcidin (HEP) and indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) and protein
expression of bBD-4A were determined in activated and non-activated cells. The
majority of BM-MSC and AT-MSC expressed CD73, Oct4 and Nanog, and were negative
for CD34. Growth of S. aureus decreased when it was exposed to CM from BM-MSC,
AT-MSC and FB. Moreover, growth of S. aureus in CCM, ACM and CACM was lower
compared to controls of CM from BM-MSC and AT-MSC. Activated AT-MSC increased
mRNA levels of bBD4A and NK1, and protein levels of bBD4A in CM. Thus, CM from
fetal bovine BM-MSC and AT-MSC has the capacity to reduce in average ~30% of S.
aureus relative growth under in vitro conditions. The in vitro antibacterial
effect of fetal bovine MSC may be mediated by bBD4A and NK1 activity.
