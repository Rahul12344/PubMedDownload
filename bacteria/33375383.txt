Comprehensive scientific data provide evidence that isolated phytochemicals or
whole plant foods may beneficially modify carcinogenesis. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the oncostatic activities of Rhus coriaria L. (sumac) using
animal models (rat and mouse), and cell lines of breast carcinoma. R. coriaria
(as a powder) was administered through the diet at two concentrations (low dose: 
0.1% (w/w) and high dose: 1 % (w/w)) for the duration of the experiment in a
syngeneic 4T1 mouse and chemically-induced rat mammary carcinoma models. After
autopsy, histopathological and molecular analyses of tumor samples in rodents
were performed. Moreover, in vitro analyses using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
conducted. The dominant metabolites present in tested R. coriaria methanolic
extract were glycosides of gallic acid (possible gallotannins). In the mouse
model, R. coriaria at a higher dose (1%) significantly decreased tumor volume by 
27% when compared to controls. In addition, treated tumors showed significant
dose-dependent decrease in mitotic activity index by 36.5% and 51% in comparison 
with the control group. In the chemoprevention study using rats, R. coriaria at a
higher dose significantly reduced the tumor incidence by 20% and in lower dose
non-significantly reduced tumor frequency by 29% when compared to controls.
Evaluations of the mechanism of oncostatic action using valid clinical markers
demonstrated several positive alterations in rat tumor cells after the treatment 
with R. coriaria. In this regard, histopathological analysis of treated tumor
specimens showed robust dose-dependent decrease in the ratio of high-/low-grade
carcinomas by 66% and 73% compared to controls. In treated rat carcinomas, we
found significant caspase-3, Bax, and Bax/Bcl-2 expression increases; on the
other side, a significant down-regulation of Bcl-2, Ki67, CD24, ALDH1, and EpCam 
expressions and MDA levels. When compared to control specimens, evaluation of
epigenetic alterations in rat tumor cells in vivo showed significant
dose-dependent decrease in lysine methylation status of H3K4m3 and H3K9m3 and
dose-dependent increase in lysine acetylation in H4K16ac levels (H4K20m3 was not 
changed) in treated groups. However, only in lower dose of sumac were significant
decreases in the expression of oncogenic miR210 and increase of tumor-suppressive
miR145 (miR21, miR22, and miR155 were not changed) observed. Finally, only in
lower sumac dose, significant decreases in methylation status of three out of
five gene promoters-ATM, PTEN, and TIMP3 (PITX2 and RASSF1 promoters were not
changed). In vitro evaluations using methanolic extract of R. coriaria showed
significant anticancer efficacy in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (using Resazurin,
cell cycle, annexin V/PI, caspase-3/7, Bcl-2, PARP, and mitochondrial membrane
potential analyses). In conclusion, sumac demonstrated significant oncostatic
activities in rodent models of breast carcinoma that were validated by
mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro.
