PURPOSE: Natural killer T (NKT) cells are important mediators of antitumor immune
responses. We have previously shown that ovarian cancers shed the ganglioside
GD3, which inhibits NKT-cell activation. Ovarian cancers also secrete high levels
of VEGF. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that VEGF production by 
ovarian cancers suppresses NKT-cell-mediated antitumor responses.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To investigate the effects of VEGF on CD1d-mediated NKT-cell
activation, a conditioned media model was established, wherein the supernatants
from ovarian cancer cell lines (OV-CAR-3 and SK-OV-3) were used to treat
CD1d-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APC) and cocultured with NKT
hybridomas. Ovarian cancer-associated VEGF was inhibited by treatment with
bevacizumab and genistein; conditioned medium was collected, and CD1d-mediated
NKT-cell responses were assayed by ELISA.
RESULTS: Ovarian cancer tissue and ascites contain lymphocytic infiltrates,
suggesting that immune cells traffic to tumors, but are then inhibited by
immunosuppressive molecules within the tumor microenvironment. OV-CAR-3 and
SK-OV-3 cell lines produce high levels of VEGF and GD3. Pretreatment of APCs with
ascites or conditioned medium from OV-CAR-3 and SK-OV-3 blocked CD1d-mediated
NKT-cell activation. Inhibition of VEGF resulted in a concomitant reduction in
GD3 levels and restoration of NKT-cell responses.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that VEGF inhibition restores NKT-cell function in an in
vitro ovarian cancer model. These studies suggest that the combination of immune 
modulation with antiangiogenic treatment has therapeutic potential in ovarian
cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(16); 4249-58. ©2016 AACR.
