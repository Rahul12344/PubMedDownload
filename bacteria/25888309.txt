BACKGROUND: Inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM) is a common debilitating
disease with poor prognosis that often leads to heart failure and may require
heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate sera and biopsy
samples from chronic iDCM patients, and to investigate molecular mechanism
associated with left ventricular remodeling and disease progression in order to
improve therapeutic intervention.
METHODS: Patients were divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory DCM groups 
according to the immunohistochemical expression of inflammatory infiltrates
markers: T-lymphocytes (CD3), active-memory T lymphocyte (CD45Ro) and macrophages
(CD68). The inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis and fibrosis were investigated by
ELISA, chemiluminescent, immunohistochemical and histological assays.
RESULTS: The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly elevated in iDCM
sera (3.3 vs. 10.98 μg/ml; P < 0.05). Sera levels of caspase-9, -8 and -3 had
increased 6.24-, 3.1- and 3.62-fold, (P < 0.05) and only slightly (1.3-, 1.22-
and 1.03-fold) in biopsies. Significant release of Hsp60 in sera (0.0419 vs.
0.36 ng/mg protein; P < 0.05) suggested a mechanistic involvement of mitochondria
in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The significant MMP9/TIMP1 upregulation in biopsies
(0.1931 - 0.476, P < 0.05) and correlation with apoptosis markers show its
involvement in initiation of cell death and ECM degradation. A slight activation 
of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the release of hsTnT might support the
progression of chronic iDCM.
CONCLUSIONS: Data of this study show that significant increase of IL-6,
MMP9/TIMP1 and caspases-9, -8, -3 in sera corresponds to molecular mechanisms
dominating in chronic iDCM myocardium. The initial apoptotic pathway was more
activated by the intramyocardial inflammation and might be associated with
extrinsic apoptotic pathway through the pro-apoptotic Bax. The activated
intrinsic form of myocardial apoptosis, absence of necrosis and decreased
fibrosis are most typical characteristics of chronic iDCM. Clinical use of
anti-inflammatory drugs together with specific anti-apoptotic treatment might
improve the efficiency of therapies against chronic iDCM before heart failure
occurs.
