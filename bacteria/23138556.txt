Prosthesis loosening is becoming more and more important due to increasing
numbers of primary arthroplasty. Especially in patients suffering from rheumatoid
arthritis this is a major topic due to younger age and multiple affected joints. 
A carefully performed diagnostic regimen is essential for ruling out septic
loosening of the prosthesis. Preoperative planning is crucial for revision
surgery. Revision implants should be available as back-up. Revision arthroplasty 
is a technically and economically demanding procedure. Costs for revision surgery
are much higher than for primary arthroplasty due to longer hospital stay,
intensive care, microbiology, histology, diagnostic imaging, implants and
antibiotics. Revision arthroplasty should be performed in highly specialized
centers.
