BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is used as a
first-line treatment option for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) with the weaknesses
of incomplete ablation, tumor recurrence, and inferior outcomes. To overcome this
limitation, we proposed to develop sunitinib-RFA integrated therapy with a
potential of activating anti-HCC immune response.
METHODS: Using our unique murine model, we developed a novel RFA platform with a 
modified human cardiac RF generator. Therapeutic efficacy of sunitinib-RFA
combined treatment in HCC was tested in this platform. Tumor progression was
monitored by MRI; tumor necrosis and apoptosis were detected by H&E and terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; immune reaction was defined 
by flow cytometry; and signaling molecules were examined with real-time PCR
(qPCR), western blot, and immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: A significantly reduced tumor growth and extended lift span were
observed in the mice receiving combined treatment with RFA and sunitinib. This
combined treatment significantly increased the frequency of CD8+ T cell, memory
CD8+ T cell, and dendritic cells (DCs); decreased the frequency of regulatory T
cells; and activated tumor-specific antigen (TSA) immune response in tumor
microenvironment. We found that RFA caused PD-1 upregulation in tumor-infiltrated
T cells by boosting hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, which was
suppressed by sunitinib treatment. We have also demonstrated that sunitinib
suppressed VEGF's effect in enhancing PD-L1 expression in DCs and attenuated
heat-sink effect. The results indicate that RFA induced tumor destruction and
release of in situ TSAs which can activate a tumoricidal immune response in
sunitinib-treated mice, significantly improving anti-HCC therapeutic efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib enables RFA-released in situ TSA to ignite an effective
anti-tumor immune response by suppressing HGF and VEGF signaling pathways.
Sunitinib-RFA as a synergistic therapeutic approach significantly suppresses HCC 
growth.
