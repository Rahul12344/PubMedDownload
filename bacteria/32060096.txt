The metalloprotease ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) is a key
regulator of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), and 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. ADAM17 maturation and function
depend on the seven-membrane-spanning inactive rhomboid-like proteins 1 and 2
(iRhom1/2 or Rhbdf1/2). Most studies to date have focused on overexpressed iRhom1
and -2, so only little is known about the properties of the endogenous proteins. 
Here, we show that endogenous iRhom1 and -2 can be cell surface-biotinylated on
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs), revealing that endogenous iRhom1 and -2
proteins are present on the cell surface and that iRhom2 also is present on the
surface of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary bone marrow-derived macrophages.
Interestingly, very little, if any, iRhom2 was detectable in mEFs or bone
marrow-derived macrophages lacking ADAM17, suggesting that iRhom2 is stabilized
by ADAM17. By contrast, the levels of iRhom1 were slightly increased in the
absence of ADAM17 in mEFs, indicating that its stability does not depend on
ADAM17. These findings support a model in which iRhom2 and ADAM17 are obligate
binding partners and indicate that iRhom2 stability requires the presence of
ADAM17, whereas iRhom1 is stable in the absence of ADAM17.
