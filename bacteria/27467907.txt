RATIONALE: Patients admitted to intensive care units with sepsis are prone to
developing cardiac dysrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of atrial
fibrillation in a cohort of critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We assessed the association between atrial fibrillation and mortality
using time-dependent competing risks survival analysis. Subsequently, for
development of a risk score estimating the probability of a first occurrence of
atrial fibrillation within the following 24 hours, we performed logistic
regression analysis.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,782 patients with sepsis admitted to two
tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands between January 2011 and June
2013, a total of 1,087 episodes of atrial fibrillation occurred in 418 (23%)
individuals. The cumulative risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation was 10% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 8-12), 22% (95% CI, 18-25), and 40% (95% CI, 36-44) in 
patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, respectively. New-onset
atrial fibrillation was associated with a longer stay (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55;
95% CI, 0.48-0.64), an increased death rate (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), and an
overall increased mortality risk (subdistribution HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.61-2.73)
when considering discharge as a competing event. A simple risk score for daily
prediction of atrial fibrillation occurrence yielded good discrimination (C
statistic, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.84) and calibration (chi-square, 9.38; P = 0.31),
with similar performance in an independent validation cohort (C statistic, 0.80; 
95% CI, 0.76-0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of sepsis and
independently associated with excess mortality. A simple risk score may identify 
patients at high risk of this complication. Clinical trial registered with
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01905033).
