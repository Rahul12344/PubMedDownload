Psychrophilic bacteria, living at low and mild temperatures, can contribute
significantly to our understanding of microbial responses to temperature,
markedly occurring in the bacterial membrane. Here, a newly isolated strain,
Pseudomonas sp. B14-6, was found to dynamically change its unsaturated fatty acid
and cyclic fatty acid content depending on temperature which was revealed by
phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Genome sequencing yielded the sequences 
of the genes Δ-9-fatty acid desaturase (desA) and cyclopropane-fatty
acid-acyl-phospholipid synthase (cfa). Overexpression of desA in Escherichia coli
led to an increase in the levels of unsaturated fatty acids, resulting in
decreased membrane hydrophobicity and increased fluidity. Cfa proteins from
different species were all found to promote bacterial growth, despite their
sequence diversity. In conclusion, PLFA analysis and genome sequencing unraveled 
the temperature-related behavior of Pseudomonas sp. B14-6 and the functions of
two membrane-related enzymes. Our results shed new light on temperature-dependent
microbial behaviors and might allow to predict the consequences of global warming
on microbial communities.
