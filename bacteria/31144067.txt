Mycotoxins are a significant food safety concern. Aflatoxins, trichothecenes,
fumonisins, and ochratoxin A are considered the most important mycotoxins due to 
their frequent occurrence in food products and their well-known toxicity. The
regulation of mycotoxin biosynthesis occurs mainly at transcriptional level, and 
specific regulators have been described in every biosynthetic cluster. Secondary 
metabolite production, including mycotoxin synthesis, is also regulated by
general regulator pathways affected by light, osmotic stress and oxidative
stress, among others. This review is focused on this genetic regulation of
mycotoxin biosynthesis by specific genes and global regulators.
