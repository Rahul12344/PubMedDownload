XRCC4 and XLF are structurally related proteins important for DNA Ligase IV
function. XRCC4 forms a tight complex with DNA Ligase IV while XLF interacts
directly with XRCC4. Both XRCC4 and XLF form homodimers that can polymerize as
heterotypic filaments independently of DNA Ligase IV. Emerging structural and in 
vitro biochemical data suggest that XRCC4 and XLF together generate a filamentous
structure that promotes bridging between DNA molecules. Here, we show that
ablating XRCC4's affinity for XLF results in DNA repair deficits including a
surprising deficit in VDJ coding, but not signal end joining. These data are
consistent with a model whereby XRCC4/XLF complexes hold DNA ends
together--stringently required for coding end joining, but dispensable for signal
end joining. Finally, DNA-PK phosphorylation of XRCC4/XLF complexes disrupt DNA
bridging in vitro, suggesting a regulatory role for DNA-PK's phosphorylation of
XRCC4/XLF complexes.
