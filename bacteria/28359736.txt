BACKGROUND: First Nations in the Canadian province of Manitoba have
disproportionately high rates of epidemic and endemic TB. Gene polymorphisms that
modulate HLA Class I and II antigens are among the risk markers for TB, along
with other biologic, and social determinants of health. HLA-A, B, DRB1, DQA1,
DQB1 were typed in two Manitoba First Nation indigenous groups to identify and
compare the frequency of gene polymorphisms that may influence susceptibility or 
resistance to TB.
METHODS: Participants who self-identified as either Dene or Cree enrolled into
the study from two First Nation communities in Manitoba, Canada. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from blood samples collected with informed consent from Dene (N=63) and
Cree (N=42) First Nation study participants. Participants self-reported having
treated active TB, treated latent TB or no TB. HLA Class I and II molecules were 
typed using sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes from commercially
available kits.
RESULTS: The rates of treated active and latent TB were marginally higher among
the Dene than the Cree participants (p=0.112). Class I and II HLA loci were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the Dene and Cree groups. In this exploratory 
analysis of TB and HLA allele frequencies in Dene and Cree cohorts HLA-A*03 and
HLA-DQB1*05:03 were significantly associated with TB.
CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of TB in both Dene and Cree populations in Canada
requires both biomedical and socioeconomic prevention and control measures. Among
the former, an understanding of HLA diversity among First Nations groups may aid 
the development of new effective vaccine and therapeutic modalities that depend
on the interaction between small molecules and specific HLA epitopes.
