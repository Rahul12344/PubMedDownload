To gain an insight into the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex
alleles, three DRB and one DRA genes were isolated from chimpanzee cDNA
libraries. The nucleotide sequences of the chimpanzee DRB (ChLA-DRB) genes were
then compared with those of the available HLA-DRB alleles by constructing
unrooted phylogenetic trees. All three ChLA-DRB genes were found to be more
closely related to certain HLA-DRB alleles than unrelated HLA-DRB alleles are to 
each other. Since available evidence does not support the convergent evolution of
MHC alleles, this result is consistent with the idea that closely related
ChLA-DRB and HLA-DRB alleles are derived from common ancestral alleles, the
existence of which predates the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineages. The 
predicted amino acid sequences of mature ChLA-DRA and HLA-DRA molecules differ by
only one amino acid.
