Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is highly malignant and frequently expresses
the PML-RARalpha (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha) fusion
protein. This fusion protein is targeted by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and
arsenic trioxide (As2O3), presently used in APL therapy. We have evaluated
effects of ATRA and As2O3 treatment in PML-RARalpha-negative HL60 promyelocytic
leukemia cells, harboring amplified c-myc. Characterization of expression and
activity of c-Myc and its target genes hTERT (human telomerase reverse
transcriptase) and CAD (carbamoyltransferase-dihydroorotase) revealed marked
down-regulation in response to ATRA, but not As2O3. We suggest that blockage of
terminal differentiation upon As2O3 treatment may be mediated through c-Myc.
