Neutrophils are the most abundant effector cells of the innate immune system and 
represent the first line of defense against infection. However, in many common
pathologies, including autoimmune diseases, excessive recruitment and activation 
of neutrophils can drive a chronic inflammatory response leading to unwanted
tissue destruction. Several strategies have been investigated to tackle
pathologic neutrophil biology, and thus provide a novel therapy for chronic
inflammatory diseases. The chemokine receptor CXCR2 plays a crucial role in
regulating neutrophil homeostasis and is a promising pharmaceutical target. In
this study, we report the discovery and validation of a humanized anti-human
CXCR2 monoclonal antibody. To enable in vivo studies, we developed a surrogate
anti-mouse CXCR2 antibody, as well as a human knock-in CXCR2 mouse. When
administered in models of atopic dermatitis (AD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
the antibodies rapidly clear inflammation. Our findings support further
developments of anti-CXCR2 mAb approaches not only for RA and AD, but also for
other neutrophil-mediated inflammatory conditions where neutrophils are
pathogenic and medical needs are unmet.
