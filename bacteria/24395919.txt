Neutrophils are critically involved in host defense and tissue damage. Intrinsic 
signal mechanisms controlling neutrophil activities are poorly defined. We found 
that the expression of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) in mouse and
human neutrophils was downregulated quickly after neutrophil activation through
JNK-microRNA-16 pathway. Importantly, the Wip1 expression level was negatively
correlated with inflammatory cytokine productions of neutrophils in sepsis
patients. Wip1-deficient mice displayed increased bactericidal activities to
Staphylococcus aureus and were hypersensitive to LPS-induced acute lung damage
with increased neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. Mechanism studies showed
that the enhanced inflammatory activity of neutrophils caused by Wip1 deficiency 
was mediated by p38 MAPK-STAT1 and NF-κB pathways. The increased migration
ability of Wip1KO neutrophils was mediated by the decreased CXCR2 internalization
and desensitization, which was directly regulated by p38 MAPK activity. Thus, our
findings identify a previously unrecognized function of Wip1 as an intrinsic
negative regulator for neutrophil proinflammatory cytokine production and
migration through multiple signal pathways.
