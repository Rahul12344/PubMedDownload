PURPOSE: In prostate cancer cells, there is CD24-dependent inactivation of mutant
p53, but the mechanism and its significance remain largely unknown. Here, we
validated this observation and explored the therapeutic potential of targeting
CD24 in TP53 mutant prostate cancer cells.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Overall, 553 prostate cancers (522 formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded and 31 frozen tissues) were assessed for protein or mRNA
expression of CD24 and TP53 The effects of CD24 on p53-dependent transcriptional 
regulation, cancer cell growth, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and mutant p53
restoration were also determined.
RESULTS: As determined with three sample cohorts, CD24 and p53 were not expressed
in prostate epithelial cells but in prostate cancer cells in 48% of cases for
CD24 and 16% of cases for p53 (mutant form). Expressions of CD24 and mutant p53
were more frequently observed in late-stage and metastatic prostate tumors.
Mutant p53 accompanied with CD24 was expressed in most cases (91.6%, 76/83).
Silencing of CD24 increased the transcriptional activity of p53 target genes,
such as CDKNA1, VDR, and TP53INP1, leading to suppression of p53-dependent cell
growth, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in most TP53-mutant prostate cancer
cells. Silencing of CD24 enhanced restoration of PRIMA-1-induced mutant p53 in
endogenous TP53(P223L/V274F) DU145 cells and in PC3 cells transfected with
TP53(R273H) CONCLUSIONS: In human prostate cancers, there is CD24-dependent
inactivation of mutant p53. The coexpression of CD24 and p53 may help identify
aggressive cancers. Targeting CD24 provides a strategy to enhance mutant
p53-restoring therapies, especially in patients with TP53(R273H) prostate cancer.
