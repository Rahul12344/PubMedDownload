Salmonella develops into resident bacteria in epithelial cells, and the
autophagic machinery (Atg) is thought to play an important role in this process. 
In this paper, we show that an autophagosome-like double-membrane structure
surrounds the Salmonella still residing within the Salmonella-containing vacuole 
(SCV). This double membrane is defective in Atg9L1- and FAK family-interacting
protein of 200 kDa (FIP200)-deficient cells. Atg9L1 and FIP200 are important for 
autophagy-specific recruitment of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
complex. However, in the absence of Atg9L1, FIP200, and the PI3K complex, LC3 and
its E3-like enzyme, the Atg16L complex, are still recruited to Salmonella. We
propose that the LC3 system is recruited through a mechanism that is independent 
of isolation membrane generation.
