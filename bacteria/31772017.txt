Venom systems are key adaptations that have evolved throughout the tree of life
and typically facilitate predation or defense. Despite venoms being model systems
for studying a variety of evolutionary and physiological processes, many
taxonomic groups remain understudied, including venomous mammals. Within the
order Eulipotyphla, multiple shrew species and solenodons have oral venom
systems. Despite morphological variation of their delivery systems, it remains
unclear whether venom represents the ancestral state in this group or is the
result of multiple independent origins. We investigated the origin and evolution 
of venom in eulipotyphlans by characterizing the venom system of the endangered
Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus). We constructed a genome to underpin 
proteomic identifications of solenodon venom toxins, before undertaking
evolutionary analyses of those constituents, and functional assessments of the
secreted venom. Our findings show that solenodon venom consists of multiple
paralogous kallikrein 1 (KLK1) serine proteases, which cause hypotensive effects 
in vivo, and seem likely to have evolved to facilitate vertebrate prey capture.
Comparative analyses provide convincing evidence that the oral venom systems of
solenodons and shrews have evolved convergently, with the 4 independent origins
of venom in eulipotyphlans outnumbering all other venom origins in mammals. We
find that KLK1s have been independently coopted into the venom of shrews and
solenodons following their divergence during the late Cretaceous, suggesting that
evolutionary constraints may be acting on these genes. Consequently, our findings
represent a striking example of convergent molecular evolution and demonstrate
that distinct structural backgrounds can yield equivalent functions.
