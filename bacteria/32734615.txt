OBJECTIVES: To describe infection in companion animals with the zoonotic pathogen
Corynebacterium ulcerans and to determine its prevalence in clinically-affected
and healthy animals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical presentation and treatment of three cases of 
C. ulcerans infection is described. Two studies to determine C. ulcerans
prevalence rates were undertaken: (a) a prospective study of nasal samples from
healthy animals, 479 dogs and 72 cats; (b) a retrospective analysis of records of
nasal samples collected over a 10-year period from 189 dogs and 64 cats affected 
by respiratory signs.
RESULTS: Toxigenic C. ulcerans was isolated from four cats with nasal discharge
while concurrent C. ulcerans and mecC methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection
was detected in a dog suffering from chronic nasal discharge. Clinical features
were not distinctive and all cases recovered following antimicrobial treatment.
Multilocus sequence typing supported a common source for isolates from the
shelter cats. Carriage rates of C. ulcerans in healthy animals were 0.42% (2/479)
in dogs and 0.00% (0/72) in cats whereas in animals with signs of upper
respiratory tract infection prevalence rates were 0.53% (1/189) in dogs and 6.25%
(4/64) in cats.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicians should be aware that dogs and cats can be
infected with (or carriers of) toxigenic C. ulcerans Considering the potential
zoonotic risk, assistance from medical and public health colleagues should be
sought in confirmed cases.
