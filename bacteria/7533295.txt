We describe a simple reproducible system for enrichment and long-term culture of 
human B-cell progenitors. Enriched CD34+ cord blood mononuclear cells are seeded 
onto a murine stromal cell line to establish a biphasic culture system. These
cultures are characterized by transient growth of myeloid cells followed by
outgrowth of cells highly enriched for early B-cell progenitors. Cultures
consisting of > 90% early B-lineage cells [expressing CD10, CD19, CD38, and CD45 
but lacking CD20, CD22, CD23, and surface IgM] are maintained for > 12 weeks
without growth factor addition. Cells remain predominantly germ line at the
immunoglobulin locus and express only low levels of cytoplasmic mu chain,
terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and recombination-activating gene 1
product. They are unresponsive to the pre-B-cell growth factors interleukin 7 or 
stem cell factor, or both, suggesting that growth support is provided by a
cross-reactive murine stromal cell factor. Cultured B-cell progenitors are
generated in large numbers ( > 10(8) cells from a typical cord blood specimen)
suitable for use in biochemical analysis and gene-transfer studies. This system
should be useful for study of normal and abnormal early human B-lymphopoiesis.
