Activation of the complement cascade plays an important role in the pathogenesis 
of postinfectious glomerulonephritis. We report successful terminal complement
pathway blockade using an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody (eculizumab) in an
8-year-old child with severe acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis requiring
hemodialysis. The child presented with clinical, serologic, and histopathologic
criteria for diffuse crescentic postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Complement
measurements showed low C3 and C4 levels, with increased SC5b-9 titers. The
presence of a transient anti-factor H autoantibody was also identified.
Eculizumab (600mg, 2 doses at a 1-week interval) was administered, with a
striking recovery of kidney function. There were no additional hemodialysis
sessions needed after the first dose of eculizumab, and glomerular filtration
rate measured using inulin clearance at 12 months of follow-up was within the
normal range (92mL/min/1.73m2). Prompt terminal complement blockade may have
improved the outcome in this case of severe acute postinfectious
glomerulonephritis.
