As its name implies, the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) requires DNA
double-stranded ends for enzymatic activation. Here, I demonstrate that
hairpinned DNA ends are ineffective for activating the kinase toward many of its 
well-studied substrates (p53, XRCC4, XLF, HSP90). However, hairpinned DNA ends
robustly stimulate certain DNA-PK autophosphorylations. Specifically,
autophosphorylation sites within the ABCDE cluster are robustly phosphorylated
when DNA-PK is activated by hairpinned DNA ends. Of note, phosphorylation of the 
ABCDE sites is requisite for activation of the Artemis nuclease that associates
with DNA-PK to mediate hairpin opening. This finding suggests a multi-step
mechanism of kinase activation. Finally, I find that all non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) defective cells (whether deficient in components of the DNA-PK
complex or components of the ligase complex) are similarly deficient in joining
DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with hairpinned termini.
