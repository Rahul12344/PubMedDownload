INTRODUCTION: NKT cells comprise a rare, but important subset of T cells which
account for ~0.2% of the total circulating T cell population. NKT cells are known
to have anti-tumor functions and rapidly produce high levels of cytokines
following activation. Several clinical trials have sought to exploit the effector
functions of NKT cells. While some studies have shown promise, NKT cells are
approximately 50% lower in cancer patients compared to healthy donors of the same
age and gender, thus limiting their therapeutic efficacy. These studies indicate 
that baseline levels of activation should be assessed before initiating an NKT
cell based immunotherapeutic strategy.
AIM: The goal of this study was to develop a sensitive method to rapidly assess
NKT cell function.
METHODS: We utilized artificial antigen presenting cells in combination with qPCR
in order to determine NKT cell function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from healthy donors and breast cancer patients.
RESULTS: We found that NKT cell activation can be detected by qPCR, but not by
ELISA, in healthy donors as well as in breast cancer patients following four hour
stimulation.
CONCLUSION: This method utilizing CD1d-expressing aAPCs will enhance our
knowledge of NKT cell biology and could potentially be used as a novel tool in
adoptive immunotherapeutic strategies.
