We conducted a study to investigate the role of three common SNPs in the IL-17A
and IL-17F genes (rs2275913G>A, rs3748067C>T and rs763780T>C) in the development 
of gastric cancer, and their interaction with H.pylori infection. A total of 326 
patients with gastric cancer and 326 control subjects were consecutively
recruited between May 2012 and May 2014. Genotyping of IL-17A rs2275913G>A and
rs3748067C>T and IL-17F rs763780T>C was performed in a 384-well plate format on
the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. By logistic regression analysis, individuals
carrying the GA and AA genotypes of IL-17 rs2275913G>A were significantly
associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer when compared with GG
genotype, and the adjusted Ors (95% CI) were 1.46 (1.03-2.06) for GA genotype and
2.57 (1.51-4.43) for AA genotype. We observed that the GA+AA genotype of
rs2275913 was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer among H.pylori 
infection subjects (OR=2.21, 95% CI=1.29-3.79). In conclusion, we found that
there was a significant association between L-17A rs2275913G>A polymorphism and
increased gastric cancer risk, especially in H.pylori infection subjects.
