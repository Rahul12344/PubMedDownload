We raised an antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids
155-174 of human retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha). The sequence is highly
homologous in all RARs and their isoforms. When mouse and human RARs (alpha, beta
and gamma) expressed in Cos cell were analysed with immunoblot, all receptors
gave a specific 51 K signal. Mouse RAR-gamma gave an additional signal
corresponding to 58 K. In human teratocarcinoma cells (F9) both 51 and 58K
molecule sizes were detected. The RAR expression in F9 cells was slightly
down-regulated in charcoal-stripped culture medium and returned to normal level
after retinoic acid treatment. The 51 K protein was found in all ovarian and
uterine samples, but the quantity of the 58 K protein varied in different species
and organs, being highest in the mouse uterus and the rat and human ovary. Using 
immunohistochemistry the RARs were found in the nuclear compartment. In the rat
uterus, positive immunoreaction was found mainly in the nuclei of epithelial,
uterine glandular and stromal cells. In the rat ovary, positive reaction was
found in the nuclei of germinal epithelial, follicular and stromal cells.
