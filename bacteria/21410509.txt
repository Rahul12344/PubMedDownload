Methanococcus maripaludis has two surface appendages, namely flagella and pili.
Flagella have been shown to be required for swimming, but no specific role has
been assigned as yet to pili. In this report, wild-type M. maripaludis cells are 
compared with mutants lacking either pili or flagella or both surface appendages 
in their ability to attach to a variety of surfaces including nickel, gold and
molybdenum grids as well as glass, silicon and mica. Wild-type cells attached to 
varying degrees to all surfaces tested, except mica, via their flagella as
observed by scanning electron microscopy. Large cables of flagella were found to 
leave the cell and to be unwound on the surface. In addition, such cables were
often found to connect cells. In contrast, cells lacking either flagella or pili 
or both surface appendages were unable to attach efficiently to any surfaces.
This indicates a second role for flagella in addition to swimming in M.
maripaludis, as well as a first role for pili in this organism, namely in surface
attachment.
