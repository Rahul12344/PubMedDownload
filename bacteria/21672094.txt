AIMS: To study the antimicrobial activity of naringin (NAR), a flavonoid
extracted from citrus industry waste, and NAR derivatives [naringenin (NGE),
prunin and alkyl prunin esters] against pathogenic bacteria such as L.
monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus. The relationship between the
structure of the chemical compounds and their antagonistic effect was also
analysed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The agar dilution technique and direct contact assaying were
applied. NGE, prunin and NAR showed no antimicrobial activity at a concentration 
of 0.25 mmol l(-1). Similarly, fatty acids with a chain length between C2 and C18
showed no antimicrobial activity at the same concentration. However,
prunin-6″-O-acyl esters presented high antibacterial activity, mainly against
Gram-positive strains. This activity increased with increasing chain length (up
to 10-12 carbon atoms). Alkyl prunin esters with 10-12 carbon atoms diminished
viability of L. monocytogenes by about 3 log orders and S. aureus by 6 log orders
after 2 h of contact at 37°C and at a concentration of 0.25 mmol l(-1). The
compounds examined were not effective against any of the Gram-negative strains
assayed, even at the highest concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of sugars to the aglycone did not enhance its antimicrobial
activity. Attachment of a saturated aliphatic chain with 10-12 carbon atoms to
the A ring of the flavonoid (or to sugars attached to this ring), seems to be the
most promising modification. In conclusion, alkyl prunin esters with a chain
length of C10-C12 have promising features as antimicrobial agents because of
their high antilisterial and antistaphylococcal activity.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that it is possible to
obtain NAR derivatives with important antimicrobial activity, especially against 
Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. It also provides guidelines on the structural 
modifications in similar molecules to enhance the antimicrobial activity.
