Pathogens invade intestinal mucosal barrier through phagocytosis of antigen
presenting cells (dendritic cell, microfold cells), or through the invasion into 
the intestinal epithelial directly. Some pathogens could damage the cell junction
between epithelial cells and use the paracellular pathway as an entrance to
invade. Moreover, some Lactobacillus could inhibit the adhesion of the pathogens 
and protect the integrity of the cell junction and mucosal barrier. This research
focused on the potential therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus fructosus (L.
fructosus) C2 to attenuate ETEC K88 or S. typhimurium SL1344 induced changes to
mucosal barrier. The results demonstrated that treatment of polarized Caco-2
cells with L. fructosus C2 reduced the permeation of dextran, and expression of
IL-8, p-ERK, and p-JNK when cells were infected with pathogenic bacteria. The
findings indicated that L. fructosus C2 exerted a protective effect against the
damage to the integrity of Caco-2 cells by ETEC or S. typhimurium infection.
