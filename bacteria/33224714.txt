Physicians think of mast cells and IgE primarily in the context of allergic
disorders, including fatal anaphylaxis. This 'bad side' of mast cells and IgE is 
so well accepted that it can be difficult to think of them in other contexts,
particularly those in which they may have beneficial functions. However, there is
evidence that mast cells and IgE, as well as basophils (circulating granulocytes 
whose functions partially overlap with those of mast cells), can contribute to
host defense as components of adaptive type 2 immune responses to helminths,
ticks and certain other parasites. Accordingly, allergies often are
conceptualized as "misdirected" type 2 immune responses, in which IgE antibodies 
are produced against any of a diverse group of apparently harmless antigens, and 
against components of animal venoms. Indeed, certain unfortunate patients who
have become sensitized to venoms develop severe IgE-associated allergic
reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis, upon subsequent venom exposure. In this
review, we will describe evidence that mast cells can enhance innate resistance, 
and survival, to challenge with reptile or arthropod venoms during a first
exposure to such venoms. We also will discuss findings indicating that, in mice
surviving an initial encounter with venom, acquired type 2 immune responses, IgE 
antibodies, the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), and mast cells can contribute
to acquired resistance to the lethal effects of both honeybee venom and Russell's
viper venom. These findings support the hypothesis that mast cells and IgE can
help protect the host against venoms and perhaps other noxious substances.
