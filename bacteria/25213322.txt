The serine/cysteine protease inhibitor SCCA1 (SERPINB3) is upregulated in many
advanced cancers with poor prognosis, but there is limited information about
whether it makes functional contributions to malignancy. Here, we show that SCCA1
expression promoted oncogenic transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells, and that SCCA1 silencing in breast 
cancer cells halted their proliferation. SCCA1 overexpression in neu(+) mammary
tumors increased the unfolded protein response (UPR), IL6 expression, and
inflammatory phenotypes. Mechanistically, SCCA1 induced a prolonged nonlethal
increase in the UPR that was sufficient to activate NF-κB and expression of the
protumorigenic cytokine IL6. Overall, our findings established that SCCA1
contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting EMT and a UPR-dependent induction of
NF-κB and IL6 autocrine signaling that promotes a protumorigenic inflammation.
