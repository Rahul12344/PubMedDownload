CTL clones were derived from HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice by immunization with a
human cell expressing HLA-A2.1. None of these clones lysed murine transfectants, 
and only 3 of 23 lysed monkey transfectants expressing HLA-A2. In contrast, all
of these clones lysed a wide variety of human cells expressing HLA-A2.1. These
results demonstrate the existence of species-specific epitopes on the HLA-A2.1
molecule, and suggest that these epitopes are formed by the association of class 
I MHC products with one or more endogenous species-specific molecules. These
results provide an explanation for the frequently observed failure of HLA class
I-specific CTL to recognize these antigens on murine transfectants. These results
also suggest that such endogenous proteins may also contribute to the formation
of epitopes recognized by allospecific CTL.
