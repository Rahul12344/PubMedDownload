This work presents an analysis of a stirred anaerobic sequencing discontinuous
reactor with different substrate feeding strategies resulting in batch,
fed-batch/batch and fed-batch operating modes. The reactor, containing granulated
biomass, was fed with approximately 2.0L of synthetic domestic wastewater with
Chemical Oxygen Demand of nearly 500 mg/L per cycle and operated at 30 degrees C 
and 50 rpm. Three feeding strategies with a total cycle time of 6 h, including
30-min settling, were adopted: batch mode with a fill cycle of 6 min, a
fed-batch/batch mode with fill cycles of 60, 120 and 240 min and fed-batch mode
with a fill cycle of 320 min. The system attained average non-filtered and
filtered substrate removal efficiency of 78 and 84%, respectively, for all
operating conditions, presenting good stability, solid retention and no granule
break-up. A first order kinetic model with a residual organic matter
concentration was proposed to analyze the influence of the feeding strategy on
the performance during a cycle and bicarbonate alkalinity and total volatile
acids concentration profiles were also quantified in order to verify the
transient stability behavior.
