Enzymes with radical-pair intermediates have been considered as a likely target
for purported magnetic field effects in humans. The bacterial enzyme ethanolamine
ammonia lyase and the human enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyze coenzyme
B12-dependent rearrangement reactions. A common step in the mechanism of these
two enzymes is postulated to be homolysis of the cobalt-carbon bond of the
cofactor to generate a spin-correlated radical pair consisting of the
5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and cob(II)alamin [Ado. Cbl(II)]. Thus, the reactions
catalyzed by these enzymes are expected to be sensitive to an applied magnetic
field according to the same principles that control radical pair chemical
reactions. The magnetic field effect on ethanolamine ammonia lyase reported
previously has been corroborated independently in one of the authors' laboratory.
However, neither the human nor the bacterial mutase from Propionibacterium
shermanii exhibits a magnetic field effect that could be greater than about 15%, 
considering the error limit imposed by the uncertainty of the coupled assay. Our 
studies suggest that putative magnetic field effects on physiological processes
are not likely to be mediated by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.
