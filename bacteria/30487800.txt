CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate-like T cells
that express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) Î±-chain and recognize self and
foreign glycolipid antigens. They can rapidly respond to agonist activation and
stimulate an extensive array of immune responses. Thymic development and function
of iNKT cells are regulated by many different cellular processes, including
autophagy, a self-degradation mechanism. In this mini review, we discuss the
current understanding of how autophagy regulates iNKT cell development and
effector lineage differentiation. Importantly, we propose that iNKT cell
development is tightly controlled by metabolic reprogramming.
