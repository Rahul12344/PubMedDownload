The cytotoxicity of Shiga toxin (Stx) 1 and Stx2 produced by Escherichia coli to 
human renal cortical epithelial cells (HRCEC) in primary culture was
investigated. HRCEC express CD24, the marker of renal distal tubules, as well as 
globotriaosyl ceramide/CD77, the receptor for Stxs. Binding of Stxs to HRCEC was 
confirmed by positive staining with specific antibodies to Stxs. Treatment of
HRCEC with Stxs induced rapid cell death, which was reversed in the presence of
neutralizing antibody specific for Stx. DNA fragmentation was found to be
accompanied by Stx-mediated cell death in HRCEC, indicating that apoptosis was
part of the process. These data and previous reports indicate that a variety of
renal cell types, including tubular epithelial cells as well as glomerular
capillary endothelial cells, may be targets for Stx-mediated apoptosis, which
could contribute to the pathogenesis of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by
Stx-producing E. coli infection.
