Exposure to heavy metals can cause several diseases associated with the immune
system. Although the effects of heavy metals on production of inflammatory
cytokines have been previously studied, the role of heavy metals in inflammasome 
activation remains poorly studied. The inflammasome is an intracellular
multi-protein complex that detects intracellular danger signals, resulting in
inflammatory responses such as cytokine maturation and pyroptosis. In this study,
we elucidated the effects of four heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd), mercury
(Hg), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb), on the activation of NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2
inflammasomes. In our results, mercury and arsenic inhibited interleukin (IL)-1β 
and IL-18 secretion resulting from canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in macrophages and attenuated elevation of serum IL-1β in response to 
LPS treatment in mice. In the mechanical studies, mercury interrupted production 
of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, release of mitochondrial DNA, and
activity of recombinant caspase-1, whereas arsenic down-regulated expression of
promyelocytic leukemia protein. Both mercury and arsenic inhibited Asc
pyroptosome formation and gasdermin D cleavage. Thus, we suggest that exposure to
mercury and/or arsenic could disrupt inflammasome-mediated inflammatory
responses, which might cause unexpected side effects.
