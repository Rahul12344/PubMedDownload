PURPOSE: The educational environment (EE) plays a very important role in
effective student learning. The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure
(DREEM) is a validated tool to assess the EE. This study aimed to collect
baseline information about our medical student's perception of the EE, and to
identify areas of strengths and weaknesses as well as scope for improvements in
the current EE.
METHODS: Medical students and interns were included in this cross-sectional
study. The DREEM questionnaire was used to measure students' perceptions about
the EE, which has five domains: students' perceptions of learning; students'
perceptions of teachers; students' academic self-perceptions; students'
perceptions of atmosphere; and students' social self-perceptions. Students were
asked to respond using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Data was analyzed using
suitable tests and statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS: The mean global DREEM score was 123/200. All students had more positive 
than negative academic self-perception (21.24/32), perception of atmosphere
(29.21/48), and perception of learning (28.99/48), while their social
self-perception (17.48/28) was not too bad and perception of teachers (26.71/44) 
moved in the right direction. The fifth semester students perceived EE more
positively than other semester students.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that all students perceived their EE
positively. The positive points were that teachers were knowledgeable, that
students had good friends, and they were confident about passing their exams.
Problem areas observed were authoritarian teachers, overemphasis on factual
learning, overly teacher-centered teaching, teachers getting angry, and the need 
for a support system for stressed students.
