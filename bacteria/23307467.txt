Cranial aspergillosis may present as meningitis, cerebral abscess, cerebral
infarcts/haemorrhages or extra-axial mass. Extra-axial cranial aspergilloma may
mimic meningioma owing to mass-like characteristics and intense contrast
enhancement on MRI there by delaying the diagnosis and further worsening the
already bad prognosis in these patients. We present a 45-year-old gentleman who
presented with signs of raised intracranial hypertension, secondary optic atrophy
and a contrast-enhancing mass arising from the planum sphenoidale.
Postoperatively, mass was diagnosed as aspergilloma on histopathology and
culture. Despite antifungal treatment, patient could not be saved due to large
artery infarcts in the immediate postoperative period. We discuss the clinical
and MRI features that could help to have sufficient and early suspicion of fungal
aetiology in these patients.
