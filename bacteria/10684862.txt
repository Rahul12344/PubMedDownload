Maturational changes at the CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative (DN) to CD4(+)CD8(+)
double positive (DP) transition are dependent on signals generated via the pre-T 
cell receptor (TCR) and the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase p56(lck) (Lck).
How Lck activities are stimulated or relayed after pre-TCR formation remains
obscure. Our structure-function mapping of Lck thymopoietic properties reveals
that the noncatalytic domains of Lck are specialized to signal efficient cellular
expansion at DN to DP transition. Moreover, although substitution of the Lck
catalytic domain with FynT sequences minimally impacts DP development, single
positive thymocytes are most efficiently produced in the presence of kinases
containing both the NH(2)-terminal and catalytic regions of Lck. These findings
demonstrate that the Lck structure is uniquely adapted to mediate signals at both
major transitions in thymopoiesis.
