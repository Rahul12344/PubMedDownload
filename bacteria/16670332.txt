The human endometrium (EM) contains macrophages, NK cells, T cells, B cells, and 
neutrophils in contact with a variety of stromal and epithelial cells. The
interplay between these different cell types and their roles in defense against
pathogen invasion in this specialized tissue are important for controlling
infection and reproduction. TLRs are a family of receptors able to recognize
conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In this study, we determined
the expression of TLRs on uterine NK (uNK) cells from the human EM and the extent
to which uNK cells responded to TLR agonist stimulation. uNK cells expressed TLRs
2, 3, and 4, and produced IFN-gamma when total human endometrial cells were
stimulated with agonists to TLR2 or TLR3 (peptidoglycan or poly(I:C),
respectively). Activated uNK cell clones produced IFN-gamma upon stimulation with
peptidoglycan or poly(I:C). However, purified uNK cells did not respond directly 
to TLR agonists, but IFN-gamma was produced by uNK cells in response to TLR
stimulation when cocultured with APCs. These data indicate that uNK cells express
TLRs and that they can respond to TLR agonists within EM by producing IFN-gamma. 
These data also indicate that the uNK cells do not respond directly to TLR
stimulation, but rather their production of IFN-gamma is dependent upon
interactions with other cells within EM.
