A beta-lactamase produced by a penicillin-resistant strain of Serratia marcescens
was isolated and purified. The kcat. value for benzylpenicillin was about 5% of
that observed for the best cephalosporin substrates. However, the low Km of the
penam resulted in a high catalytic efficiency (kcat./Km) and the classification
of the enzyme as a cephalosporinase might not be completely justified. It also
exhibited a low but measurable activity against cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cefoxitin
and moxalactam. Substrate-induced inactivation was observed both with a very good
(cephalothin) or a very bad (moxalactam) substrate. The active site was labelled 
by beta-iodopenicillanate. Trypsin digestion produced a 19-residue active-site
peptide whose sequence clearly allowed the classification of the enzyme as a
class C beta-lactamase.
