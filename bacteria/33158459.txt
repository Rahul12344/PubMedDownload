BACKGROUND: After traumatic skeletal muscle injury, muscle healing is often
incomplete and produces extensive fibrosis. The sequence of M1 and M2 macrophage 
accumulation and the duration of each subtype in the injured area may help to
direct the relative extent of fibrogenesis and myogenesis during healing. We
hypothesized that increasing the number of M1 macrophages early after traumatic
muscle injury would produce more cellular and molecular substrates for myogenesis
and fewer substrates for fibrosis, leading to better muscle healing.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we transfected skeletal muscle with a plasmid
vector to transiently express GM-CSF shortly after injury to drive the
polarization of macrophages towards the M1 subset. C57BL/6 mouse tibialis
anterior (TA) muscles were injured by contusion and electroporated with uP-mGM,
which is a plasmid vector that transiently expresses GM-CSF. Myogenesis,
angiogenesis, and fibrosis were evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, and
RT-qPCR; subpopulations of macrophages by flow cytometry; and muscle functioning 
by the maximum running speed on the treadmill and the recovery of muscle mass.
RESULTS: Muscle injury increased the number of local M1-like macrophages and
decreased the number of M2-like macrophages on day 4, and uP-mGM treatment
enhanced this variation. uP-mGM treatment decreased TGF-β1 protein expression on 
day 4, and the Sirius Red-positive area decreased from 35.93 ± 15.45% (no
treatment) to 2.9% ± 6.5% (p < 0.01) on day 30. uP-mGM electroporation also
increased Hgf, Hif1α, and Mtor gene expression; arteriole density; and muscle
fiber number during regeneration. The improvement in the quality of the muscle
tissue after treatment with uP-mGM affected the increase in the TA muscle mass
and the maximum running speed on a treadmill.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data show that increasing the number of M1-like
macrophages immediately after traumatic muscle injury promotes muscle recovery
with less fibrosis, and this can be achieved by the transient expression of
GM-CSF.
