Sugar esters are considered as surfactants due to its amphiphilic balance that
can lower the surface tension in oil/water mixtures. Enzymatic syntheses of these
compounds are interesting both from economic and environmental considerations. A 
study was carried out to evaluate the effect of four solvents, temperature,
substrate molar ratio, biocatalyst source, and immobilization methodology on the 
yield and specific productivity of lactulose palmitate monoester synthesis.
Lipases from Pseudomonas stutzeri (PsL) and Alcaligenes sp. (AsL), immobilized in
porous silica functionalized with octyl groups (adsorption immobilization, OS)
and with glyoxyl-octyl groups (both adsorption and covalent immobilization, OGS),
were used. The highest lactulose palmitate yields were obtained at 47 °C in
acetone, for all biocatalysts, while the best lactulose:palmitic acid molar ratio
differed according to the immobilization methodology, being 1:1 for AsL-OGS
biocatalyst (20.7 ± 3%) and 1:3 for the others (30-50%).
