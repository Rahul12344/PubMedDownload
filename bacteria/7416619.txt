Serologically detectable HLA-A, B, and C loci antigens in farmer's lung disease.

Flaherty DK, Braun SR, Marx JJ, Blank JL, Emanuel DA, Rankin J.

The frequency of serologically detectable (SD) HLA-A, B, and C loci antigens in
subjects with farmer's lung disease (N = 100) was compared with that of age- and 
sex-matched normal normal farmers with no precipitating antibodies to extracts of
thermophilic actinomycetes. A subset of the farming population with antibodies to
the thermophilic actinomycetes and no evidence of clinical disease (N = 55) was
also agae- and sex-matched to the farmer's lung disease population. No
significant associations between any of the SD HLA antigens tested and farmer's
lung disease were found in the study. The data demonstrated that there was no
association between SD HLA antigens and farmer's lung disease in random
populations.
