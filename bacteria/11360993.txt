Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ammonium sulfate
fractionation were employed in series to purify and concentrate a 12.5-kDa
protein fragment with a periodic (24-min period) proteinase K-resistant and
drug-unresponsive NADH oxidase (CNOX) activity from pooled sera from healthy
volunteers. The activity was unresponsive to capsaicin to distinguish it from the
previously isolated cancer-associated NOX form (tNOX). Polyclonal antisera
generated to the CNOX fragment cross-reacted with 20.5- to 24-kDa proteins of
human sera, human lymphocytes, and plasma membranes from Escherichia coli with
the molecular weight depending on source and conditions of treatment with
proteinase K.
