A 2-year-old intact female mixed-breed dog with a 1-month history of lethargy and
anorexia was evaluated for abdominal distension and an abdominal mass. The dog's 
last heat cycle, her third, was 1 month prior to presentation, and no
reproductive cycle abnormalities were noted at any time. Hematologic and serum
biochemical abnormalities were consistent with hemorrhage and inflammation.
Ultrasonographic examination confirmed a large midabdominal mass and a moderate
amount of abdominal fluid. Cytologically, the fluid showed evidence of
pyogranulomatous inflammation, hemorrhage, and mesothelial reactivity, as well as
ciliated columnar cells and free cilia that were interpreted as likely of
oviductal origin. The mass was removed surgically, and the histopathologic
interpretation was oviductal hamartoma with marked stroma formation and acute
hemorrhage. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of
oviductal hamartoma in any species and the first reported case detailing the
finding of ciliated columnar epithelial cells in the abdominal fluid of a dog.
Ciliated columnar epithelial cells in abdominal fluid should be considered
indicative of a likely underlying oviductal lesion.
