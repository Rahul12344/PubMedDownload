Adaptive immunity in homeotherms depends greatly on CD4+ Th cells which release
cytokines in response to specific antigen stimulation. Whilst bony fish and
poikilothermic tetrapods possess cells that express TcR and CD4-related genes
(that exist in two forms in teleost fish; termed CD4-1 and CD4-2), to date there 
is no unequivocal demonstration that cells equivalent to Th exist. Thus, in this 
study we determined whether CD4-1+ lymphocytes can express cytokines typical of
Th cells following antigen specific stimulation, using the zebrafish (Danio
rerio). Initially, we analyzed the CD4 locus in zebrafish and found three CD4
homologues, a CD4-1 molecule and two CD4-2 molecules. The zfCD4-1 and zfCD4-2
transcripts were detected in immune organs and were most highly expressed in
lymphocytes. A polyclonal antibody to zfCD4-1 was developed and used with an
antibody to ZAP70 and revealed double positive cells by immunohistochemistry, and
in the Mycobacterium marinum disease model CD4-1+ cells were apparent surrounding
the granulomas typical of the infection. Next a prime-boost experiment, using
human gamma globulin as antigen, was performed and revealed for the first time in
fish that zfCD4-1+ lymphocytes increase the expression of cytokines and master
transcription factors relevant to Th1/Th2-type responses as a consequence of
boosting with specific antigen.
