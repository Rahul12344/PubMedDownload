Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal cancer with fewer than 7% of
patients surviving past 5 years. T-cell immunity has been linked to the
exceptional outcome of the few long-term survivors, yet the relevant antigens
remain unknown. Here we use genetic, immunohistochemical and transcriptional
immunoprofiling, computational biophysics, and functional assays to identify
T-cell antigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer. Using whole-exome
sequencing and in silico neoantigen prediction, we found that tumours with both
the highest neoantigen number and the most abundant CD8+ T-cell infiltrates, but 
neither alone, stratified patients with the longest survival. Investigating the
specific neoantigen qualities promoting T-cell activation in long-term survivors,
we discovered that these individuals were enriched in neoantigen qualities
defined by a fitness model, and neoantigens in the tumour antigen MUC16 (also
known as CA125). A neoantigen quality fitness model conferring greater
immunogenicity to neoantigens with differential presentation and homology to
infectious disease-derived peptides identified long-term survivors in two
independent datasets, whereas a neoantigen quantity model ascribing greater
immunogenicity to increasing neoantigen number alone did not. We detected
intratumoural and lasting circulating T-cell reactivity to both high-quality and 
MUC16 neoantigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer, including clones
with specificity to both high-quality neoantigens and predicted cross-reactive
microbial epitopes, consistent with neoantigen molecular mimicry. Notably, we
observed selective loss of high-quality and MUC16 neoantigenic clones on
metastatic progression, suggesting neoantigen immunoediting. Our results identify
neoantigens with unique qualities as T-cell targets in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. More broadly, we identify neoantigen quality as a biomarker for
immunogenic tumours that may guide the application of immunotherapies.
