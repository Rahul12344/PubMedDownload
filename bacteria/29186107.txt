Interleukin (IL)-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in mice and humans. It is
recognized as a key factor for the protection of mice against various pathogens, 
but it also underlies pathogenic inflammatory responses in numerous mouse models.
The inborn errors of IL-17A- and IL-17F-mediated immunity identified in humans in
the last decade have revealed that IL-17A and IL-17F are key players in
mucocutaneous immunity to Candida albicans, and, to a lesser extent,
Staphylococcus aureus. By contrast, there is currently no genetic evidence for a 
causal link between excess of IL-17 and autoimmunity, autoinflammation, or
allergy in humans. We discuss here the physiological and pathological roles of
mouse and human IL-17A and IL-17F in host defense and excessive inflammation. We 
highlight recent advances in our understanding of the consequences of deficient
or excessive IL-17 immunity at various mucocutaneous sites, including the oral
cavity, skin, intestine, lungs, and vagina.
