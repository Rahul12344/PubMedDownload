The effect of intestinal molecules produced by the host on the virulence of
Pseudomonas fluorescens is poorly documented. In the present work, we evaluated
the secretion of human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) by enterocytes after infection with
P. fluorescens (a species previously suggested to be involved in inflammatory
bowel disease) and investigated the effect of this host-defense peptide on the
bacterial virulence. The results showed that P. fluorescens can induce hBD-2
production in Caco-2/TC7 cells via P38 and ERK MAPK-dependent pathways.
Surprisingly, the exposure of P. fluorescens to low doses of the antimicrobial
peptide was found to enhance its cytotoxic and proinflammatory effects suggesting
a potential feedback mechanism in the dialog between bacteria and the host.
