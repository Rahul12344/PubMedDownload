Microbes are competent chemists that are able to generate thousands of chemically
complex natural products with potent biological activities. The key to the
formation of this chemical diversity has been the rapid evolution of secondary
metabolism. Many enzymes residing on these metabolic pathways have acquired
atypical catalytic properties in comparison with their counterparts found in
primary metabolism. The biosynthetic pathway of the anthracycline nogalamycin
contains two such proteins, SnoK and SnoN, belonging to nonheme iron and
2-oxoglutarate-dependent mono-oxygenases. In spite of structural similarity, the 
two proteins catalyze distinct chemical reactions; SnoK is a C2-C5″ carbocyclase,
whereas SnoN catalyzes stereoinversion at the adjacent C4″ position. Here, we
have identified four structural regions involved in the functional
differentiation and generated 30 chimeric enzymes to probe catalysis. Our
analyses indicate that the carbocyclase SnoK is the ancestral form of the enzyme 
from which SnoN has evolved to catalyze stereoinversion at the neighboring
carbon. The critical step in the appearance of epimerization activity has likely 
been the insertion of three residues near the C-terminus, which allow
repositioning of the substrate in front of the iron center. The loss of the
original carbocyclization activity has then occurred with changes in four amino
acids near the iron center that prohibit alignment of the substrate for the
formation of the C2-C5″ bond. Our study provides detailed insights into the
evolutionary processes that have enabled Streptomyces soil bacteria to become the
major source of antibiotics and antiproliferative agents. ENZYMES: EC number
