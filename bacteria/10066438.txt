Protein A (PA) of Staphylococcus aureus is known for its immunostimulatory,
anti-cancer, and anti-toxic properties. The present study revealed that PA
stimulates specific immunocytes to act as a potential immunorestorer. It has also
been shown that the percentage of various cell types bearing different clusters
of differentiation markers, e.g., CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+), increases considerably
after inoculation with PA. It has also been observed that CD34(+) progenitor
cells of bone marrow also increased significantly (P < 0.05) upon PA treatment.
PA significantly elevated Th-1 cytokines, e.g., IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and
IL-1alpha. The increased percentages of CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+), CD34(+) cells
and elevated cytokine levels in PA treated animals may contribute to the reported
anti-tumor, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, and anti-toxic properties of PA. Since
in various diseased conditions and during toxic drug therapy lymphocytes bearing 
such differentiation markers get suppressed, this type of approach could help in 
immunorestoration of the host. These findings might help in designing therapeutic
approaches toward various diseases which cause immunosuppression.
