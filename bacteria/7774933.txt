The phospholipase C gamma-2 (Plcg2) gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial
role in intracellular signal transduction pathways. This enzyme is important
because of its role in the generation of second messengers following the
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We have now determined the
chromosomal location of this gene in the mouse and human genomes. An
interspecific backcross involving AEJ/Gn and Mus spretus mice was used to
localize the gene in mouse. A rodent/human somatic cell hybrid panel was used to 
map PLCG2 in the human genome. Our results position Plcg2 in the central region
of mouse chromosome 8. We also show that PLCG2 maps to the long arm of human
chromosome 16, in the region q22-qter. Plcg2 does not map near its most closely
related family member, Plcg1, in either genome, indicating that the mammalian
Plcg genes belong to a dispersed family.
