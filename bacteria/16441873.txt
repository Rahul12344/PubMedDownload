Online hemodiafiltration appears to be the most effective technique of renal
replacement therapy in many respects. Removal of small and high-molecular weight 
substances is enhanced. Modern technology ensures a safe, online production of
reinfusion fluids. Nonetheless, stringent maintenance rules are required for the 
production of sterile and nonpyrogenic-dialysate solutions. In this review, we
will critically review the state of the art of the clinical effects derived from 
the use of ultrapure dialysate and the online production of dialysate fluids in
high-flux hemodiafiltration.
