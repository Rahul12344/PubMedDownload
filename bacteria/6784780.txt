Degradation of DDT and its analogs by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 640x.

The possibility of complete degradation of DDT by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 640x was
demonstrated in principle. A study of the conditions of degradation of DDT by
this culture was made. It was demonstrated that only dechlorination of DDT to DDD
is accomplished without addition of a supplementary substrate. The rest of the
processes right up to the formation of benzhydrol and phenylacetic acid take
place only under conditions of cometabolism. For dechlorination of the aliphatic 
fragment of DDT and the aromatic rings, anaerobic conditions, nitrates in the
form of electron acceptors, and calcium lactate as a cosubstrate are preferred.
Degradation of nonchlorinated benzophenone takes place only under aerobic
conditions with glycerol as a cosubstrate. Phenylacetic acid and benzhydrol are
used by the culture as sole sources of carbon; aerobic conditions are necessary
for their degradation. On the basis of analysis of decomposition products of DDT 
and a study of the pathways of degradation of its metabolites and analogs, a
means of converting DDT by P. aeruginosa 640x is proposed.
