BACKGROUND: CD90 fibroblasts have been described arising from and replacing the
homeostatic CD34 network in scleroderma, but have not been specifically examined 
in other forms of cutaneous fibrosis.
OBJECTIVES: To address expression, timelines, and spatial relationships of CD90, 
CD34, and smooth muscle actin (SMA) expressing fibroblasts in scars and to
examine for the presence of a CD34-to-CD90 transition.
METHODS: One hundred and seventeen scars (reparative/hypertrophic/keloidal) were 
evaluated for CD90, CD34, and SMA expression. Double-staining
immunohistochemistry for CD90/CD34 was performed to identify CD90/CD34
transitioning cells, confirmed by double-color immunofluorescence. In addition,
some scars were double-stained with CD90/SMA, CD90/procollagen-1, or
SMA/procollagen-1 to evaluate spatial relationships and active collagen
synthesis. Expression was graded as diffuse, minority, and negative.
RESULTS: Most scars demonstrate a CD90/CD34 pattern, and dual CD90/CD34
fibroblasts were observed in 91% of scars. In reparative scars, CD90 expression
reverses to a CD34/CD90 state with maturation. Pathologic scars exhibit prolonged
CD90 expression. Both CD90 and SMA fibroblasts collagenize scars, although CD90
fibroblasts are more prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: CD90 fibroblasts likely arise from the resting CD34 fibroblastic
network. Actively collagenizing scar fibroblasts exhibit a CD90/CD34 phenotype,
which is prolonged in pathologic scars. CD90 fibroblasts are likely important
players in cutaneous scarring.
