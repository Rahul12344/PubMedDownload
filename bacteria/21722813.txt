BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The airway epithelium produces antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
that prevent colonization of host tissues by a wide range of pathogens. Human
β-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is one of the most well-documented AMPs in humans. Several
bacterial products can induce production of this peptide. Bacterial
immunostimulants containing bacterial lysates have long been used in the
treatment of respiratory infections, but their effects on hBD-2 release have not 
been investigated. We undertook this study to induce production of hBD-2 after
stimulation of the nasal mucosa with bacterial lysates.
METHODS: A nasal lavage (NL) was performed in 12 healthy volunteers under basal
conditions and after a nasal challenge with separate and subsequent stimuli with 
either bacterial lysates (20 million), cholecalciferol (400 IU), or
sham-challenge with glycerol plus isotonic saline solution. Immunohistochemistry 
was performed in nasal biopsies 48 h after stimulation with bacterial lysates to 
identify the presence of hBD-2.
RESULTS: Increased levels of hBD-2 (4668.99 ± 2829.33 pg/mL) were measured with
ELISA in NL fluids following bacterial challenge. However, hBD-2 concentrations
were below the limit of detection in NL fluids at baseline and after the
administration of cholecalciferol or the sham-challenge. Through
immunohistochemistry, hBD-2 was predominantly localized to the epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS: hBD-2 can be induced in the nasal mucosa after administration of
bacterial lysates. Stimulation of the innate immune system to produce hBD-2 could
be used to prevent or even treat infections caused by respiratory pathogens.
