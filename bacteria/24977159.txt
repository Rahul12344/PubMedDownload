This study aimed to clarify epigenetic and genetic alterations that occur during 
renal carcinogenesis. The original method includes chromosome 3 specific
NotI-microarrays containing 180 NotI-clones associated with 188 genes for
hybridization with 23 paired normal/tumor DNA samples of primary clear cell renal
cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Twenty-two genes showed methylation and/or deletion in
17-57% of tumors. These genes include tumor suppressors or candidates (VHL,
CTDSPL, LRRC3B, ALDH1L1, and EPHB1) and genes that were not previously considered
as cancer-associated (e.g., LRRN1, GORASP1, FGD5, and PLCL2). Bisulfite
sequencing analysis confirmed methylation as a frequent event in ccRCC. A set of 
six markers (NKIRAS1/RPL15, LRRN1, LRRC3B, CTDSPL, GORASP1/TTC21A, and VHL) was
suggested for ccRCC detection in renal biopsies. The mRNA level decrease was
shown for 6 NotI-associated genes in ccRCC using quantitative PCR: LRRN1,
GORASP1, FOXP1, FGD5, PLCL2, and ALDH1L1. The majority of examined genes showed
distinct expression profiles in ccRCC and papillary RCC. The strongest extent and
frequency of downregulation were shown for ALDH1L1 gene both in ccRCC and
papillary RCC. Moreover, the extent of ALDH1L1 mRNA level decrease was more
pronounced in both histological types of RCC stage III compared with stages I and
II (P = 0.03). The same was observed for FGD5 gene in ccRCC (P < 0.06). Dedicated
to thememory of Eugene R. Zabarovsky.
