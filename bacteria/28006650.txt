Conjugate vaccines have reduced pneumococcal disease in vaccinated children and
unvaccinated adults, but non-vaccine serotypes are of concern, particularly if
antibiotic resistant. We reviewed Streptococcus pneumoniae collected via: (i) the
British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) surveillances from
2001-2014; (ii) Public Health England's (PHE) invasive isolate surveillance from 
2005-2014 and (iii) referral to PHE for resistance investigation from 2005-2014. 
Serotype 15A increased in all series, with many representatives showing triple
resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines and penicillin. 15A was consistently
among the 10 most prevalent serotypes from 2011 in PHE and BSAC invasive
isolate/bacteraemia surveillance but never previously; 26-33% of these invasive
15A isolates had triple resistance. BSAC respiratory isolates were only serotyped
in 2013/14 and 2014/15 (October to September); 15A was most prevalent serotype in
both periods, comprising 9-11% of isolates, 38-48% of them with triple
resistance. Serotype 15A represented 0-4% of S. pneumoniae referred to PHE for
reference investigation annually until 2008 but rose to 29% (2013) and 32%
(2014). Almost all multidrug-resistant 15A isolates were sequence type (ST) 63
variants, whereas susceptible 15A isolates were clonally diverse. The rise of
serotype 15A suggests that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines will need ongoing
adaptation.
