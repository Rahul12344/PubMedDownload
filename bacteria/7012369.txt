A new approach to the study of the E. coli nucleoid.

Haggis GH, Bond EF.

E. coli were examined by the freeze-fracture thaw-fix technique, embedded in thin
fibrin gels. After glutaraldehyde fixation the bacterial nucleoid was found
spread out over the surrounding fibrin. Addition of calcium and uranyl acetate to
the fixative preserved the nucleoid in compact form. The spread nucleoid was then
examined against a smooth mica background after freeze-thaw and osmotic lysis.
These spreads were critical-point dried, rotary shadowed with platinum-carbon and
viewed as stereo-pair micrographs. Structures seen are tentatively interpreted as
clusters of polyribosomes, extended DNA, and supercoiled DNA complexed with
proteins or polyamines. After osmotic lysis, glutaraldehyde alone preserves the
nucleoid in compact form. Only where strands are broken, in freeze-fracture or
freeze-thaw lysis, must uranyl acetate be added to the fixative to preserve a
compact structure.
