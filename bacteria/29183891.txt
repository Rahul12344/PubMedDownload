Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease lacking targeted
therapy. In this study, we developed a CAR T cell-based immunotherapeutic
strategy to target TEM8, a marker initially defined on endothelial cells in colon
tumors that was discovered recently to be upregulated in TNBC. CAR T cells were
developed that upon specific recognition of TEM8 secreted immunostimulatory
cytokines and killed tumor endothelial cells as well as TEM8-positive TNBC cells.
Notably, the TEM8 CAR T cells targeted breast cancer stem-like cells, offsetting 
the formation of mammospheres relative to nontransduced T cells. Adoptive
transfer of TEM8 CAR T cells induced regression of established, localized
patient-derived xenograft tumors, as well as lung metastatic TNBC cell
line-derived xenograft tumors, by both killing TEM8+ TNBC tumor cells and
targeting the tumor endothelium to block tumor neovascularization. Our findings
offer a preclinical proof of concept for immunotherapeutic targeting of TEM8 as a
strategy to treat TNBC.Significance: These findings offer a preclinical proof of 
concept for immunotherapeutic targeting of an endothelial antigen that is
overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer and the associated tumor
vasculature. Cancer Res; 78(2); 489-500. ©2017 AACR.
