Analysis of the electrophoretic profiles of whole cell proteins of Campylobacter 
strains from waste water was used to differentiate C. jejuni from C. coli. The
results show, that biotyping of campylobacters from waste water may results in a 
false species differentiation. Some of the Campylobacter strains originally typed
as C. coli, were proved to be atypical C. jejuni strains. Therefore, in addition 
to biotyping and serotyping, electrophoretic typing is recommended to ensure
correct identification of Campylobacter, especially from environmental sources.
