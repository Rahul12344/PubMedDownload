We were confronted recently by an intraluminal colonic explosion during a colonic
polypectomy procedure using snare loop electrocautery, probably caused by the
presence of hydrogen and/or methane in combustible concentrations. Our patient
needed immediate surgery, when several lacerations were found in the colon: a
right hemicolectomy and a partial sigmoid resection with primary anastomoses were
performed. Colonic bacteria, rests of fecal fluids, certain cleansing solutions, 
and oxygen insufflation are the main factors involved in cases of colonic
explosion. We describe this dramatic event in our patient and discuss whether
this complication might be avoidable in the future.
