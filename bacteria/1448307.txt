To determine current opinions among experts in pediatric infectious diseases for 
treatment of bacterial sepsis, meningitis and acute otitis media, we polled
directors of training programs in January, 1992. Responses were received from 69 
centers in the United States and Canada. For initial treatment of presumed
bacterial meningitis, the third generation cephalosporins alone or combined with 
ampicillin have become drugs of choice in all age groups. Most infectious disease
programs include dexamethasone in the management of presumed bacterial meningitis
for children 2 months of age and older. Third generation cephalosporins are also 
drugs of choice for presumed sepsis: combined with ampicillin for infants 5 weeks
of age; used alone for children 5 months and 12 years of age. Amoxicillin remains
the preferred drug for initial treatment of acute otitis media. The combination
of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is favored in the setting of an increased
proportion of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial pathogens. Comparison of these
results with polls in 1987 and 1989 indicates a shift in recommendations of
therapy of presumed bacterial sepsis and meningitis from ampicillin alone or
combined with an aminoglycoside or chloramphenicol to use of a third generation
cephalosporin alone or combined with ampicillin.
