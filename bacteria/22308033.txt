Bacterial translation initiation factor IF2 promotes ribosomal subunit
association, recruitment, and binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosomal P-site and
initiation dipeptide formation. Here, we present the solution structures of
GDP-bound and apo-IF2-G2 of Bacillus stearothermophilus and provide evidence that
this isolated domain binds the 50 S ribosomal subunit and hydrolyzes GTP.
Differences between the free and GDP-bound structures of IF2-G2 suggest that
domain reorganization within the G2-G3-C1 regions underlies the different
structural requirements of IF2 during the initiation process. However, these
structural signals are unlikely forwarded from IF2-G2 to the C-terminal fMet-tRNA
binding domain (IF2-C2) because the connected IF2-C1 and IF2-C2 modules show
completely independent mobility, indicating that the bacterial interdomain
connector lacks the rigidity that was found in the archaeal IF2 homolog aIF5B.
