Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation is being used as an alternative source
of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow reconstitution. Separation and
processing of UCB samples in large numbers for storage in cord blood banks
ideally needs to be partially automated. The aim of this study was to establish
and standardize a method for unrelated cord blood banking as well as the
biological characterization of the samples. Up to October 1999, a total of 938
UCB units (mean volume 84.6 +/- 23.6 ml, nucleated cell (NC) count 0.90 +/- 0.37 
x 109, total CFU-GM 79 +/- 72 x 104, CD34+ cell count 2.46 +/- 2.72 x 106) had
been collected. Twenty-three per cent of all UCB samples had a NC count below 0.4
x 109 and were discarded. The initial bacterial contamination rate was reduced to
less than 5% as a result of extensive training in collection procedures. Using a 
modification of a triple bag system and adding a solution of 6% hydroxyethyl
starch, the UCB was separated by two centrifugation steps into three components: 
buffy coat, red cell and plasma fractions. The overall recoveries for NC, CFU-GM 
and CD34+ cells were 87.4 +/- 8.5%, 88.8 +/- 6.6% and 90.3 +/- 12.4%,
respectively, in a mean final volume of 27 +/- 4.2 ml.
