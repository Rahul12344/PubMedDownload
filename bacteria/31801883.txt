Hormonal therapy targeting androgen receptor (AR) is initially effective to treat
prostate cancer (PCa), but it eventually fails. It has been hypothesized that
cellular heterogeneity of PCa, consisting of AR+ luminal tumor cells and AR-
neuroendocrine (NE) tumor cells, may contribute to therapy failure. Here, we
describe the successful purification of NE cells from primary fresh human
prostate adenocarcinoma based on the cell surface receptor C-X-C motif chemokine 
receptor 2 (CXCR2). Functional studies revealed CXCR2 to be a driver of the NE
phenotype, including loss of AR expression, lineage plasticity, and resistance to
hormonal therapy. CXCR2-driven NE cells were critical for the tumor
microenvironment by providing a survival niche for the AR+ luminal cells. We
demonstrate that the combination of CXCR2 inhibition and AR targeting is an
effective treatment strategy in mouse xenograft models. Such a strategy has the
potential to overcome therapy resistance caused by tumor cell heterogeneity.
