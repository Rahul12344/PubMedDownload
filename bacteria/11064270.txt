To determine the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (P-ExA) on cytokine 
production, we studied cytokine release induced by heat-killed P. aeruginosa
(HKPA) in human whole blood in the presence or absence of P-ExA. P-ExA (0.01-1
microgram ml(-1)) caused a dose-dependent decrease in HKPA-induced production of 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL-) 10, IL-6 and IL-8 (all
P<0.05). P-ExA-induced inhibition of IL-10, IL-6 and IL-8 release was not
dependent on reduced TNF concentrations, since the relative attenuation of the
production of these cytokines was similar in the presence or absence of a
neutralizing anti-TNF antibody. The effect of P-ExA on cytokine production may
offer a disadvantage to the host with respect to clearance of the infection.
