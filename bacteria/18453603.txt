Neisseria gonorrhoeae colony opacity-associated (Opa) proteins bind to human
carcinoembryonic antigen cellular adhesion molecules (CEACAM) found on host cells
including T lymphocytes. Opa binding to CEACAM1 suppresses the activation of
CD4(+) T cells in response to a variety of stimuli. In this study, we use primary
human CD4(+) T cells isolated from peripheral blood to define the molecular
events occurring subsequent to Opa-CEACAM1 binding. We establish that, in
contrast to other cell types, T cells do not engulf N. gonorrhoeae upon CEACAM1
binding. Instead, the bacteria recruit CEACAM1 from intracellular stores and
maintain it on the T cell surface. Upon TCR ligation, the co-engaged CEACAM1
becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within the ITIMs apparent in the
cytoplasmic domain. This allows the recruitment and subsequent activation of the 
src homology domain 2-containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 at the
site of bacterial attachment, which prevents the normal tyrosine phosphorylation 
of the CD3zeta-chain and ZAP-70 kinase in response to TCR engagement. Combined,
this dynamic response allows the bacteria to effectively harness the coinhibitory
function of CEACAM1 to suppress the adaptive immune response at its earliest
step.
