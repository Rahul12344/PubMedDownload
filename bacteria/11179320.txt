The kinetics of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) expression on T cells
responding to Cryptococcus neoformans and its role in regulating the T-cell
response were examined. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with 
encapsulated or acapsular C. neoformans we showed that (i) the encapsulated
strain augmented CTLA-4 expression on the T-cell surface while the acapsular
strain was a weaker modulator, (ii) CTLA-4 molecules were rapidly up-regulated
after the addition of encapsulated C. neoformans, (iii) CTLA-4 was up-regulated
predominantly in CD4+ T cells responding to C. neoformans, and (iv) blockage of
CTLA-4 with (Fab')2 of monoclonal antibody to CTLA-4 induced T-cell proliferation
that paralleled the enhancement of interleukin-2 and gamma interferon production.
These results suggest that capsular material, the major virulence factor of C.
neoformans, promotes synthesis and expression of CTLA-4 molecules predominantly
in CD4+ T cells. CTLA-4-mediated deactivation is due not to lack of costimulation
but to specific recognition of CTLA-4 for B7 molecules. This appears to be a new 
mechanism by which C. neoformans may elude the host immune response.
