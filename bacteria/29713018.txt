Dysregulation of genetic pathways during human germ cell development leads to
infertility. Here, we analysed bona fide human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) to
probe the developmental genetics of human germ cell specification and
differentiation. We examined the distribution of OCT4 occupancy in hPGCs relative
to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We demonstrated that development, from
pluripotent stem cells to germ cells, is driven by switching partners with OCT4
from SOX2 to PAX5 and PRDM1. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that
PAX5 encodes a critical regulator of hPGC development. Moreover, an epistasis
analysis indicated that PAX5 acts upstream of OCT4 and PRDM1. The PAX5-OCT4-PRDM1
proteins form a core transcriptional network that activates germline and
represses somatic programmes during human germ cell differentiation. These
findings illustrate the power of combined genome editing, cell differentiation
and engraftment for probing human developmental genetics that have historically
been difficult to study.
