Degradation of endrin, aldrin, and DDT by soil microorganisms.

Patil KC, Matsumura F, Boush GM.

Twenty microbial cultures which had been shown to degrade dieldrin were tested to
determine their ability to degrade endrin, aldrin, DDT, gamma isomers of
benzenehexachloride (gamma-BHC), and Baygon. All isolates were able to degrade
DDT and endrin, whereas 13 degraded aldrin. However, none of them was able to
degrade Baygon or gamma-BHC.
