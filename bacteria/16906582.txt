BACKGROUND: ZAP-70 has been proposed as a surrogate marker for immunoglobulin
heavy-chain variable region (IgV(H)) mutation status, which is known as a
prognostic marker in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The flow
cytometric analysis of ZAP-70 suffers from difficulties in standardization and
interpretation. We applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test to make
analysis more straightforward.
METHODS: We examined ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry in 53 patients with CLL.
Analysis was performed as initially described by Crespo et al. (New England J Med
2003; 348:1764-1775) and alternatively by application of the KS statistical test 
comparing T cells with B cells. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC)-curve
analyses were performed to determine the optimal cut-off values for ZAP-70
measured by the two approaches. ZAP-70 protein expression was compared with
ZAP-70 mRNA expression measured by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) and with the IgV(H) 
mutation status.
RESULTS: Both flow cytometric analyses correlated well with the molecular
technique and proved to be of equal value in predicting the IgV(H) mutation
status. Applying the KS test is reproducible, simple, straightforward, and
overcomes a number of difficulties encountered in the Crespo-method.
CONCLUSIONS: The KS statistical test is an essential part of the software
delivered with modern routine analytical flow cytometers and is well suited for
analysis of ZAP-70 expression in CLL.
