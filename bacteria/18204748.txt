Four cases of tinea faciei that were observed at the Department of Dermatology of
Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis are reported. All patients were females, ages
54 (patient 1), 38 (patient 2), 30 (patient 3), and 50 (patient 4). The lesions
lasted 1 year, 2 months, 4 months, and 1 month, respectively. Tinea faciei was
initially suspected in three patients, whereas for the second patient eczema was 
initially suspected. She was first treated topically with corticosteroids leading
to exacerbation. Through mycological examination, Trichophyton rubrum was
isolated in three patients, but was negative in patient 2. Three patients
recovered completely after one month of griseofulvin associated with topical
terbinafine. Patient 3 was topically treated because she was pregnant.
Erythematous lesions of the face must be checked for fungi.
