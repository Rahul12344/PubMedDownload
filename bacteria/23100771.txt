Bacterial resistance to arsenical salts encoded on plasmid pI258 occurs by active
extrusion of toxic oxyanions from cells of Staphylococcus aureus. The operon
encodes for three gene products: ArsR, ArsB and ArsC. The gene product of arsB is
an integral membrane protein and it is sufficient to provide resistance to
arsenite and antimonite. A poly His-ArsB fusion protein was generated to purify
the staphylococcal ArsB protein. Cells containing the His-tagged arsB gene were
resistant to arsenite and antimonite. The levels of resistance to these toxic
oxyanions by the His-tagged construct were greater than the levels obtained with 
the wild type gene. These data would indicate that the His-tagged protein is
functionally active. A new 36 kDa protein band was visualized on 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), which was confirmed as the
His-ArsB protein by immunodetection with polyclonal Hisantibodies. The His-ArsB
fusion protein was purified by the use of metal-chelate affinity chromatography
with a Ni(+2)-nitrilotriacetic acid column and size-exclusion chromatography
suggests that the protein was a homodimer.
