The structure of the Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL has been investigated by
tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) under liquid. High-resolution images
can be obtained, which show the up-right position of GroEL adsorbed on mica with 
the substrate-binding site on top. Because of this orientation, the interaction
between GroEL and two substrate proteins, citrate synthase from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae with a destabilizing Gly-->Ala mutation and RTEM beta-lactamase from
Escherichia coli with two Cys-->Ala mutations, could be studied by force
spectroscopy under different conditions. The results show that the interaction
force decreases in the presence of ATP (but not of ATPgammaS) and that the force 
is smaller for native-like proteins than for the fully denatured ones. It also
demonstrates that the interaction energy with GroEL increases with increasing
molecular weight. By measuring the interaction force changes between the
chaperonin and the two different substrate proteins, we could specifically detect
GroEL conformational changes upon nucleotide binding.
