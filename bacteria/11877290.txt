We have characterized a splice variant (isoform) of the human CD28 T cell
costimulatory receptor. The nucleotide sequence of this CD28 isoform was
identical to that of CD28 in the signal peptide, the transmembrane domain, and
the cytoplasmic tail, but it was missing a large segment of the extracellular
ligand-binding domain, which is encoded by the second exon. This isoform (CD28i),
whose message level exceeded 25% of CD28, was a transmembrane homodimer. CD28i
was found noncovalently associated with CD28 and was
tyrosine-phosphorylated/PI3-kinase-complexed following the crosslinking of CD28, 
and the CD28 costimulatory signal was enhanced in T cells expressing CD28i. These
data demonstrate that CD28i, via noncovalent association with CD28, plays a role 
as a costimulatory signal amplifier in human T cells.
