The argH gene encoding argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) of Methanococcus maripaludis
was cloned on a 4.7-kb HindIII genomic fragment. The gene is preceded by a short 
open reading frame (ORF149), which encodes a polypeptide with an unknown
function. The two genes are co-transcribed. The ASL of M. maripaludis shares a
high amino acid identity with ASLs from both bacterial and eukaryal origins and
was able to complement both an argH Escherichia coli mutant and an arg4 yeast
mutant, showing its extraordinary evolutionary conservation. Attempts to create
an argH auxotroph of M. maripaludis by disrupting the genomic allele were
unsuccessful: although a knockout allele of argH was integrated into the M.
maripaludis chromosome by homologous recombination, the intact copy was not
excluded, suggesting that the argH gene is essential.
