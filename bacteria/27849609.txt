The respiratory release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from soil is a major yet poorly
understood flux in the global carbon cycle. Climatic warming is hypothesized to
increase rates of soil respiration, potentially fueling further increases in
global temperatures. However, despite considerable scientific attention in recent
decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming
remains unclear. We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil
respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling >3,800 observations
representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2
decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the
temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in
all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data
provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental
warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple
single-site studies. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates
with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with
soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates
decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in
temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global
temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration,
with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient
temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome
perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical
to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change
with climatic warming.
