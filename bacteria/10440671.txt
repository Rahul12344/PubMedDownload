Synthesis of an operon fusion protein was investigated in batch and fed-batch
cultures at high cell densities of recombinant Escherichia coli JM105
[pBAD-GFP::CAT]. Glucose-limited growth was achieved without accumulation of
inhibitory byproducts allowing high cell densities (110 g L(-1) DCW) to be
attained. This was believed to be the highest reported value for dry cell mass of
E. coli strain JM105 expressing two recombinant proteins. Transcription of the
two reporter genes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT), was under the control of the p(BAD) promoter of the
araBAD (arabinose) operon. Each protein was independently translated via separate
ribosome binding sites. CAT served as a model recombinant protein product to
illustrate the noninvasive quantitative reporting ability of GFP during high cell
density fermentations. Expression of GFP was monitored on-line using an
intensity-based optical sensor. A linear correlation between the on-line GFP
intensity and the enzymatic activity of CAT allowed for in vivo real-time
quantitative monitoring of a fermentation product under conditions of high
biomass concentration and high productivity.
