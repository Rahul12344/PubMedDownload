Though DNA polymerase I (poll) of Escherichia (E.) coli is understood to play a
role in repair synthesis of excision repair, it is still obscure whether DNA
polymerase beta (pol beta) plays a similar role in eukaryotic cells. To estimate 
the role of pol beta in excision repair processes, we inserted the rat pol beta
gene into several mutant E. coli defective in a diverse set of enzymatic
activities of poll. UV resistance was seen only when the 5'----3' exonuclease
(exo) activity of poll molecules remained. Therefore it is suggested that
5'----3' exo activity as well as pol beta activity are essential for repair
synthesis of excision repair in eukaryotic cells.
