Hospital hydrotherapy pools treated with ultra violet light: bad bacteriological 
quality and presence of thermophilic Naegleria.

De Jonckheere JF.

The microbiological quality of eight halogenated and two u.v.-treated
hydrotherapy pools in hospitals was investigated. The microbiological quality of 
halogenated hydrotherapy pools was comparable to halogenated public swimming
pools, although in some Pseudomonas aeruginosa and faecal pollution indicators
were more frequent due to bad management. On the other hand u.v.-treated
hydrotherapy pools had very bad microbiological quality. Apart from faecal
pollution indicators, P. aeruginosa was present in very high numbers. Halogenated
hydrotherapy pools were not highly contaminated with amoebae, and Naegleria spp. 
were never detected. On the other hand u.v.-treated pools contained very high
numbers of thermophilic Naegleria. The Naegleria isolated were identified as N.
lovaniensis, a species commonly found in association with N. fowleri. Isoenzyme
analysis showed a different type of N. lovaniensis was present in each of two
u.v.-treated pools.
