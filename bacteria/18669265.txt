Biological corrosion of ADO quality aluminum and aluminum-based construction
materials (alloys V65, D16, and D16T) was studied. Thirteen microscopic fungus
species and six bacterial species proved to be able to attack aluminum and its
alloys. It was found that biocorrosion of metals by microscopic fungi and
bacteria was mediated by certain exometabolites. Experiments on biocorrosion of
the materials by the microscopic fungus Alternaria alternata, the most active
biodegrader, demonstrated that the micromycete attack started with the appearance
of exudate with pH 8-9 on end faces of the samples.
