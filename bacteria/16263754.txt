To elucidate the role of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation along with the
intracellular signaling pathways triggered by CpG DNA in CD34+ cells, we
investigated whether synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), containing
unmethylated CpG motifs, could induce IL-8 expression in CD34+ cells through
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)
pathway. We demonstrated evidence for the first time that CD34+ cells
constitutively expressed TLR9. Exposure of the cells to CpG ODN resulted in a
time- and dose-dependent increase of IL-8 expression, and activation of
phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated p38. In addition, CpG ODN stimulated
AP-1, but not NF-kappaB, signals. Moreover, inhibitors of MAPK (U0126 and
SB203580) significantly reduced the IL-8 production, while the inhibition of
NF-kappaB (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and retrovirus containing dominant-negative
IkappaB alpha plasmid) did not affect the IL-8 expression increased by CpG ODN.
Moreover, co-stimulation with LPS and CpG synergistically up-regulates IL-8 in
CD34+ cells. These results suggest that CpG DNA, acting on TLR9, activates CD34+ 
cells to express IL-8 through MAPK-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent pathways.
