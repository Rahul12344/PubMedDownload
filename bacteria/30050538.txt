Overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) is linked with immunopathology of
several autoimmune disorders including celiac disease. Here, we utilized an
anti-human IL-15 antibody 04H04 (anti-IL-15) to reverse immunopathogenesis of
celiac disease. Anti-IL-15 was administered to six gluten-sensitive rhesus
macaques with celiac disease characteristics including gluten-sensitive
enteropathy (GSE), and the following celiac-related metrics were evaluated:
morphology (villous height/crypt depth ratio) of small intestine, counts of
intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, IFN-γ-producing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells,
plasma levels of anti-gliadin and anti-intestinal tissue transglutaminase IgG
antibodies, as well as peripheral effector memory (CD3+CD28-CD95+) T cells.
Anti-IL-15 treatment reversed the clinically relevant disease endpoints,
intraepithelial lymphocyte counts, and villous height/crypt depth ratios within
jejunal biopsies to normal levels (P < 0.001). Additionally, intestinal CD8+ and 
CD4+ T cell IFN-γ production was reduced (P < 0.05). Extra-intestinally,
anti-IL-15 treatment reduced peripheral NK cell counts (P < 0.001), but
otherwise, non-NK peripheral lymphocytes including effector memory T cells and
serum blood chemistry were unaffected. Overall, providing the beneficial
disease-modulatory and immunomodulatory effects observed, anti-IL-15 treatment
might be considered as a novel therapy to normalize intestinal lymphocyte
function in celiac disease patients with GSE.
