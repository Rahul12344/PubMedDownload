1. FAQ: E. Coli: Good, Bad, & Deadly: “What is true for E. coli is true for the

Washington (DC): American Society for Microbiology; 2011.
American Academy of Microbiology FAQ Reports.

report the larger story of E. coli is told: its role in human health, in food,
and even in our understanding of our own biology.
