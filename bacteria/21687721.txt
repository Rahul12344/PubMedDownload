Treatment?

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a defect in the CF transmembrane regulator that
leads to depletion and dehydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL) of the lung
epithelium, providing an environment that can be infected by bacteria leading to 
increased morbidity and mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronically infects
more than 80% of CF patients and one hallmark of infection is the emergence of a 
mucoid phenotype associated with a worsening prognosis and more rapid decline in 
lung function. Hypertonic saline (HS) is a clinically proven treatment that
improves mucociliary clearance through partial rehydration of the ASL of the
lung. Strikingly, while HS therapy does not alter the prevalence of P. aeruginosa
in the CF lung it does decrease the frequency of episodes of acute, severe
illness known as infective exacerbations among CF patients. In this article, we
propose a hypothesis whereby the positive clinical effects of HS treatment are
explained by the osmotic sensitivity of the mucoid sub-population of P.
aeruginosa in the CF lung leading to selection against this group in favor of the
osmotically resistant non-mucoid variants.
