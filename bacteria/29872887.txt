In our search for thermophilic and acid-tolerant nucleoside
2'-deoxyribosyltransferases (NDTs), we found a good candidate in an enzyme
encoded by Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 (CtNDT). Biophysical and
biochemical characterization revealed CtNDT as a homotetramer endowed with good
activity and stability at both high temperatures (50-100 °C) and a wide range of 
pH values (from 3 to 7). CtNDT recognizes purine bases and their corresponding
2'-deoxynucleosides but is also proficient using cytosine and 2'-deoxycytidine as
substrates. These unusual features preclude the strict classification of CtNDT as
either a type I or a type II NDT and further suggest that this simple subdivision
may need to be updated in the future. Our findings also hint at a possible link
between oligomeric state and NDT's substrate specificity. Interestingly from a
practical perspective, CtNDT displays high activity (80-100%) in the presence of 
several water-miscible co-solvents in a proportion of up to 20% and was
successfully employed in the enzymatic production of several therapeutic
nucleosides such as didanosine, vidarabine, and cytarabine.
