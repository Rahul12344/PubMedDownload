An outbreak of plague occurred in Hlegu Town, Burma in February and March 1977.
Altogether 14 bubonic plague cases, with 2 deaths were reported, mostly children 
under 15 years of age. Twice as many males as females were affected. A
retrospective investigation showed that a rat fall took place in the last week of
January. Only 9.5% of the rodents which died in the epizootic were found to be
infected with Y. pestis; this apparent low infection rate probably resulted from 
the inclusion in the survey of some dead rats which died of other causes. 14.5%
out of 48 trapped rodents were found to be serologically positive. The general
flea and cheopis indices were rather high, perhaps because fleas were found to be
partially resistant to DDT and also because spraying of insecticide did not
effect fleas on the hosts. The cheopis index in Hlegu Town was 1.17, and less
than 0.5 in Hlegu suburb (Yankin-Yat) where no epizootic was reported. An active 
case search revealed 76 suspected plague cases out of which 11 were found to have
bubonic plague. A field trial showed that plague vaccination during the outbreak 
did not result in a rise of detectable antibodies in persons inoculated.
