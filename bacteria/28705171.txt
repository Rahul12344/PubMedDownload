BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota of breast-fed and formula-fed infants differ
significantly, as do the risks for allergies, gut dysfunction, and upper
respiratory tract infections. The connections between breast milk, various
formulas, and the profiles of gut bacteria to these childhood illnesses, as well 
as the mechanisms underlying the effects, are not well understood.
METHODS: We investigated distal colon microbiota by 16S RNA amplicon sequencing, 
morphology by histomorphometry, immune response by cytokine expression, and
tryptophan metabolism in a pig model in which piglets were sow-fed, or fed soy or
dairy milk-based formula from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 21.
RESULTS: Formula feeding significantly (p < 0.05) altered the colon microbiota
relative to the sow feeding. A significant reduction in microbial diversity was
noted with formula groups in comparison to sow-fed. Streptococcus, Blautia,
Citrobacter, Butrycimonas, Parabacteroides, Lactococcus genera were increased
with formula feeding relative to sow feeding. In addition, relative to sow
feeding, Anaerotruncus, Akkermansia, Enterococcus, Acinetobacter,
Christensenella, and Holdemania were increased in milk-fed piglets, and
Biliophila, Ruminococcus, Clostridium were increased in soy-fed piglets. No
significant gut morphological changes were noted. However, higher cytokine mRNA
expression (BMP4, CCL11, CCL21) was observed in the distal colon of formula
groups. Formula feeding reduced enterochromaffin cell number and serotonin, but
increased tryptamine levels relative to sow feeding.
CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that formula diet alters the colon microbiota and
appears to shift tryptophan metabolism from serotonin to tryptamine, which may
lead to greater histamine levels and risk of allergies in infants.
