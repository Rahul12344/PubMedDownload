Importance: Cellulitis is a commonly occurring skin and soft tissue infection and
one of the most frequently seen dermatological diseases in the intensive care
unit (ICU). However, clinical characteristics of patients with cellulitis
requiring intensive care treatment are poorly defined. Necrotizing fasciitis is
often confused for cellulitis at initial presentation and is considered to be
more severe and thus has previously been described in more detail.
Objective: To describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with
ICU-necessitating cellulitis and to compare them with patients with necrotizing
fasciitis.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study includes all ICU
admissions from 2 tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Of 2562 sepsis
admissions, 101 had possible, probable, or definite cellulitis or soft tissue
infections. Retrospective review identified severe cellulitis was the reason for 
ICU admission in 23 patients, necrotizing fasciitis in 31 patients, and other
diagnoses in 47 patients.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient and disease characteristics, cultured
pathogens, lengths of stay, and short-term and long-term mortality.
Results: Overall, 54 patients with cellulitis (n = 23; mean [SD] age, 57.2 [17.7]
years) or necrotizing fasciitis (n = 31; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [13.5]) were
included in this study. Patients with cellulitis were found to be less severely
ill than patients with necrotizing fasciitis. This is reflected in rates of shock
(7 [30.4%] vs 19 [61.3%]; P = .03), need for mechanical ventilation (12 [52.2%]
vs 19 [93.5%]; P = .003) and slightly lower mean Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment scores (8 vs 10; P = .046). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV scores did not differ significantly
(82 [75-98] vs 76 [70-96]; P = .16). Patients with cellulitis had more chronic
comorbidities than patients with necrotizing fasciitis (20 [87.0%] vs 17 [54.8%];
P = .02), especially cardiovascular insufficiencies (10 [43.5%] vs 4 [12.9%];
P = .02) and immunodeficiencies (9 [39.1%] vs 3 [9.7%]; P = .02). Among patients 
with cellulitis and patients with patients with necrotizing fasciitis,
Staphylococcus aureus (10 [43.5%] vs 4 [12.9%]; P = .02), Streptococcus pyogenes 
(2 [8.7%] vs 19 [61.3%]; P < .001) and Escherichia coli (4 [17.4%] vs 5 [16.2%]; 
P = .90) were the most frequently observed pathogens. Median (IQR) length of ICU 
stay was shorter for patients with cellulitis vs patients with necrotizing
fasciitis (3 [2-5] vs 5 [3-11]; P = .01), while median (IQR) hospital length of
stay did not differ significantly (22 [10.25-32] vs 36 [14.25-40]; P = .16); and 
the in-hospital mortality rate (26.1% vs 22.6%, P > .99) and 90-day mortality
rate (30.4% vs 22.6%; P = .54) were similar.
Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with cellulitis patients are seldom admitted 
to the ICU. However, while these patients are less critically ill on admission
than patients with necrotizing fasciitis, they have more chronic comorbidities
and most notably similar short-term and long-term mortality.
