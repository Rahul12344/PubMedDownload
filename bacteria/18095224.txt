Polymyxin B and colistin are being used increasingly for the treatment of
infections caused by gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to all other
currently available antibiotics. Although the polymyxins have been available in
the clinic for around 50 years, they have never been subjected to the drug
development procedures required of modern pharmaceuticals. As a result, the
available knowledge on the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and
toxicodynamics (TD) of the polymyxins is limited. Although significant advances
have been made in the last 5 years or so, there are still large gaps in our
understanding of the PK, PD, and TD, and of the PK/PD and PK/TD relationships.
This information is required to generate recommendations on dosage regimens for
various categories of critically ill patients. This paper reviews the growing
understanding of the pharmacology of the polymyxins and factors that may impact
on the optimization of the dose of these antibiotics in critically ill patients.
