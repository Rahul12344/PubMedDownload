The Escherichia coli methylation-independent repair pathway specific for A/G
mismatches has been shown to require the gene product of micA. Extracts prepared 
from micA mutants do not form an A/G mismatch-specific DNA-protein complex and do
not contain an A/G mismatch-specific nicking activity. Moreover, a partially
purified protein fraction containing both A/G mismatch-specific nicking and
binding activities restores repair activity in micA mutant extracts. The DNA
sequence of a 2.3-kb fragment containing the micA gene has been determined. There
are two open reading frames (ORF) in this DNA fragment: one ORF encodes a
25.7-kDa protein whose function is still unknown, the other ORF codes for a
protein with an Mr of 39,147, but this ORF can be transcribed and the mRNA can be
translated to yield a protein with an apparent Mr of 36 kDa on a sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Deletion analysis showed that this 39.1-kDa ORF is
the micA gene as judged by the capacity of the encoded protein to restore the A/G
mismatch-specific nicking activity of micA mutant extracts. Furthermore, our
results suggest that micA is the same gene as the closely mapped mutY, which
encodes the A/G mismatch-specific glycosylase.
