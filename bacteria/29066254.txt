The selective modulation of immunity is an emerging concept driven by the vast
advances in our understanding of this crucial host defense system. Invertebrates 
have raised researchers' interest as potential sources of new bioactive molecules
owing to their antibacterial, anticancer and immunomodulatory activities. A
LipoPolySaccharide (LPS) challenge in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis generates
the transcript, Ci8 short, with cis-regulatory elements in the 3' UTR region that
are essential for shaping innate immune responses. The derived amino acidic
sequence in silico analysis showed specific binding to human Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and Class II alleles. The role of Ci8
short peptide was investigated in a more evolved immune system using human
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) as in vitro model. The biological
activities of this molecule include the activation of 70kDa TCR ζ chain
Associated Protein kinase (ZAP-70) and T Cell Receptor (TCR) Vβ oligo clonal
selection on CD4+ T lymphocytes as well as increased proliferation and IFN-γ
secretion. Furthermore Ci8 short affects CD4+/CD25high induced regulatory T cells
(iTreg) subset selection which co-expressed the functional markers TGF-β1/Latency
Associated Protein (LAP) and CD39/CD73. This paper describes a new molecule that 
modulates important responses of the human adaptive immune system.
