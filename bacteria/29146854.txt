Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains RM11060, serotype 6,8:d:-, and
RM11065, serotype 6,8:-:e,n,z15, were isolated from environmental samples
collected in central California in 2009. We report the complete genome sequences 
of these two strains. These genomic sequences are distinct and will provide
additional data to our understanding of S.Â enterica genomics.
