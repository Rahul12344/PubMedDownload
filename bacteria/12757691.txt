BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a major parasitic disease, increasingly imported
into temperate climates by immigrants from and travelers to endemic areas.
METHOD: To generate valid data on imported infectious diseases to Europe and to
recognize trends over time, the European Network on Imported Infectious Diseases 
Surveillance (TropNetEurop) was founded in 1999. Three hundred and thirty-three
reports of schistosomiasis were analyzed for epidemiologic and clinical features.
RESULTS: Male patients accounted for 64% of all cases. The average age of all
patients was 29.5 years. The majority of patients were of European origin (53%). 
Europeans traveled predominantly for tourism (52%). Main reasons for travel for
people from endemic areas were immigration and refuge (51%) and visits to
relatives and friends (28%). The majority of infections were acquired in Africa; 
92 infections were clearly attributable to Schistosoma haematobium, 130 to
Schistosoma mansoni, and 4 to Schistosoma intercalatum. Praziquantel was the only
treatment used. No deaths were recorded.
CONCLUSION: TropNetEurop sentinel provides valuable epidemiologic and clinical
data on imported schistosomiasis to Europe.
