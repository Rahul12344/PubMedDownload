Ochrobactrum tritici SCII24T bacteria is an environmental strain with high
capacity to resist to arsenic (As) toxicity, which makes it able to grow in the
presence of As(III). The inactivation of the two functional arsenite efflux
pumps, ArsB and ACR3_1, resulted in the mutant O. tritici As5 exhibiting a high
accumulation of arsenite. This work describes a method for the immobilization of 
the mutant cells O. tritici As5, on a commercial polymeric net after sputtered
modified by the deposition of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) thin films, and
demonstrates the capacity of immobilized cells to accumulate arsenic from
solutions. Six different set of deposition parameters for PTFE thin films were
developed and tested in vitro regarding their ability to immobilize the bacterial
cells. The surface that exhibited a mild zeta potential value, hydrophobic
characteristics, the lowest surface free energy but with a high polar component
and the appropriate ratio of chemical reactive groups allowed cells to
proliferate and to grow as a biofilm. These immobilized cells maintained their
ability to accumulate the surrounding arsenite, making it a great arsenic
biofilter to be used in bioremediation processes.
