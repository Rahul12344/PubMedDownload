Gut microbial transformations of flavonoids, an enormous class of polyphenolic
compounds abundant in plant-based diets, are closely associated with human
health. However, the enzymes that initiate the gut microbial metabolism of
flavones and flavonols, the two most abundant groups of flavonoids, as well as
their underlying molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we
discovered a flavone reductase (FLR) from the gut bacterium, Flavonifractor
plautii ATCC 49531 (originally assigned as Clostridium orbiscindens DSM 6740),
which specifically catalyses the hydrogenation of the C2-C3 double bond of
flavones/flavonols and initiates their metabolism as a key step. Crystal
structure analysis revealed the molecular basis for the distinct catalytic
property of FLR. Notably, FLR and its widespread homologues represent a class of 
ene-reductases that has not been previously identified. Genetic and biochemical
analyses further indicated the importance of FLR in gut microbial consumption of 
dietary and medicinal flavonoids, providing broader insight into gut microbial
xenobiotic transformations and possible guidance for personalized nutrition and
medicine.
