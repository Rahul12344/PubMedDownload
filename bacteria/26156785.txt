Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Granzymes (gzms) are proteases mainly found in cytotoxic lymphocytes, but also
extracellularly. While the role of gzms in target cell death has been widely
characterized, considerable evidence points towards broader roles related to
infectious and inflammatory responses. To investigate the expression of the gzms 
in TB, intracellular gzms A, B and K were measured by flow cytometry in
lymphocyte populations from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 TB
patients and 12 healthy donors from Bangladesh, and extracellular levels of gzmA 
and B were measured in serum from 58 TB patients and 31 healthy controls. TB
patients showed increased expression of gzmA in CD8(+) T, CD4(+) T and CD56(+) T,
but not NK, cells, and of gzmB in CD8(+) T cells, when compared to controls. GzmK
expression was not altered in TB patients in any lymphocyte subset. The
extracellular levels of gzmA and, to a lesser extent, of gzmB, were increased in 
TB patients, but did not correlate with intracellular gzm expression in
lymphocyte subsets. Our results reveal enhanced intra- and extracellular
expression of gzmA and B in patients with pulmonary TB, suggesting that gzms are 
part of the host response to tuberculosis.
