The epigenetic clock, defined as the DNA methylome age (DNAmAge), is a candidate 
biomarker of ageing. In this study, we aimed to characterize the behaviour of
this marker during the human lifespan in more detail using two follow-up cohorts 
(the Young Finns study, calendar age i.e. cAge range at baseline 15-24 years,
25-year-follow-up, N = 183; The Vitality 90+ study, cAge range at baseline
19-90 years, 4-year-follow-up, N = 48). We also aimed to assess the relationship 
between DNAmAge estimate and the blood cell distributions, as both of these
measures are known to change as a function of age. The subjects' DNAmAges were
determined using Horvath's calculator of epigenetic cAge. The estimate of the DNA
methylome age acceleration (Δ-cAge-DNAmAge) demonstrated remarkable stability in 
both cohorts: the individual rank orders of the DNAmAges remained largely
unchanged during the follow-ups. The blood cell distributions also demonstrated
significant intra-individual correlation between the baseline and follow-up time 
points. Interestingly, the immunosenescence-associated features (CD8+CD28- and
CD4+CD28- cell proportions and the CD4/CD8 cell ratio) were tightly associated
with the estimate of the DNA methylome age. In summary, our data demonstrate that
the general level of Δ-cAge-DNAmAge is fixed before adulthood and appears to be
quite stationary thereafter, even in the oldest-old ages. Moreover, the blood
DNAmAge estimate seems to be tightly associated with ageing-associated shifts in 
blood cell composition, especially with those that are the hallmarks of
immunosenescence. Overall, these observations contribute to the understanding of 
the longitudinal aspects of the DNAmAge estimate.
