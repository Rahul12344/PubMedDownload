Macroautophagy/autophagy plays a role in unconventional secretion of leaderless
cytosolic proteins. Whether and how secretory autophagy diverges from
conventional degradative autophagy is unclear. We have shown that the
prototypical secretory autophagy cargo IL1B/IL-1β (interleukin 1 β) is recognized
by TRIM16, and that this first to be identified secretory autophagy receptor
interacts with the R-SNARE SEC22B to jointly deliver cargo to the
MAP1LC3B-II-positive sequestration membranes. Cargo secretion is unaffected by
knockdowns of STX17, a SNARE catalyzing autophagosome-lysosome fusion as a
prelude to cargo degradation. Instead, SEC22B in combination with plasma membrane
syntaxins completes cargo secretion. Thus, secretory autophagy diverges from
degradative autophagy by using specialized receptors and a dedicated SNARE
machinery to bypass fusion with lysosomes.
