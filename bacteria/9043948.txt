The mechanisms involved in the maintenance of staphylococcal enterotoxin B
(SEB)-induced T cell anergy are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CD4+
T cell anergy induced by SEB treatment is under partial B cell control. This
effect is not mediated by anti-SEB antibodies or any in vitro B cell-produced
suppresser factor. At day 13 after SEB immunization, T cells from B
cell-deficient mice proliferate upon in vitro stimulation with SEB. These results
suggest that SEB-induced T cell anergy is reversible and that B cells have an
important function in anergy maintenance in CD4+ T cells, both in vivo and in
vitro.
