Base excision repair is the system used from bacteria to man to remove the tens
of thousands of endogenous DNA damages produced daily in each human cell. Base
excision repair is required for normal mammalian development and defects have
been associated with neurological disorders and cancer. In this paper we provide 
an overview of short patch base excision repair in humans and summarize current
knowledge of defects in base excision repair in mouse models and functional
studies on short patch base excision repair germ line polymorphisms and their
relationship to cancer. The biallelic germ line mutations that result in
MUTYH-associated colon cancer are also discussed.
