Natural killer (NK) cells are an important component of the immediate immune
response to infections, including infection by intracellular bacteria. We have
investigated recognition of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) by NK cells and show that 
these cells are activated to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma when peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) are stimulated with CT organisms. Furthermore, infection
of epithelial cell lines with CT renders them susceptible to lysis by human NK
cells. Susceptibility was observed 18-24 h following infection and required
protein synthesis by the infecting chlamydiae, but not by the host cell; heat or 
UV inactivated chlamydiae did not induce susceptibility to NK cell lysis. CT
infection was also shown to decrease the expression of classical and
non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on infected cells,
thus allowing recognition by NK cells when combined with an activating signal. A 
candidate activating signal is MICA/B, which was shown to be expressed
constitutively on epithelial cells.
