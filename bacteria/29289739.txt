BACKGROUND: The impact of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching on outcomes in
liver transplantation is controversial. Varying levels of HLA matching
resolutions were examined in a uniform patient population with no pre-transplant 
DSA from a small, single center cohort.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review from a single center yielded 131 patients, 67
of which were confirmed to be DSA negative, all of which received induction
immunotherapy and post-operative immunosuppression. HLA typing was achieved by
sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP) method using LABType® kits. Eplet 
mismatch analysis was conducted using HLAMatchMaker software.
RESULTS: The mean number of HLA-A antigen mismatches was significantly higher in 
patients experiencing acute rejection (1.8 vs 1.6, p = 0.006). Rejection patients
more frequently possessed two HLA-A mismatches compared to their non-rejection
counterparts (77% vs 43%, p = 0.071). Patient survival was found to be
non-significantly decreased in patients with a higher eplet mismatch load at the 
HLA-A locus (p = 0.155). No other loci were found to be predictive.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, HLA mismatches were found to increase acute rejection 
and be associated with decreased patient survival. The outcomes of this study
suggest an involvement of HLA-A locus mismatches in predicting liver transplant
rejection and patient survival.
