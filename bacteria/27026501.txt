Streptococcus pneumoniae produces pneumolysin toxin as a key virulence factor
against host cells. Pneumolysin is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) toxin 
that forms lytic pores in host membranes and mediates pneumococcal disease
pathogenesis by modulating inflammatory responses. Here, we show that
pneumolysin, which is released during bacterial lysis, induces DNA double strand 
breaks (DSBs), as indicated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated H2AX 
phosphorylation (γH2AX). Pneumolysin-induced γH2AX foci recruit mediator of DNA
damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), to sites of DSBs.
Importantly, results show that toxin-induced DNA damage precedes cell cycle
arrest and causes apoptosis when DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)-mediated
non-homologous end joining is inhibited. Further, we observe that cells that were
undergoing DNA replication harbored DSBs in greater frequency during pneumolysin 
treatment. This observation raises the possibility that DSBs might be arising as 
a result of replication fork breakdown. Additionally, neutralizing the
oligomerization domain of pneumolysin with monoclonal antibody suppresses DNA
damage and also cell cycle arrest, indicating that pneumolysin oligomerization is
important for causing DNA damage. Taken together, this study reveals a previously
unidentified ability of pneumolysin to induce cytotoxicity via DNA damage, with
implications in the pathophysiology of S. pneumoniae infection.
