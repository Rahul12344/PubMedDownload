B10 cells can regulate inflammatory responses in innate immunity. Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) play an important role in B cell-mediated immune responses in
periodontal disease. This study aimed to determine the effects of TLR-activated
B10 cells on periodontal bone loss in experimental periodontitis. Spleen B cells 
isolated from C57BL/6J mice were cultured with Porphyromonas gingivalis
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytosine-phospho-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides
for 48 h. B10-enriched CD1dhi CD5+ B cells were sorted by flow cytometry and were
adoptively transferred to recipient mice through tail vein injection. At the same
time, P. gingivalis-soaked ligatures were placed subgingivally around the
maxillary second molars and remained there for 2 weeks before the mice were
euthanized. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production and the percentage of CD1dhi CD5+ B
cells were significantly increased with treatment with P. gingivalis LPS plus CpG
compared to those in mice treated with P. gingivalis LPS or CpG alone. Mice with 
CD1dhi CD5+ B cell transfer demonstrated reduced periodontal bone loss compared
to the no-transfer group and the group with CD1dlo CD5- B cell transfer. Gingival
IL-10 mRNA expression was significantly increased, whereas expressions of
receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG), tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β were significantly inhibited in the CD1dhi CD5+ B
cell transfer group. The percentages of CD19+ IL-10+ cells, CD19+ CD1dhi CD5+
cells, and P. gingivalis-binding CD19+ cells were significantly higher in
recovered mononuclear cells from gingival tissues of the CD1dhi CD5+ B cell
transfer group than in tissues of the no-transfer group and the CD1dlo CD5- B
cell transfer group. This study indicated that the adoptive transfer of B10 cells
alleviated periodontal inflammation and bone loss in experimental periodontitis
in mice.
