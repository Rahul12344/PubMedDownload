Rising resistance against current antibiotics necessitates the development of
antibacterial agents with alternative targets. The "switch region" of RNA
polymerase (RNAP), addressed by the myxopyronins, could be such a novel target
site. Based on a hit candidate discovered by virtual screening, a small library
of 5-phenyl-3-ureidothiophene-2-carboxylic acids was synthesized resulting in
compounds with increased RNAP inhibition. Hansch analysis revealed π
(lipophilicity constant) and σ (Hammet substituent constant) of the substituents 
at the 5-phenyl moiety to be crucial for activity. The binding mode was proven by
the targeted introduction of a moiety mimicking the enecarbamate side chain of
myxopyronin into the hit compound, accompanied by enhanced RNAP inhibitory
potency. The new compounds displayed good antibacterial activities against Gram
positive bacteria and Gram negative Escherichia coli TolC and a reduced
resistance frequency compared to the established antibiotic rifampicin.
