The synthesis and structure of linear multimeric plasmid molecules (hmw DNA) in
Bacillus subtilis were investigated. The replication of
covalently-closed-circular supercoiled (form I) DNA requires the rate-limiting
plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein. Unlike form I, hmw DNA synthesis 
is partially resistant to inhibition of cellular transcription or translation and
requires the host DnaB protein. In addition, hmw DNA synthesis involves host
recombination and repair functions (RecE and Poll). Analysis of hmw DNA by
electron microscopy displayed linear DNA molecules up to 100 kb in size, which
were either single-stranded, double-stranded or double-stranded with
single-stranded ends. Structural features of hmw DNA molecules were mapped by
means of heteroduplex studies using defined strand-specific probes. The results
suggest that a recombination intermediate, but not plasmid-encoded replication,
is involved in the initiation of hmw DNA synthesis.
