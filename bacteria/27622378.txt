GOAL: The aim of this study was to assess fecal microbiota and metabolome in a
population with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD).
BACKGROUND: Whether intestinal microbiota and metabolic profiling may be altered 
in patients with SUDD is unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool samples from 44 consecutive women [15 patients with
SUDD, 13 with asymptomatic diverticulosis (AD), and 16 healthy controls (HCs)]
were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify targeted 
microorganisms. High-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
associated with multivariate analysis with partial least-square discriminant
analysis (PLS-DA) was applied on the metabolite data set.
RESULTS: The overall bacterial quantity did not differ among the 3 groups
(P=0.449), with no difference in Bacteroides/Prevotella, Clostridium coccoides,
Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli subgroups. The amount of
Akkermansia muciniphila species was significantly different between HC, AD, and
SUDD subjects (P=0.017). PLS-DA analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance -based
metabolomics associated with microbiological data showed significant
discrimination between HCs and AD patients (R=0.733; Q=0.383; P<0.05, LV=2). PLS 
analysis showed lower N-acetyl compound and isovalerate levels in AD, associated 
with higher levels of A. municiphila, as compared with the HC group. PLS-DA
applied on AD and SUDD samples showed a good discrimination between these 2
groups (R=0.69; Q=0.35; LV=2). SUDD patients were characterized by low levels of 
valerate, butyrate, and choline and by high levels of N-acetyl derivatives and
U1.
CONCLUSIONS: SUDD and AD do not show colonic bacterial overgrowth, but a
significant difference in the levels of fecal A. muciniphila was observed.
Moreover, increasing expression of some metabolites as expression of different AD
and SUDD metabolic activity was found.
