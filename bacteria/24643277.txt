iRHOM2 is a highly conserved, catalytically inactive member of the Rhomboid
family, which has recently been shown to regulate the maturation of the
multi-substrate ectodomain sheddase enzyme ADAM17 (TACE) in macrophages. Dominant
iRHOM2 mutations are the cause of the inherited cutaneous and oesophageal
cancer-susceptibility syndrome tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), suggesting 
a role for this protein in epithelial cells. Here, using tissues derived from TOC
patients, we demonstrate that TOC-associated mutations in iRHOM2 cause an
increase in the maturation and activity of ADAM17 in epidermal keratinocytes,
resulting in significantly upregulated shedding of ADAM17 substrates, including
EGF-family growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This activity is
accompanied by increased EGFR activity, increased desmosome processing and the
presence of immature epidermal desmosomes, upregulated epidermal transglutaminase
activity and heightened resistance to Staphylococcal infection in TOC
keratinocytes. Many of these features are consistent with the presence of a
constitutive wound-healing-like phenotype in TOC epidermis, which may shed light 
on a novel pathway in skin repair, regeneration and inflammation.
