In addition to well-defined DNA repair pathways, all living organisms have
evolved mechanisms to avoid cell death caused by replication fork collapse at a
site where replication is blocked due to disruptive covalent modifications of
DNA. The term DNA damage tolerance (DDT) has been employed loosely to include a
collection of mechanisms by which cells survive replication-blocking lesions with
or without associated genomic instability. Recent genetic analyses indicate that 
DDT in eukaryotes, from yeast to human, consists of two parallel pathways with
one being error-free and another highly mutagenic. Interestingly, in budding
yeast, these two pathways are mediated by sequential modifications of the
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by two ubiquitination complexes
Rad6-Rad18 and Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5. Damage-induced monoubiquitination of PCNA by
Rad6-Rad18 promotes translesion synthesis (TLS) with increased mutagenesis, while
subsequent polyubiquitination of PCNA at the same K164 residue by Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5
promotes error-free lesion bypass. Data obtained from recent studies suggest that
the above mechanisms are conserved in higher eukaryotes. In particular, mammals
contain multiple specialized TLS polymerases. Defects in one of the TLS
polymerases have been linked to genomic instability and cancer.
