and cytosolic proteases.

Although multiple components of the class I MHC processing pathway have been
elucidated, the participation of nonproteasomal cytosolic enzymes has been
largely unexplored. In this study, we provide evidence for multiple cytosolic
mechanisms in the generation of an HLA-A*0201-associated epitope from tyrosinase.
This epitope is presented in two isoforms containing either Asn or Asp, depending
on the structure of the tyrosinase precursor. We show that deamidation of Asn to 
Asp is dependent on glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and
subsequent deglycosylation by peptide-N-glycanase in the cytosol. Epitope
precursors with N-terminal extensions undergo a similar process. This is linked
to an inability of ER aminopeptidase 1 to efficiently remove N-terminal residues,
necessitating processing by nonproteasomal peptidases in the cytosol. Our work
demonstrates that processing of this tyrosinase epitope involves recycling
between the ER and cytosol, and an obligatory interplay between enzymes involved 
in proteolysis and glycosylation/deglycosylation located in both compartments.
