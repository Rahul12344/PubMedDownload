The development of novel vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis recently gained 
momentum by the generation of penta-acylated lpxL1 LPS which has similar adjuvant
activity, but reduced endotoxic activity as compared to hexa-acylated wild type
(H44/76) LPS. We investigated the costimulation requirements for the adjuvant
activity of both forms of LPS by immunizing CD28-, ICOS- and
B7.1/2/ICOS-deficient mice. Both ICOS and CD28 appeared essential for optimal
adjuvant activity of H44/76 LPS or lpxL1 LPS. Interestingly, ICOS-mediated
costimulation predominates in the adjuvant activity of lpxL1 LPS, while both ICOS
and CD28 are required for H44/76 LPS adjuvant activity.
