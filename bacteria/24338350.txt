Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major human pathogen causing
pneumonia, sepsis and bacterial meningitis. Using a clinical phenotype based
approach with bacterial whole-genome sequencing we identified pneumococcal
arginine biosynthesis genes to be associated with outcome in patients with
pneumococcal meningitis. Pneumococci harboring these genes show increased growth 
in human blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mouse models of meningitis and
pneumonia showed that pneumococcal strains without arginine biosynthesis genes
were attenuated in growth or cleared, from lung, blood and CSF. Thus, S.
pneumoniae arginine synthesis genes promote growth and virulence in invasive
pneumococcal disease.
