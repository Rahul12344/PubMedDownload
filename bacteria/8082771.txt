The 3'-CCA end of tRNA(Phe) from Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus was
changed to AAA, CCC, UUU and UUA by the stepwise degradation procedure of the
3'-CCA end of tRNA(Phe) followed by the ligation with oligoribonucleotides.
Substrate activity of tRNA(UUAPhe) and tRNA(CCCPhe) in tRNA aminoacylation was
shown. tRNA(AAAPhe) is a bad substrate for E. coli and Th. thermophilus
phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases. tRNA(UUUPhe) has no detectable activity in tRNA
aminoacylation. Therefore the nature of the 3'-end of tRNA(Phe) plays an
important role in tRNA binding and its substrate efficiency. Nevertheless the CCA
sequence at the 3'-end of tRNA(Phe) does not seem to be an absolute requirement
for tRNA aminoacylation.
