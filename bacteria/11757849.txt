Ion track filters (ITFs) are produced by physiochemical treatments to thin films 
of polymers and mica irradiated by heavy ions. These ITFs have many applications 
in the fields of science and technology. In the present investigation, the
developed ITFs from polycarbonate films have been used to filter bacteria of
various types in water. It is observed that the electric conduction through these
filters depends upon the concentration of contaminants and pore diameter of
filters. Filtration experiments were carried out using both single and multipore 
filters. Other applications related to environment surveillance have also been
reported.
