The aim of our study was to monitor the effects of dietary synbiotics on
experimentally infected mice. Sixty mice were divided into the following three
groups: negative control group C1, positive control group C2 (mice infected with 
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O149:F4NAL), and experimental group LF
(Lactobacillus reuteri CCM 8617RIF + 10% flaxseed + E. coli O149:F4NAL).
Supplements were administered for 42 days. Microbiological, hematological, and
biochemical analyses, electrophoretic analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
isoenzymes, and analysis of fatty acids using gas chromatography and
isotachophoresis were performed. We recorded higher numbers of jejunal and ileal 
lactic acid bacteria, lower Enterobacteriaceae counts in the feces of the
animals, and an increased production of organic acids in the synbiotic-fed group.
The supplements applied favored n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism 
and inhibited n-6 PUFA metabolism; thus, they influenced the n-6 to n-3 and
eicosapentaenoic to arachidonic acid ratios. Additionally, the incorporation of
n-3 PUFAs to the cell membrane decreased the activity of LDH, transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase. Results obtained in our study indicate the positive effect 
of continuous supplementation of combination of probiotic cheese enriched with L.
reuteri CCM 8617RIF and crushed flaxseed on composition of intestinal microflora 
and alleviation of the course of infection induced by pathogenic bacterium E.
coli O149:F4NAL.
