The thin layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) contains antimicrobial substances
that kill the small numbers of bacteria that are constantly being deposited in
the lungs. An increase in ASL salt concentration inhibits the activity of airway 
antimicrobial factors and may partially explain the pathogenesis of cystic
fibrosis (CF). We tested the hypothesis that an osmolyte with a low
transepithelial permeability may lower the ASL salt concentration, thereby
enhancing innate immunity. We found that the five-carbon sugar xylitol has a low 
transepithelial permeability, is poorly metabolized by several bacteria, and can 
lower the ASL salt concentration in both CF and non-CF airway epithelia in vitro.
Furthermore, in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, xylitol sprayed for 
4 days into each nostril of normal volunteers significantly decreased the number 
of nasal coagulase-negative Staphylococcus compared with saline control. Xylitol 
may be of value in decreasing ASL salt concentration and enhancing the innate
antimicrobial defense at the airway surface.
