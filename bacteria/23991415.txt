PURPOSE: To investigate differences in the biological features of the most
immunoexpressed prostate cancer (PC) profiles (PSA+, PSMA+) according to the
RKIP.
METHODS: 19 PC with dominant Gleason grade ≥ 8 were studied. Expression of PSA,
PSMA, RKIP, Raf-1, MEK-1, ERK-1, ERK-2, p-Akt (T308), p-Akt (S473), NF- κ B p50, 
and NF- κ Bp65 were detected immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: . Loss of RKIP in the most immunoexpressed PC (PSA+, PSMA+) profile was 
associated with increased levels of PSA and PSMA expression. Intensities of
immunoreactions to PSA and PSMA were higher in cancer cells negative for RKIP
(12.51 ± 1.6 and 34.95 ± 1.92) compared to those positive for RKIP (4.68 ± 1.11
and 28.56 ± 0.91). In parallel, missing RKIP expression in PC patients with PSA+,
PSMA+ profile was connected with increased components of both Raf-1/MEK/ERK and
NF- κ B (p65/p50), whereas Akt is activated independently of RKIP.
CONCLUSIONS: Although characterized by the same (PSA+, PSMA+) profile, PC
phenotype missing the RKIP related to invasive potential and greater biological
aggressiveness reflected in overexpression of components of Raf-1/MEK/ERK and NF-
κ B (p65/p50) in which Akt is activated independently of RKIP. Taking into
account the PC phenotypes according to RKIP among PSA-PSMA profiles may improve
distinguishing them from cancers that will become more aggressive and therefore
adapt the therapeutic strategies in those patients.
