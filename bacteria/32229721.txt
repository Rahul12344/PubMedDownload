Immune microenvironment plays a critical role in lung cancer control versus
progression and metastasis. In this investigation, we explored the effect of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulations on lung cancer biology by studying
in vitro cocultures, in vivo mouse models, and human lung cancer tissue.
Lymphocyte conditioned media (CM) induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and migration in both primary human lung cancer cells and cell lines.
Correspondingly, major accumulation of Th9 and Th17 cells was detected in human
lung cancer tissue and correlated with poor survival. Coculturing lung cancer
cells with Th9/Th17 cells or exposing them to the respective CM induced EMT in
cancer cells and modulated the expression profile of genes implicated in EMT and 
metastasis. These features were reproduced by the signatory cytokines IL-9 and
IL-17, with gene regulatory profiles evoked by these cytokines partly overlapping
and partly complementary. Coinjection of Th9/Th17 cells with tumor cells in WT,
Rag1-/-, Il9r-/-, and Il17ra-/- mice altered tumor growth and metastasis.
Accordingly, inhibition of IL-9 or IL-17 cytokines by neutralizing antibodies
decreased EMT and slowed lung cancer progression and metastasis. In conclusion,
Th9 and Th17 lymphocytes induce lung cancer cell EMT, thereby promoting migration
and metastatic spreading and offering potentially novel therapeutic strategies.
