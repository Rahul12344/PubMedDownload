The present study is an evaluation of changes undergone in the serum of factors
C3 and C4 of the complement, IgG, IgA, IgM and circulating immune complexes
during the initial phase of sepsis and throughout its development in 53 patients,
with the object of establishing their prognostic value. During the initial phase 
of sepsis the determination of the serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA,
IgM), C3 and C4 complement components and circulating immune complexes lack
prognostic interest. Nevertheless, the disappearance of circulating immune
complexes, together with an intensive reduction in concentration of IgG, IgM, and
C3 and C4 complement components below the range of normality, during the
evolutive course, is an indication of a bad prognosis.
