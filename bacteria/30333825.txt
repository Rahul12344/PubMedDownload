The spatiotemporal regulation of immune responses in the lymph node (LN) depends 
on its sophisticated tissue architecture, consisting of several subcompartments
supported by distinct fibroblastic stromal cells (FSCs). However, the intricate
details of stromal structures and associated FSC subsets are not fully
understood. Using several gene reporter mice, we sought to discover unrecognized 
stromal structures and FSCs in the LN. The four previously identified FSC subsets
in the cortex are clearly distinguished by the expression pattern of reporters
including PDGFRÎ², CCL21-ser, and CXCL12. Herein, we identified a unique FSC
subset expressing both CCL21-ser and CXCL12 in the deep cortex periphery (DCP)
that is characterized by preferential B cell localization. This subset was
clearly different from CXCL12highLepRhigh FSCs in the medullary cord, which
harbors plasma cells. B cell localization in the DCP was controlled chiefly by
CCL21-ser and, to a lesser extent, CXCL12. Moreover, the optimal development of
the DCP as well as medulla requires B cells. Together, our findings suggest the
presence of a unique microenvironment in the cortex-medulla boundary and offer an
advanced view of the multi-layered stromal framework constructed by distinct FSC 
subsets in the LN.
