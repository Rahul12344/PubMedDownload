Alternative lengthening of telomeres, or ALT, is a recombination-based process
that maintains telomeres to render some cancer cells immortal. The prevailing
view is that ALT is inhibited by heterochromatin because heterochromatin prevents
recombination. To test this model, we used telomere-specific quantitative
proteomics on cells with heterochromatin deficiencies. In contrast to
expectations, we found that ALT does not result from a lack of heterochromatin;
rather, ALT is a consequence of heterochromatin formation at telomeres, which is 
seeded by the histone methyltransferase SETDB1. Heterochromatin stimulates
transcriptional elongation at telomeres together with the recruitment of
recombination factors, while disrupting heterochromatin had the opposite effect. 
Consistently, loss of SETDB1, disrupts telomeric heterochromatin and abrogates
ALT. Thus, inhibiting telomeric heterochromatin formation in ALT cells might
offer a new therapeutic approach to cancer treatment.
