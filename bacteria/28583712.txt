Seven new bismuth(III) complexes derived from indole-carboxylic acids have been
synthesised: five are homoleptic; [Bi(IAA)3] B1, [Bi(IPA)3] B2, [Bi(IBA)3] B3,
[Bi(MICA)3] B4, [Bi(IGA)3] B6, and two are heteroleptic [BiPh(MICA)2] B5 (where
IAA-H=2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetic acid, IPA-H=3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid,
IBA-H=4-(1H-indol-3-yl)butanoic acid, IGA-H=2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid,
and MICA-H=1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylic acid). All complexes were fully
characterised by elemental analysis, infrared and mass-spectroscopy, and nuclear 
magnetic resonance (1H, 13C) spectroscopy. Complex [BiPh(IGA)2] B7 is
structurally authenticated by X-ray crystallography as a dimer in the
solid-state. The in-vitro anti-bacterial activity of the indole-carboxylic acids 
and their bismuth(III) complexes was assessed against Helicobacter pylori. While 
the acids were non-toxic at <100μgmL-1, all the bismuth compounds showed an MIC
of 6.25μgmL-1, indicating that the anti-bacterial activity is insensitive to the 
degree of substitution at the Bi(III) centre or the composition of the
indole-carboxylate ligands. All compounds were further tested for their
anti-parasitic activity against Leishmania major and for their toxicity towards
mammalian cells. From the anti-parasitic studies, it was found that the
heteroleptic bismuth(III) complexes are the most active, with B5 and B7 showing
comparable activity to Amphotericin B, without any toxicity towards the mammalian
cells at their effective concentration.
