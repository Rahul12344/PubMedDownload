Murine embryonal carcinoma F9 cells, a tissue culture model for early embryonic
development, do not produce interferon (IFN) in response to poly(I-C), as
determined by an antiviral assay. RNase protection analyses were used to examine 
total RNA extracted from the cells for the presence of beta-IFN RNA. Whereas F9
cells differentiated in vitro with retinoic acid produced a biologically active
protein as well as beta-IFN RNA in response to poly(I-C), undifferentiated F9
cells produced no detectable beta-IFN RNA even in the presence of cycloheximide, 
an IFN-superinducing agent. These results show that undifferentiated embryonal
carcinoma cells do not accumulate beta-IFN RNA in response to an IFN-inducing
agent, suggesting a transcriptional regulatory mechanism. However, this control
mechanism is altered upon differentiation, since the gene can be
transcriptionally activated in retinoic acid-differentiated cells.
