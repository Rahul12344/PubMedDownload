BACKGROUND: Novobiocin is a coumarin antibiotic, which affects also eukaryotic
cells inhibiting activity of Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). The Hsp90 represents 
a molecular chaperone critical for stabilization and activation of many proteins,
particularly oncoproteins that drive cancer progression. Currently, Hsp90
inhibitors focus a significant attention since they form a potentially new class 
of drugs in therapy of cancer. However, in the process of tumorigenesis a
significant role is played also by the microenvironment of the tumour, and, in
particular, by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This study aimed at
examination of the effect played by novobiocin on viability of human gingival
fibroblasts (HGF-1).
METHODS: The studies were conducted using 24 h cultures of human gingival
fibroblasts - HGF-1 (CRL-2014) in Chamber Slides, in presence of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0,
2.5 or 5.0 mM novobiocin. Cell viability was evaluated using fluorescence test,
ATP assay and LDH release.
RESULTS: Viability of HGF-1 was drastically reduced after 5 hour treatment with
novobiocin in concentrations of 1 mM or higher. In turn, the percentage of
LDH-releasing cells after 5 h did not differ from control value although it
significantly increased after 10 h incubation with 1 mM and continued to increase
till the 20th hour.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data indicate that novobiocin may induce death of human
gingival fibroblasts. Therefore, application of the Hsp90 inhibitor in neoplastic
therapy seems controversial: on one hand novobiocin reduces tumour-associated
CAFs but, on the other, it may induce a significant destruction of periodontium.
