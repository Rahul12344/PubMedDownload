Cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) is a conserved virulence factor in
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Here we report the presence and functionality 
of cdtB in some nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars, including Salmonella
Javiana (cdtB+wt S. Javiana), isolated from imported food. To understand the role
of cdtB in NTS serovars, a deletion mutant (cdtB(-)ΔS. Javiana) was constructed. 
Macrophages were infected with cdtB+wt S. Javiana (wild type), cdtB(-)Δ S.
Javiana (mutant), and cdtB-negative NTS serovar (S. Typhimurium). Cytotoxic
activity and transcription level of genes involved in cell death (apoptosis,
autophagy, and necrosis) were assessed in infected macrophages. The cdtB+wt S.
Javiana caused cellular distension as well as high degree of vacuolization and
presence of the autophagosome marker LC3 in infected macrophages as compared with
cdtB(-)ΔS. Javiana. The mRNA expression of genes involved in the induction of
autophagy in response to toxin (Esr1 and Pik3C3) and coregulators of autophagy
and apoptosis (Bax and Cyld) were significantly upregulated in cdtB(+)wt S.
Javiana-infected macrophages. As autophagy destroys internalized pathogens in
addition to the infected cell, it may reduce the spread of infection.
