Immune reagents for the detection of specific antigen-binding lymphocytes (ABL)
with respect to different Salmonells antigens were developed. Rabbits were
immunized with killed S. typhi and other salmonellae containing cross-reacting
antigens, and the dynamics of the formation of ASL of each specificity was
studied. Differences in the time of the appearance of ASL with receptors to
thymus-independent (09, 12 or Vi) and thymus-dependent (Hd) antigens were
studied. The relative content of ASL, determined with the use of immune reagents 
prepared from S. typhi antigens, was higher, on the whole, in rabbits immunized
with S. typhi than in rabbits immunized with salmonellae containing one of
cross-reacting antigens (S. enteritidis--09, 12; S. paratyphi C--Vi; S.
virginia--Hd).
