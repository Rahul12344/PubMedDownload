The development of IL-4-producing effector T cells during a type 2 immune
response requires signaling through B7 ligands, but probably not CD40 ligands.
Here, William Gause and colleagues review the still controversial role of CD28
and CTLA-4 on T cells, and B7-1 and B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells, and provide
a model to incorporate recent findings.
