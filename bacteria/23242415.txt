CD4(+)CXCR5(+)Foxp3(+) follicular regulatory T cells (T(FR) cells) inhibit
humoral immunity mediated by CD4(+)CXCR5(+)Foxp3(-) follicular helper T cells
(T(FH) cells). Although the inhibitory receptor PD-1 is expressed by both cell
types, its role in the differentiation of T(FR) cells is unknown. Here we found
that mice deficient in PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 had a greater abundance of T(FR)
cells in the lymph nodes and that those T(FR) cells had enhanced suppressive
ability. We also found substantial populations of T(FR) cells in mouse blood and 
demonstrated that T(FR) cells in the blood homed to lymph nodes and potently
inhibited T(FH) cells in vivo. T(FR) cells in the blood required signaling via
the costimulatory receptors CD28 and ICOS but were inhibited by PD-1 and PD-L1.
Our findings demonstrate mechanisms by which the PD-1 pathway regulates antibody 
production and help reconcile inconsistencies surrounding the role of this
pathway in humoral immunity.
