Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is an emerging tickborne infection
resulting in an acute febrile illness associated with cytopenias and
characteristic intracellular organisms within peripheral blood granulocytes. The 
etiologic agent of HGE has recently been isolated and cultivated in the HL-60
promyelocytic leukemia cell line, but the spectrum of host cells that it
naturally infects remains unknown. To determine if normal hematopoietic
progenitors could be targets of infection, CD34+ primary human bone marrow cells,
stimulated to differentiate along myelomonocytic lineages, were incubated with
the HGE agent. Immature marrow progenitors and, remarkably, not only granulocytic
but also CD14+ monocytic cells from these cultures supported replication of the
HGE agent, suggesting that all are potential targets of infection in vivo.
Infection of bone marrow progenitors may contribute to the hematologic
manifestations of HGE. Furthermore, the ability of the agent to interact with
monocytes has significant implications regarding disease pathogenesis and host
response.
