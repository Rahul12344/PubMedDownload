The interaction between mycobacteria and epithelium is unexplored, but may
determine the outcome of the infection. We have analyzed the role of two G
protein-coupled receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 that are important regulators of many 
pulmonary diseases. We found that mycobacteria significantly increased the
expression of both CXCR1 and CXCR2 on alveolar epithelial cells and both
receptors were found to be important for neutrophil diapedesis across primary
endothelial cells towards infected mucosa. Mycobacteria, lipoarabinomannan or
19-kDa glycolipoprotein up-regulated the inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor
kinase (GRK)2, while GRK3 was less affected. Mycobacteria-induced GRK2
up-regulation decreased chemokine transcription and secretion thereby affecting
the neutrophil recruitment to infected mucosa. These events were completely
abolished by blocking these receptors prior to infection as the blocking
increased epithelial immune responses. We have identified novel interactions
occurring in the initial phase of mycobacterial infections by which mycobacterial
manipulate epithelial inflammatory responses.
