The number and function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are sensitive to
hyperglycemia, hypertension, and smoking in humans, which are also associated
with the development of atherosclerosis. GroEL1 from Chlamydia pneumoniae has
been found in atherosclerotic lesions and is related to atherosclerotic
pathogenesis. However, the actual effects of GroEL1 on EPC function are unclear. 
In this study, we investigate the EPC function in GroEL1-administered hind
limb-ischemic C57BL/B6 and C57BL/10ScNJ (a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mutation) 
mice and human EPCs. In mice, laser Doppler imaging, flow cytometry, and
immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the degree of neo-vasculogenesis,
circulating level of EPCs, and expression of CD34, vWF, and endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS) in vessels. Blood flow in the ischemic limb was
significantly impaired in C57BL/B6 but not C57BL/10ScNJ mice treated with GroEL1.
Circulating EPCs were also decreased after GroEL1 administration in C57BL/B6
mice. Additionally, GroEL1 inhibited the expression of CD34 and eNOS in C57BL/B6 
ischemic muscle. In vitro, GroEL1 impaired the capacity of differentiation,
mobilization, tube formation, and migration of EPCs. GroEL1 increased senescence,
which was mediated by caspases, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2 signaling in EPCs.
Furthermore, GroEL1 decreased integrin and E-selectin expression and induced
inflammatory responses in EPCs. In conclusion, these findings suggest that TLR4
and impaired NO-related mechanisms could contribute to the reduced number and
functional activity of EPCs in the presence of GroEL1 from C. pneumoniae.
