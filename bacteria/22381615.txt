Mass fish mortalities have been reported in the past decade from British waters, 
often coinciding with blooms of filamentous actinobacteria, particularly strains 
of Streptomyces griseus. The present study has shown that some fractions of the
exudate of S. griseus, prepared after a series of high pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) separations, and analysed with liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry (LC-MS), induced pathological changes to the gills of carp and/or
tench fry following exposure under laboratory conditions up to 96 h Similar
changes were induced by streptomycin, a secondary metabolite of S. griseus, and
these included loss of microridging and fusion of secondary lamellae, with carp
fry in the case of the exudate of S. griseus being more sensitive than tench fry,
especially with exposure to fraction 9 and selected sub-fractions of 9. Some
deformities using a severity index were also observed in the head capsule of
larvae of the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius, including loss and splitting 
of teeth on the mentum. The results are discussed in relation to further
identification of metabolites derived from samples of the organic filtrate of S. 
griseus and implications for the functioning of freshwater ecosystems.
