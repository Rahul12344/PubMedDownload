BACKGROUND/AIMS: Leukodystrophies due to abnormal production of myelin cause
extensive morbidity in early life; their genetic background is still largely
unknown. We aimed at reaching a molecular diagnosis in Ashkenazi-Jewish patients 
who suffered from developmental regression at 6-13â€…months, leukodystrophy and
peripheral neuropathy.
METHODS: Exome analysis, determination of alkaline ceramidase activity catalysing
the conversion of C18:1-ceramide to sphingosine and
D-ribo-C12-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) (NBD)-phytoceramide to
NBD-C12-fatty acid using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) and thin layer chromatography, respectively, and sphingolipid analysis
in patients' blood by LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: The patients were homozygous for p.E33G in the ACER3, which encodes a
C18:1-alkaline ceramidase and C20:1-alkaline ceramidase. The mutation abolished
ACER3 catalytic activity in the patients' cells and failed to restore alkaline
ceramidase activity in yeast mutant strain. The levels of ACER3 substrates,
C18:1-ceramides and dihydroceramides and C20:1-ceramides and dihydroceramides and
other long-chain ceramides and dihydroceramides were markedly increased in the
patients' plasma, along with that of complex sphingolipids, including
monohexosylceramides and lactosylceramides.
CONCLUSIONS: Homozygosity for the p.E33G mutation in the ACER3 gene results in
inactivation of ACER3, leading to the accumulation of various sphingolipids in
blood and probably in brain, likely accounting for this new form of childhood
leukodystrophy.
