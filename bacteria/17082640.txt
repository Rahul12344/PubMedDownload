Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen found in urinary tract infections
(UTIs), mainly affecting children and women. We report that CD44, a hyaluronic
acid (HA) binding protein that mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions,
facilitates the interaction of E. coli with urothelial cells and thus the
infection of the host. We found that CD44 is constitutively expressed on
urothelial cells and that HA accumulates in E. coli-induced UTI. In
CD44-deficient mice, the bacterial outgrowth was dramatically less compared with 
wild-type mice despite similar granulocyte influx in the bladder and in the
kidney as well as comparable cytokines/chemokines levels in both genotypes. E.
coli was able to bind HA, which adhered to CD44-positive tubular epithelial
cells. Most importantly, the interaction of CD44 on tubular epithelial cells with
HA facilitated the migration of E. coli through the epithelial monolayer. The
results provide evidence that CD44 on urothelial cells facilitates E. coli UTI.
Disruption of the interaction between CD44 and HA in the bladder may provide a
new approach to prevent and to treat UTI.
