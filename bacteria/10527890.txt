Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are outer cell wall components of
gram-negative bacteria that may cause septic shock in mammals. The exact
morphology of LPS when interacting with macromolecular complexes of the septic
shock pathway in blood is still uncertain. Here, the geometry and morphology of
hydrated bacterial LPS, dispersed in solution, at and below its the critical
aggregate concentration, were directly examined by tapping mode atomic force
microscopy (TMAFM) and dynamic light scattering. High-resolution phase-shift
TMAFM images of hydrated LPS of Salmonella minnesota Re595, Salmonella
typhimurium, and Escherichia coli 0111:B4 adsorbed on mica surfaces unveiled
nanosized lipidic particles with a species-specific organization. The complex
hydrodynamic geometry exhibited by LPS in dilute suspensions may have
consequences for the interpretation of LPS biological activity in the host immune
response.
