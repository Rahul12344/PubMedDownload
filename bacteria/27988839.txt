Stroke induces a catastrophic immune response that involves the global activation
of peripheral leukocytes, especially T cells. The human leukocyte antigen-DRα1
domain linked to MOG-35-55 peptide (DRα1-MOG-35-55) is a partial major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II construct which can inhibit
neuroantigen-specific T cells and block binding of the cytokine/chemokine
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to its CD74 receptor on monocytes
and macrophages. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of DRα1-MOG-35-55 in a
mouse model of permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO).
DRα1-MOG-35-55 was administered to WT C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous injection
starting 4 h after the onset of ischemia followed by three daily injections. We
demonstrated that DRα1-MOG-35-55 post treatment significantly reduced brain
infarct volume, improved functional outcomes, and inhibited the accumulation of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the
ischemic brain 96 h after dMCAO. In addition, DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment shifted
microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain to a beneficial M2 phenotype without 
changing their total numbers in the brain or blood. This study demonstrates for
the first time the therapeutic efficacy of the DRα1-MOG-35-55 construct in dMCAO 
across MHC class II barriers in C57BL/6 mice. This MHC-independent effect
obviates the need for tissue typing and will thus greatly expedite treatment with
DRα1-MOG-35-55 in human stroke subjects. Taken together, our findings suggest
that DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment may reduce ischemic brain injury by regulating
post-stroke immune responses in the brain and the periphery.
