OBJECTIVE: The 9_2 carbohydrate-binding module (C2) locates natively at the
C-terminus of the GH10 thermophilic xylanase from Thermotoga marimita. When fused
to the C-terminus, C2 improved thermostability of a GH11 xylanase (Xyn) from
Aspergillus niger. However, a question is whether the C-terminal C2 would have a 
thermostabilizing effect when fused to the N-terminus of a catalytic module.
RESULTS: A chimeric enzyme, C2-Xyn, was created by step-extension PCR, cloned in 
pET21a(+), and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The C2-Xyn exhibited a 2 °C higher
optimal temperature, a 2.8-fold longer thermostability, and a 4.5-fold higher
catalytic efficiency on beechwood xylan than the Xyn. The C2-Xyn exhibited a
similar affinity for binding to beechwood xylan and a higher affinity for
oat-spelt xylan than Xyn.
CONCLUSION: C2 is a thermostabilizing carbohydrate-binding module and provides a 
model of fusion at an enzymatic terminus inconsistent with the modular natural
terminal location.
