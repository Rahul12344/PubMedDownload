The effects of the addition of different strains of lactic acid bacteria on
different quality parameters of a Brazilian goat semi-hard cheese (coalho) were
assessed during 7 days of storage (10°C) as follows: Control, Lactobacillus
lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris (standard); C2, L.
acidophilus; C3, L. paracasei; C4, Bifidobacterium lactis; and C5, L.
acidophilus, L. paracasei and B. lactis. There were no differences for the
proteolysis index and depth of proteolysis among the assessed cheeses. The
cheeses presented increase in hardness, gumminess and chewiness during the
storage. Regarding the ability to melt, all evaluated cheeses showed a reduction 
in diameter. Cheeses presented high luminosity with predominance of the yellow
component; and number of lactic bacteria greater than 10⁶-10⁷ cfu/g during the 7 
days of storage. C5 had better sensory scores in the acceptance test, purchase
intention and preference ranking test. Coalho goat cheese could be a potential
carrier of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
