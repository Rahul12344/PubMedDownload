Autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis predominantly affect females.
Although high levels of sex hormones, particularly estrogen (E2), can reduce
proinflammatory immune responses, it remains unclear if a lack of endogenous sex 
hormones might affect treatment with exogenous sex hormones. Pretreatment with E2
almost completely prevents intact female and male mice from developing clinical
and histological signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by
promoting various regulatory immune cell phenotypes. To evaluate the effects of
exogenous estrogen in the absence of endogenous sex hormones, the current study
compared EAE severity and the emergence of different immunoregulatory cell
populations after E2 pretreatment of ovariectomized (OVX) female versus male
mice. We found that E2 equally protected both OVX females and males from EAE over
a 21Â day observation period concomitant with reduced total cell numbers in spleen
and spinal cord (males only), but enhanced percentages of CD19+CD5+CD1dhi,
CD19+CD138+CD44hi and CD19+Tim-1+ Breg cells, CD8+CD122+ Treg cells and CD11b+CD 
206+ARG-1+ anti-inflammatory M2-like monocytes/macrophages in both groups. In
contrast, E2 decreased the percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells in OVX
females but increased these Treg cells in males and intact female mice. These
data suggest that with the exception of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells, E2 protection
against EAE promotes highly overlapping immunoregulatory subsets in OVX females
and males.
