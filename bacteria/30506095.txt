PURPOSE: Donor-to-host transmission of infectious agents is a rare but
well-recognised complication of corneal transplantation and may carry a grave
visual prognosis. In this case series, we describe the clinical features and risk
factors of using culture-positive donor corneas for transplantation.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of a series of patients who underwent either 
penetrating keratoplasty (PK) or Descemet's stripping automated endothelial
keratoplasty (DSAEK) with positive microbiology cultivation during routine
assessment of donor corneal tissue obtained at the time of surgery. Donor and
recipient characteristics, tissue preparation and surgical parameters, clinical
signs and outcomes were registered.
RESULTS: Eleven patients who received culture-positive corneal grafts were
identified: six with Candida, three with Gram-positive bacteria and two with
Gram-negative bacteria. Three patients developed clinical keratitis after routine
DSAEK using corneas contaminated with Candida species. The median
death-to-preservation time (DPT) of these three donor corneas was 18.08 (range
18.08 to 20.90) h, while in the remaining eight donors, it was 12.27 (range 9.32 
to 20.47) h. Despite the initiation of antifungal treatment, all three cases
required explantation of the graft and a subsequent re-DSAEK.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of donor corneas that are culture-positive for Candida
carries a risk for developing postoperative keratitis and the risk may be higher 
in DSAEK. Unlike the cold storage technique employed for donor corneas described 
in this case series, organ culture technique requires microbiological screening
and supplementation of an antifungal agent which may reduce the risk of
donor-to-host transmission of fungal infection.
