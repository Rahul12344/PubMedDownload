This study highlights the importance of determining substrate specificity at
variable experimental conditions. Lipases and esterases were isolated from
microorganisms cultivated from Eucalyptus wood species and then concentrated
(cellulases removed) and characterized. Phenol red agar plates supplemented with 
1% olive oil or tributyrin was ascertained to be the most favourable method of
screening for lipolytic activity. Lipolytic activity of the various enzymes were 
highest at 45-61 U/ml at the optimum temperature and pH of between at 30-35 °C
and pH 4-5, respectively. Change in pH influenced the substrate specificity of
the enzymes tested. The majority of enzymes tested displayed a propensity for
longer aliphatic acyl chains such as dodecanoate (C12), myristate (C14),
palmitate (C16) and stearate (C18) indicating that they could be characterised as
potential lipases. Prospective esterases were also detected with specificity
towards acetate (C2), butyrate (C4) and valerate (C5). Enzymes maintained up to
95% activity at the optimal pH and temperature for 2-3 h. It is essential to test
substrates at various pH and temperature when determining optimum activity of
lipolytic enzymes, a method rarely employed. The stability of the enzymes at
acidic pH and moderate temperatures makes them excellent candidates for
application in the treatment of pitch during acid bi-sulphite pulping, which
would greatly benefit the pulp and paper industry.
