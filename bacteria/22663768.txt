Memory and naive CD4 T cells have unique regulatory pathways for self/non-self
discrimination. A memory cell specific regulatory pathway was revealed using
superantigens to trigger the TCR. Upon stimulation by bacterial superantigens,
like staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), TCR proximal signaling is impaired
leading to clonal tolerance (anergy). In the present report, we show that memory 
cell anergy results from the sequestration of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 
away from the TCR/CD3ζ chain. During SEB-induced signaling, ZAP-70 is excluded
from both detergent-resistant membrane microdomains and the immunological
synapse, thus blocking downstream signaling. We also show that the mechanism
underlying memory cell anergy must involve Fyn kinase, given that the suppression
of Fyn activity restores the movement of ZAP-70 to the immunological synapse, TCR
proximal signaling, and cell proliferation. Thus, toleragens, including microbial
toxins, may modulate memory responses by targeting the organizational structure
of memory cell signaling complexes.
