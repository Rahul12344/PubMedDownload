Two unusual, Gram-negative, catalase- and oxidase-positive rods, designated C2(T)
and C5, were isolated from compost samples. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
studies demonstrated that both isolates were members of the genus Pseudomonas and
belonged to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa group. Strain C2(T) was most closely
related to Pseudomonas cuatrocienegasensis 1N(T) and Pseudomonas borbori
R-20821(T) (97.9 and 97.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively).
However, phylogenetic analysis based on rpoD gene sequences revealed that both
isolates could be discriminated from members of the P. aeruginosa group that
exhibited >97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The DNA G+C content of strain
C2(T) was 61.5 mol%. The major fatty acids of strain C2(T) were a summed feature 
(C(16:1)ω7c and/or iso-C(15:0) 2-OH), C(18:1)ω7c/12t/9t, C(16:0) and C(12:0),
which supported the isolates' affiliation with the genus Pseudomonas. Moreover,
strain C2(T) could be distinguished from its closest phylogenetic neighbours of
the genus Pseudomonas by DNA-DNA hybridization studies and biochemical tests. On 
the basis of both phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, it is proposed that the
isolates be classified as a novel species, with the name Pseudomonas composti sp.
nov. The type strain is C2(T) (=CECT 7516(T)=CCUG 59231(T)).
