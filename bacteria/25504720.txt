Iron sequestration provides an innate defense, termed nutritional immunity,
leading pathogens to scavenge iron from hosts. Although the molecular basis of
this battle for iron is established, its potential as a force for evolution at
host-pathogen interfaces is unknown. We show that the iron transport protein
transferrin is engaged in ancient and ongoing evolutionary conflicts with TbpA, a
transferrin surface receptor from bacteria. Single substitutions in transferrin
at rapidly evolving sites reverse TbpA binding, providing a mechanism to
counteract bacterial iron piracy among great apes. Furthermore, the C2
transferrin polymorphism in humans evades TbpA variants from Haemophilus
influenzae, revealing a functional basis for standing genetic variation. These
findings identify a central role for nutritional immunity in the persistent
evolutionary conflicts between primates and bacterial pathogens.
