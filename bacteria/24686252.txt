Cannabicyclohexanol (CP-47,497-C8) is a representative of a group of
cannabimimetic cyclohexylphenols which is added to herbal mixtures as a cannabis 
substitute since 2008. Although in the beginning CP-47,497-C8 was the main
ingredient of "Spice" and similar products, it was partly replaced by
aminoalkylindole-type cannabinoid receptor agonists like JWH-018, JWH-073 or
JWH-250, but never completely disappeared from the market. Since information on
its toxicological properties is scarce, we investigated the effects of the drug
in human derived cell lines. The cytotoxic effects were studied in a panel of
assays (SRB, XTT, LDHe and NR tests) in a buccal derived (TR146) and a liver
derived (HepG2) cell line. The strongest effects were seen in the two former
assays at levels ≥ 7.5 μM indicating that the compound interferes with protein
synthesis and causes membrane damage. In additional comet assays, DNA damage was 
detected at levels ≥10 μM. Experiments with lesion specific enzymes showed that
these effects are not due to oxidative damage of DNA bases. The negative findings
obtained in Salmonella/microsome assays and the positive results of micronucleus 
tests with the cell lines indicate that the compound does not cause gene
mutations but acts on the chromosomal level. In contrast to other synthetic
cannabinoids, no indication for estrogenic/antiestrogenic properties was seen in 
a luciferase assay with bone marrow derived U2-OS cells. In conclusion, our
findings show that the drug has only weak cytotoxic properties. However, the
induction of chromosomal damage indicates that it may cause adverse effects in
users due to its impact on the stability of the genetic material.
