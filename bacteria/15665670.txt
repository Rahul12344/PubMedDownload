PURPOSE: Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) and cathelicidin LL-37 are salt-sensitive 
cationic antimicrobial peptides expressed by ocular surface epithelia. The goal
of this study was to investigate the effect of preservative-free artificial tears
on hBD-2 and LL-37 antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
METHODS: P. aeruginosa was incubated with hBD-2 or LL-37 in the absence or
presence (70% vol/vol) of different preservative-free artificial tears--Visine
Tears (300 mOsm/kg), Tears Naturale Free (261 mOsm/kg), TheraTears (185 mOsm/kg),
and Refresh Plus (325 mOsm/kg)--for 2 hours at 37 degrees C. In some experiments,
P. aeruginosa was incubated with hBD-2 or LL-37 and Visine Tears or Tears
Naturale Free with or without carboxymethylcellulose (0.5% vol/vol final
concentration). Plates were inoculated with samples of each reaction mixture and 
then incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C.
RESULTS: Visine Tears and Tears Naturale Free had little or no effect on the
antimicrobial activity of 100 microg/mL hBD-2 or LL-37. In the presence of
Refresh Plus and TheraTears, the activity of 100 microg/mL hBD-2 or LL-37 was
reduced by 90% to 100%. Carboxymethylcellulose, at a concentration comparable to 
that present in Refresh Plus, reduced the effectiveness of hBD-2 or LL-37 by 40% 
to 90% in the presence of Tears Naturale Free and Visine Tears.
CONCLUSION: Human beta-defensin-2 and cathelicidin LL-37 inhibit the growth of P.
aeruginosa in vitro, but this activity is markedly reduced in the presence of
Refresh Plus and TheraTears. These results suggest that
carboxymethylcellulose-containing artificial tears may reduce the activity of the
endogenously produced antimicrobial peptides.
