The membrane attack complex (MAC)/perforin-like protein complement component 9
(C9) is the major component of the MAC, a multi-protein complex that forms pores 
in the membrane of target pathogens. In contrast to homologous proteins such as
perforin and the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), all of which require
the membrane for oligomerisation, C9 assembles directly onto the nascent MAC from
solution. However, the molecular mechanism of MAC assembly remains to be
understood. Here we present the 8 Å cryo-EM structure of a soluble form of the
poly-C9 component of the MAC. These data reveal a 22-fold symmetrical arrangement
of C9 molecules that yield an 88-strand pore-forming β-barrel. The N-terminal
thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) domain forms an unexpectedly extensive part of the
oligomerisation interface, thus likely facilitating solution-based assembly.
These TSP1 interactions may also explain how additional C9 subunits can be
recruited to the growing MAC subsequent to membrane insertion.
