OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and relationship of p27(kip1) and its
related molecules Jab1 and CRM1 during proliferation of lymphoma cells U937.
METHODS: U937 cells were treated with serum starvation and release, and the
effects of these treatments on the cell growth was tested with cell number
counting. The expression and localization of p27(kip1), Jab1 and CRM1 in U937
cells were detected by Western blot, double immunolabelling and laser scanning
confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: The growth of U937 cells was blocked by serum starvation. The total
protein of p27(kip1) was increased while Ser10-phosphorylated p27(kip1) -related 
molecules Jab1 and CRM1 were decreased. Meanwhile, the location of p27(kip1) was 
changed from cytoplasm into nuclei. After serum release, the location of
p27(kip1) expression reappeared in the cytoplasm again.
CONCLUSION: During the proliferation process of lymphoma U937 cells, Jab1 and
CRM1 may influence the location and expression of p27kip1, and may participate in
regulation of growth of NHL cells.
