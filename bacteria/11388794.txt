The development of recombinant techniques for rapid cloning, expression, and
characterization of cDNAs encoding antibody (Ab) subunits has revolutionized the 
field of antibody engineering. By fusion to heterologous protein domains, chain
shuffling, or inclusion of self-assembly motifs, novel molecules such as
bispecific Abs can be generated that possess the subset of functional properties 
designed to fit the intended application. We describe the engineering of Ab
fragments produced in bacteria for blocking the CD28-CD80/CD86 costimulatory
interaction in order to induce tolerance against transplanted organs. We designed
single-chain Fv antibodies, monospecific and bispecific diabodies, and a
bispecific tetravalent antibody (BiTAb) molecule directed against the CD80 and/or
CD86 costimulatory molecules. These recombinant Ab molecules were expressed in
Escherichia coli, followed by purification and evaluation for specific
interaction with their respective antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). A specific sandwich ELISA confirmed the bispecificity of the bispecific 
diabodies and the BiTAb.
