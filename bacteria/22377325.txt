We evaluated the 2G-NN16-carbosilane dendrimer activities in Th17 response as a
potential therapy for Th17 deregulated pathologies. IL17A, IL17F, IL22, IL23 and 
other interleukins secreted by Th17 cells CD4+ cells were down regulated when
cells were cultured in the presence of this dendrimer. Furthermore, IL17F and
IL17A protein levels in splenocytes from mice pretreated with 2G-NN16 dendrimer
in a Th17 induction mouse model were lower than those corresponding to PBS
treated mice. Treatment of mice with 2G-NN16 inhibited the Th17 response causing 
much more pathogenicity as indicated by the increase in the number of Candida
albicans colonies in the kidneys as compared to PBS-treated mice. All these
results suggest a potential pharmacological application for this dendrimer in the
therapy of Th17-mediated diseases.
