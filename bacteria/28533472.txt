Pathogenic yersiniae harbor a type III secretion system (T3SS) that injects
Yersinia outer protein (Yop) into host cells. YopK has been shown to control Yop 
translocation and prevent inflammasome recognition of the T3SS by the innate
immune system. Here, we demonstrate that YopK inhibits bacterial adherence to
host cells by binding to the extracellular matrix adaptor protein matrilin-2
(MATN2). YopK binds to MATN2, and deleting amino acids 91 to 124 disrupts binding
of YopK to MATN2. A yopK null mutant exhibits a hyperadhesive phenotype, which
could be responsible for the established Yop hypertranslocation phenotype of yopK
mutants. Expression of YopK, but not YopKΔ91-124, in a yopK mutant restored the
wild-type phenotypes of adhesion and Yop translocation, suggesting that binding
to MATN2 might be essential for YopK to inhibit bacterial adhesion and negatively
regulate Yop translocation. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-YopK fusion
specifically binds to the endogenous MATN2 on the surface of HeLa cells, whereas 
GFP-YopKΔ91-124 cannot. Addition of purified YopK protein during infection
decreased adhesion of Y. pestis to HeLa cells, while YopKΔ91-124 protein showed
no effect. Taking these results together, we propose a model that the
T3SS-secreted YopK hinders bacterial adhesion to HeLa cells by binding to MATN2, 
which is ubiquitously exposed on eukaryotic cells.
