One hundred ovine milk samples were subjected to bacteriological analysis to
detect staphylococci. Twenty-four staphylococcal strains isolated were
characterised for methicillin resistance with disk diffusion test (DDT) after
incubation at 24 and 48 h, oxacillin agar screen test, Minimal Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC), nitrocefin test for beta-lactamase production and PCR for
the mecA gene. Nine staphylococcal strains resulted resistant in DDT; some
differences in the halo diameter at double incubation period were noted; eight of
these strains were resistant in MIC test; just one strain was positive to
oxacillin agar screen test. All strains were mecA negative by PCR and positive by
nitrocefin test. On the basis of these results methicillin-resistant strains can 
be classified as beta-lactamase hyperproducers.
