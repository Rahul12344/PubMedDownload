Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are intracellular organisms that reside in
phagosomes of alveolar macrophages (AMs). To determine the in vivo role of AM
depletion in host defense against M. tuberculosis infection, mice with pulmonary 
tuberculosis induced by intranasal administration of virulent M. tuberculosis
were treated intranasally with either liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene
diphosphonate (AM(-) mice), liposomes, or saline (AM(+) mice). AM(-) mice were
completely protected against lethality, which was associated with a reduced
outgrowth of mycobacteria in lungs and liver, and a polarized production of type 
1 cytokines in lung tissue, and by splenocytes stimulated ex vivo. AM(-) mice
displayed deficient granuloma formation, but were more capable of attraction and 
activation of T cells into the lung and had increased numbers of pulmonary
polymorphonuclear cells. These data demonstrate that depletion of AMs is
protective during pulmonary tuberculosis.
