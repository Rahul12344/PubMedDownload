A proof-of-concept study is reported for the differentiation between
microcolonies of Enterobacter sakazakii and Klebsiella pneumoniae by means of a
novel sample preparation for infrared (IR) analysis. A disposable,
IR-transparent, microporous (0.2-microm pores), hydrophobic, polyethylene (PE)
membrane (51 microm thick) was plasma treated under an oxygen atmosphere and used
to (i) filter (or print microarrays of) dilute aqueous foodborne bacterial
suspensions and (ii) subsequently grow bacterial microcolonies when the treated, 
hydrophilic PE membrane was placed over brain heart infusion agar medium and
incubated. Because this unique membrane is transparent to IR light, isolated
microcolonies (200 microm) of bacterial cells grown on this PE substrate for the 
first time could be directly fingerprinted by IR microspectroscopy in the
transmission mode. Hence, time-consuming bacterial cell transfer from culture
plates to an IR sample holder for subsequent measurement by IR spectroscopy was
eliminated. Multivariate analysis of the observed IR spectra for microcolonies
allowed the rapid differentiation between E. sakazakii and K. pneumoniae.
