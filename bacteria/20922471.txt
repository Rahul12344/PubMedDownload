ECTO-NOX proteins are growth-related cell surface proteins that catalyze both
hydroquinone or NADH oxidation and protein disulfide interchange and exhibit
time-keeping and prion-like properties. A bacterially expressed truncated
recombinant 46 kDa ENOX2 with full ENOX2 activity bound ca 2 moles copper and 2
moles of zinc per mole of protein. Unfolding of the protein in trifluoroacetic
acid in the presence of the copper chelator bathocuproine resulted in reversible 
loss of both enzymatic activities and of a characteristic pattern in the Amide I 
to Amide II ratios determined by FTIR with restoration by added copper. The
H546-V-H together with His 562 form one copper binding site and H582 represents a
second copper site as determined from site-directed mutagenesis. Bound copper
emerges as having an essential role in ENOX2 both for enzymatic activity and for 
the structural changes that underly the periodic alternations in activity that
define the time-keeping cycle of the protein.
