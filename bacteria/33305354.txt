Pneumonia represents a major health care burden and Gram-negative bacteria
provide an increasing therapeutic challenge at least in part through the
emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. IL-33 is a multifunctional cytokine
belonging to the IL-1 family that can affect many different cell types. We sought
here to determine the effect of recombinant IL-33 on the host response during
murine pneumonia caused by the common Gram-negative pathogen Klebsiella
pneumoniae. IL-33 pretreatment prolonged survival for more than 1 day during
lethal airway infection and decreased bacterial loads at the primary site of
infection and distant organs. Postponed treatment with IL-33 (3 h) also reduced
bacterial growth and dissemination. IL-33-mediated protection was not observed in
mice deficient for the IL-33 receptor component IL-1 receptor-like 1. IL-33
induced a brisk type 2 response, characterized by recruitment of type 2 innate
lymphoid cells to the lungs and enhanced release of IL-5 and IL-13. However,
neither absence of innate lymphoid cells or IL-13, nor blocking of IL-5 impacted 
on IL-33 effects in mice infected with Klebsiella. Likewise, IL-33 remained
effective in reducing bacterial loads in mice lacking B, T, and natural killer T 
cells. Experiments using antibody-mediated cell depletion indicated that
neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were of importance for antibacterial
defense. The capacity of IL-33 to restrict bacterial growth in the lungs was
strongly reduced in mice depleted of both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes,
but not in mice selectively depleted of either one of these cell types. These
results suggest that IL-33 boosts host defense during bacterial pneumonia by a
combined effect on neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. © 2020 The Authors.
