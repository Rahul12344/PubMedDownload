Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the main therapeutic approaches for patients
with malignant tumours, especially advanced tumours. However, they can cause
adverse effects, one of which is gastrointestinal mucosal damage, which can
greatly affect patients' quality of life. Until now, there have been no effective
therapies to avoid or treat these adverse effects. In this study, we used
attenuated Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) to deliver the hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) or keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to murine
gastrointestinal mucosa. We found that attenuated S. typhimurium carrying the HGF
or KGF genes can effectively reduce the ratio of tumour to non-tumour carcass
weight, repair damage to the gastrointestinal mucosal from chemotherapy, improve 
the immune response, and reduce the mortality rate of mice. Oral administration
of attenuated S. typhimurium with HGF and KGF may be promising as a way of
improving the quality of life of patients undergoing radiotherapy and
chemotherapy.
