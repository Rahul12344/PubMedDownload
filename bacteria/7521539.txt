As normal cells progress toward malignancy, they must switch to an angiogenic
phenotype to attract the nourishing vasculature that they depend on for their
growth. In cultured fibroblasts from Li-Fraumeni patients, this switch was found 
to coincide with loss of the wild-type allele of the p53 tumor suppressor gene
and to be the result of reduced expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent 
inhibitor of angiogenesis. Transfection assays revealed that p53 can stimulate
the endogenous TSP-1 gene and positively regulate TSP-1 promoter sequences. These
data indicate that, in fibroblasts, wild-type p53 inhibits angiogenesis through
regulation of TSP-1 synthesis.
