Benthic communities in the aquatic ecosystem are influenced by both natural and
anthropogenic stressors. To understand the ecogenomic responses of sediment
communities to the multiple stressors of polluted environments, the bacteria,
protistan and metazoan communities in sediments from marine and adjacent riverine
areas of North Bohai Sea were characterized by environmental DNA
meta-systematics, and their associations with environmental variables were
assessed by multiple statistical approaches. The bacterial communities were
dominated by Firmicutes (mean 22.4%), Proteobacteria (mean 21.6%) and
Actinobacteria (mean 21.5%). The protistan communities were dominated by
Ochrophyta (33.7%), Cercozoa (18.9%) and Ciliophora (17.9%). Arthropoda (71.1%)
dominated the metazoan communities in sediments. The structures of communities in
sediments were shaped by both natural variables (spatial variability and/or
salinity (presented as Na and Ca)) and anthropogenic contaminants, including
DDTs, PAHs or metals (Cu, Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni and Zn).
Particularly, the correlation network of multiple communities was modulated by
the concentrations of Na and DDTs at the family level. Overall, environmental DNA
meta-systematics can provide a powerful tool for biomonitoring, sediment quality 
assessment, and key stressors identification.
