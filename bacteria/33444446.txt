Alkylating drugs are among the most often used chemotherapeutics. While cancer
cells frequently develop resistance to alkylation treatments, detailed
understanding of mechanisms that lead to the resistance is limited. Here, by
using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 based screen, we identify transcriptional Mediator 
complex subunit 13 (MED13) as a novel modulator of alkylation response. The
alkylation exposure causes significant MED13 downregulation, while complete loss 
of MED13 results in reduced apoptosis and resistance to alkylating agents.
Transcriptome analysis identified cyclin D1 (CCND1) as one of the highly
overexpressed genes in MED13 knock-out (KO) cells, characterized by shorter G1
phase. MED13 is able to bind to CCND1 regulatory elements thus influencing the
expression. The resistance of MED13 KO cells is directly dependent on the cyclin 
D1 overexpression, and its down-regulation is sufficient to re-sensitize the
cells to alkylating agents. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of
MED13-mediated response, by applying combinatory treatment with CDK8/19 inhibitor
Senexin A. Importantly, the treatment with Senexin A stabilizes MED13, and in
combination with alkylating agents significantly reduces viability of cancer
cells. In summary, our findings identify novel alkylation stress response
mechanism dependent on MED13 and cyclin D1 that can serve as basis for
development of innovative therapeutic strategies.
