BACKGROUND: A recently developed prediction score based on age, arterial oxygen
partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) and plateau
pressure (abbreviated as 'APPS') was shown to accurately predict mortality in
patients diagnosed with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). After
thorough temporal external validation of the APPS, we tested the spatial external
validity in a cohort of ARDS patients recruited during 3 years in two hospitals
in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with moderate or severe ARDS according to the
Berlin definition were included in this observational multicenter cohort study
from the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of two university hospitals. The APPS was
calculated per patient with the maximal airway pressure instead of the plateau
pressure as all patients were ventilated in pressure-controlled mode. The
predictive accuracy for hospital mortality was evaluated by calculating the area 
under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC). Additionally, the
score was recalibrated and reassessed.
RESULTS: In total, 439 patients with moderate or severe ARDS were analyzed.
All-cause hospital mortality was 43 %. The APPS predicted all-cause hospital
mortality with moderate accuracy, with an AUC-ROC of 0.62 [95 % confidence
interval (CI) 0.56-0.67]. Calibration was moderate using the original cutoff
values (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit P < 0.001), and recalibration was
performed for the cutoff value for age and plateau pressure. This resulted in
good calibration (P = 1.0), but predictive accuracy did not improve (AUC-ROC
0.63, 95 % CI 0.58-0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy for all-cause hospital mortality of the APPS
was moderate, also after recalibration of the score, and thus the APPS does not
seem to be fitted for that purpose. The APPS might serve as simple tool for
stratification of mortality in patients with moderate or severe ARDS. Without
recalibrations, the performance of the APPS was moderate and we should therefore 
hesitate to blindly apply the score to other cohorts of ARDS patients.
