OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the use of lymphocyte subset counts as
diagnostic and prognostic markers for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
(CRE) infection.
METHODS: We assessed the lymphocyte subset populations and other clinical
parameters of septic patients upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and
evaluated their potential impact on CRE infection diagnosis and outcome.
RESULTS: Among 373 septic patients, 51 were diagnosed with CRE infection. The
28-day mortality was significantly higher in CRE than non-CRE patients (35.3% vs 
14.9%). The T lymphocyte count and CD4+CD28+ T cell count were both independent
risk factors for CRE infection, with the latter had the best diagnostic ability
(AUC: 0.908; p < 0.0001). Lower CD4+CD28+ T cell counts were associated with
higher likelihoods of CRE infection. The CRE incidence and 28-day mortality of
CRE-infected patients could be predicted using cutoff values of 242 (sensitivity:
83.9%; specificity: 87.5%) and 58.5 (sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 61.1%)
CD4+CD28+ T cells/μl at ICU admission, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Septic patients with CRE infection had higher 28-day mortality.
Given that the CD4+CD28+ T cell count was significantly lower in CRE than non-CRE
septic patients and a lower cell count was significantly associated with higher
28-day mortality, CD4+CD28+ T cell counts may be useful markers for early
diagnosis of CRE infection and outcome prediction.
