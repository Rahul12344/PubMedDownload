BACKGROUND: Formation of intraperitoneal adhesions is one of the major
complications after abdominal surgery, which may lead to bowel obstruction.
Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is an extracellular matrix modulating glycoprotein
during tissue regeneration and collagen deposition.
AIM: To evaluated the therapeutic potential of overexpressed TSP-1 in suppressing
pelvic adhesion formations in rat models.
METHODS: Pelvic adhesion was induced in anesthetized rats by laparotomy cecal
abrasion. The animals were randomly assigned to treatment of local application
with Seprafilm (an antiadhesive bioresorbable membrane) or adenoviral vectors
encoding mouse TSP-1 (AdTSP-1) on the surfaces of the injured cecum. The severity
of the peritoneal adhesions was evaluated by blinded observers 14 d later.
RESULTS: Compared with control (no treatment) group, the application of Sperafilm
significantly reduced the formation of adhesion band, and local administration of
AdTSP-1 on the injured cecum the also attenuated the severity of peritoneal
adhesion score. However, systemic delivery of AdTSP-1 did not affect the
formation of adhesion.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that therapeutic approaches in inducing regional
overexpression of TSP-1 may serve as alternative treatment strategies for
preventing postoperative peritoneal adhesion.
