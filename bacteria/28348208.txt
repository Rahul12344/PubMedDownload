To establish infections, Salmonella injects virulence effectors that hijack the
host actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide signaling to drive pathogen
invasion. How effectors reprogram the cytoskeleton network remains unclear. By
reconstituting the activities of the Salmonella effector SopE, we recapitulated
Rho GTPase-driven actin polymerization at model phospholipid membrane bilayers in
cell-free extracts and identified the network of Rho-recruited cytoskeleton
proteins. Knockdown of network components revealed a key role for myosin VI
(MYO6) in Salmonella invasion. SopE triggered MYO6 localization to invasion foci,
and SopE-mediated activation of PAK recruited MYO6 to actin-rich membranes. We
show that the virulence effector SopB requires MYO6 to regulate the localization 
of PIP3 and PI(3)P phosphoinositides and Akt activation. SopE and SopB target
MYO6 to coordinate phosphoinositide production at invasion foci, facilitating the
recruitment of cytoskeleton adaptor proteins to mediate pathogen uptake.
