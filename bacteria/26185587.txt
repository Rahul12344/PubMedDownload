INTRODUCTION: In preparation for Mass Drug Administration by National Lymphatic
Filariasis Elimination Programme, a baseline epidemiological investigation on
lymphatic filariasis (LF) was conducted in two sentinel sites of Ogun State,
Nigeria. The study was carried out in Ado-Odo Ota and Abeokuta South Local
Government Areas (LGAs) to determine LF prevalence, microfilarial density and the
abundance of Wucheraria bancrofti in the mosquito vectors.
METHODS: Microscopic examination of thick blood smears of 299 and 288
participants from Ado-Odo Ota and Abeokuta South LGAs was conducted. Visual
observations of clinical manifestations of chronic infection and questionnaire
administration were also conducted. Indoor resting mosquitoes were collected
using the pyrethrum spray technique and CDC light traps and mosquitoes were
dissected for filarial larvae.
RESULTS: Microfilaria prevalences were 4.0% and 2.4% in Ado-odo Ota and Abeokuta 
South LGAs. The microflarial density (mfd) was 30.6mf/ml and 23.9 mf/ml in the
same areas. No clinical manifestations of the infection were found at both sites.
Knowledge of LF by inhabitants was very low in the two areas. Anopheles gambiae
s.l and Culex species mosquitoes were collected but none was found positive for
stage L3 infective larvae.
CONCLUSION: Mass awareness campaigns on the goal of mass drug administration,
cause of LF, mode of transmission, the relationship between infection and
clinical signs/symptoms is advocated so as to increase acceptance and support of 
the control programme by the community.
