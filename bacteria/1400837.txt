The gene of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) of a thermophilic bacterium
Bacillus stearothermophilus was expressed in Escherichia coli, and SHMT was
successfully purified from the crude extract of E. coli in two steps while
maintaining the enzymatic activity. The purification steps involved ammonium
sulphate precipitation followed by high-performance liquid chromatographic
separation using the anion-exchange column Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(S). In addition
to the DEAE column, three other types of anion- and cation-exchange columns were 
also studied for their ability to separate SHMT, and the performance of the four 
columns were compared.
