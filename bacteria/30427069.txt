Natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize glycolipids presented on CD1d. They share 
features of adaptive T lymphocytes and innate NK cells, and mediate
immunoregulatory functions via rapid production of cytokines. Invariant (iNKT)
and diverse (dNKT) NKT cell subsets are defined by their TCR. The immunological
role of dNKT cells, that do not express the invariant TCRα-chain used by iNKT
cells, is less well explored than that of iNKT cells. Here, we investigated
signals driving Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand activation of TCR-transgenic
murine dNKT cells. IFN-γ production by dNKT cells required dendritic cells (DC), 
cell-to-cell contact and presence of TLR ligands. TLR-stimulated DC activated
dNKT cells to secrete IFN-γ in a CD1d-, CD80/86- and type I IFN-independent
manner. In contrast, a requirement for IL-12p40, and a TLR ligand-selective
dependence on IL-18 or IL-15 was observed. TLR ligand/DC stimulation provoked
early secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by both CD62L+ and CD62L- dNKT
cells. However, proliferation was limited. In contrast, TCR/co-receptor-mediated 
activation resulted in proliferation and delayed production of a broader cytokine
spectrum preferentially in CD62L- dNKT cells. Thus, innate (TLR ligand/DC) and
adaptive (TCR/co-receptor) stimulation of dNKT cells resulted in distinct
cellular responses that may contribute differently to the formation of immune
memory.
