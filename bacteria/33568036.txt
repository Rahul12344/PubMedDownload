BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci is responsible
for hospital and community-acquired infections.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the antibiotic-resistance patterns,
antibiotic-resistance genes, namely, ermA, ermB, ermC, blaZ, msrA, tetK, tetM,
mup, and vanA, biofilm formation, and prevalence of different SCCmec types among 
the Staphylococcus cohniistrains isolated from clinical samples in Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: In this study,S. cohniiisolates were screened from the clinical samples 
from March 2012 to February 2013 in Tehran, Iran.Antimicrobial susceptibility
test and inducible clindamycin resistance were evaluated by disc diffusion
method, andresistance genes were examined using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
assays. Then, biofilm formation assay was analyzed by Microtiter-plate test to
detect the icaA and icaDgenes. The SCCmec and the Arginine Catabolite Mobile
Element (ACME) typing were performed using the PCRmethod.
RESULTS: FromtwentyS. cohnii, all isolates were resistant to cefoxitin. 95% of
the S. cohnii was defined as multidrug resistance (MDR)strains. The ermB, ermC,
and vanA genes were not detected in any isolates; however, the blaZ gene had the 
highest frequency.95% of the S. cohnii isolates produced biofilm. Also, 4 SCCmec 
types, including V, IV, III+ (C2), VIII+ (AB1), were identified. Therefore, the
majority of SCCmec were untypable. Based on the ACME typing, arcA and opp3 genes 
were positive in 13 (65%) and 1 (5%) isolates, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Due to the high antimicrobial resistance and the spread of
untypableSCCmecamong the isolates studied, the control and treatment of
methicillin-resistantS. cohnii in hospitals and public health centers is a
significant concern.
