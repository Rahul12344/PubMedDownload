We discovered an inverting maltose phosphorylase (Bsel2056) belonging to
glycoside hydrolase family 65 from Bacillus selenitireducens MLS10, which
possesses synthetic ability for α-D-glucosyl disaccharides and trisaccharides
through the reverse phosphorolysis with β-D-glucose 1-phosphate as the donor.
Bsel2056 showed the flexibility for monosaccharide acceptors with alternative C2 
substituent (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-deoxy-D-arabino-hexose,
2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose, D-mannose), resulting in production of
1,4-α-D-glucosyl disaccharides with strict regioselectivity. In addition,
Bsel2056 synthesized two maltose derivatives possessing additional D-glucosyl
residue bound to C2 position of the D-glucose residue at the reducing end,
1,4-α-D-glucopyranosyl-[1,2-α-D-glucopyranosyl]-D-glucose and
1,4-α-D-glucopyranosyl-[1,2-β-D-glucopyranosyl]-D-glucose, from
1,2-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucose (kojibiose) and 1,2-β-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucose
(sophorose), respectively, as the acceptors. These results suggested that
Bsel2056 possessed a binding space to accommodate the bulky C2 substituent of
D-glucose.
