The Authors describe an epidemiological survey performed after a cluster of cases
of foodborne infection involving several participants at a wedding reception. The
aim was to identify the food, the responsible pathogen and any shortcomings in
the coordination between the various services and the territorial operating units
involved in the outbreak investigation. The investigation involved 149
participants; fifty seven persons (38.3%) had a foodborne illness. The only food 
item that remained associated with illness after multiple regression analysis was
the ricotta cheese (RR 3.58, I.C. 1.,72-7.48 ). The finding of B. cereus in
samples of ricotta cheese collected at the dairy food supplier indicate its
responsibility for the outbreak but diagnostic certainty could not be achieved as
no leftovers were available. Thus, shortcomings in this epidemiological
investigation are constituted by: delayed notification, which prevented the
acquisition of food samples, lack of a reference laboratory and lack of a
specific diagnostic protocols, which prevented the microbiological research for
the rapid identification of new pathogens incriminated in foodborne diseases.
Finally, environmental and sanitary inspections showed deficiencies in the
hygienic measures of food storage, particularly regarding refrigeration and in
the HACCP plan that was not properly implemented.
