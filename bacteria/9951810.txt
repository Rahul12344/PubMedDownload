The HLA-A, -B, -DR and -DQ antigen distribution in 20 unrelated Thai patients
with Takayasu's arteritis was compared with that in 44 healthy controls. The
frequency of HLA-A31 and HLA-B52 (chi2=4.54, P<0.05; chi2=3.80, P<0.05, RR=7.5)
appeared to be increased in the patient group. In contrast, the frequency of
HLA-A24 and HLA-DQ3 (chi2=4.18, P<0.05, RR=0.25; chi2=5.36, P<.025, RR=0.28)
appeared to be decreased in this group.
