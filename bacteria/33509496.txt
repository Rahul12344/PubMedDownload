Volatiles and microbiome from different Xiang xi sausages (HBD, HBN, HHY and HDK)
were performed by Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry and Illumina MiSeq
platform (16 S rRNA and ITS sequencing). Results indicated that ethanol, ethyl
acetate, ethyl-propanoate, pinene, limonene, cineole, etc. were the key (main)
volatiles; whereas staphylococcus, lactobacillus, solanum-torvum, brochothrix and
debaryomyces, candida were the dominant bacteria and fungi, respectively. The
variation and relationship between microbiome and volatiles were disclosed by
multivariate and spearman's correlation analysis. Volatiles of HDK is similar to 
HBN and HBD compared to HHY, while microbiome community of HHY is similar to HBN 
and HDK compared to HBD. Solanum-torvum, pseudomonas (bacteria) and debaryomyces 
(fungi) contributed positively to the development of major volatiles in Xiangxi
sausages. Meanwhile, 'carbohydrate metabolism', 'amino acid metabolism'
(microbia) and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (volatiles) were commented in KEGG
database. This study provides a deep insight into the relation between volatiles 
and microbiome (bacteria and fungi) of Xiangxi sausages.
