Biotransformation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) by
Alcaligenes eutrophus A5 was demonstrated by analysis of ethyl acetate-extracted 
products from resting cell cultures. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
characterization of the neutral extracts revealed two hydroxy-DDT intermediates
(m/z = 370) with retention times at 19.55 and 19.80 min that shared identical
mass spectra. This result suggested that the hydroxylations occurred at the ortho
and meta positions on the aromatic ring. UV-visible spectrum spectrophotometric
analysis of a yellow metabolite in the culture supernatant showed a maximum A402 
with, under acidic and basic conditions, spectrophotometric characteristics
similar to those of the aromatic ring meta-cleavage products. 4-Chlorobenzoic
acid was detected by thin-layer chromatography radiochemical scanning in samples 
from mineralization experiments by comparison of Rf values of [14C]DDT
intermediates with that of an authentic standard. These results were further
confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This study indicates 
that DDT appears to be oxidized by a dioxygenase in A. eutrophus A5 and that the 
products of this oxidation are subsequently subjected to ring fission to
eventually yield 4-chlorobenzoic acid as a major stable intermediate.
