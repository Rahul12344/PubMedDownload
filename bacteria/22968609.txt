The main reason for halitosis is the enhanced evaporable amount of sulphur
compounds in the exhalation, which originates in the oral cavity due to local
protein fission. Oral bacteria hydrolyze proteins and further degrade amino
acids, which leads to halitosis. In an alkaline environment, many bacterial
species found in the oral cavity with their enzymes participate in the
degradation of proteins and formation of evaporable sulphur compounds. The
presence of bacteria in the oral cavity is associated with different chronic
inflammations in the soft tissues of the oral cavity. Mouth rinsing agents, which
contain essential oils, ensure the renewal of a normal microbiota in the oral
cavity, decreases the quantitative amount of bacteria and products released by
proteolytic bacteria. Bad breath was confirmed by measurements made by a portable
sulphide monitor or halimeter (Interscan Corporation, Model RH-17E USA). The
halimeter quantifies breath measurements in parts-per-billion (ppb) of sulphur
compounds. Halimeter measurements of patients showed increased levels of sulphur 
compounds. Oral mouthwashes containing essential oils possess a typical
antimicrobial activity, apparently, they do not form resistant microorganism
strains, and they do not cause allergic reactions.
