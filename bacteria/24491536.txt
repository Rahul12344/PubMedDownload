To characterize the luminescence properties of nanoKAZ, a 16 amino acid
substituted mutant of the catalytic 19kDa protein (KAZ) of Oplophorus luciferase,
the effects of each mutated amino acid were investigated by site-specific
mutagenesis. All 16 single substituted KAZ mutants were expressed in Escherichia 
coli cells and their secretory expressions in CHO-K1 cells were also examined
using the signal peptide sequence of Gaussia luciferase. Luminescence activity of
KAZ was significantly enhanced by single amino acid substitutions at V44I, A54I, 
or Y138I. Further, the triple mutant KAZ-V44I/A54I/Y138I, named eKAZ, was
prepared and these substitutions synergistically enhanced luminescence activity, 
showing 66-fold higher activity than wild-KAZ and also 7-fold higher activity
than nanoKAZ using coelenterazine as a substrate. Substrate specificity of eKAZ
for C2- and/or C6-modified coelenterazine analogues was different from that of
nanoKAZ, indicating that three amino acid substitutions may be responsible for
the substrate recognition of coelenterazine to increase luminescence activity. In
contrast, these substitutions did not stimulate protein secretion from CHO-K1
cells, suggesting that the folded-protein structure of KAZ might be different
from that of nanoKAZ.
