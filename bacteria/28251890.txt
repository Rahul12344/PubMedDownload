An outbreak of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis first identified in London has
now been ongoing for 20 years, making it the largest drug-resistant outbreak of
tuberculosis documented to date worldwide. We identified culture-confirmed cases 
with indistinguishable molecular strain types and extracted demographic,
clinical, microbiological and social risk factor data from surveillance systems. 
We summarised changes over time and used kernel-density estimation and k-function
analysis to assess geographic clustering. From 1995 to 2014, 508 cases were
reported, with a declining trend in recent years. Overall, 70% were male
(n = 360), 60% born in the United Kingdom (n = 306), 39% white (n = 199), and 26%
black Caribbean (n = 134). Median age increased from 25 years in the first 5
years to 42 in the last 5. Approximately two thirds of cases reported social risk
factors: 45% drug use (n = 227), 37% prison link (n = 189), 25% homelessness
(n = 125) and 13% alcohol dependence (n = 64). Treatment was completed at 12
months by 52% of cases (n = 206), and was significantly lower for those with
social risk factors (p < 0.05), but increased over time for all patients
(p < 0.05). The outbreak remained focused in north London throughout. Control of 
this outbreak requires continued efforts to prevent and treat further active
cases through targeted screening and enhanced case management.
