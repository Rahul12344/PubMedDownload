A Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain
wax(T), was isolated from DDT-contaminated soil in Yangzhou, China. Growth of
strain wax(T) was observed at 10-45°C (optimum 30°C) and pH 5.0-10.0 (optimum pH 
7.0-8.0). The predominant fatty acids were iso C(15:0) (32.21%) and anteiso
C(15:0) (22.2%). The strain contained large amounts of the polar lipids
diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol, but
small amounts of an unknown amino-group-containing polar lipid and phospholipids 
were also present. The major quinone was ubiquinone-8 (Q-8) and the G + C content
of the genomic DNA was 67.12 ± 0.8 mol.%. The phylogenetic tree shows that strain
wax(T) clustered within the genus Pseudoxanthomonas. Isolate wax(T) showed
moderate 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Pseudoxanthomonas broegbernensis 
B1616/1(T) (98.3%), P. suwonensis 4M1(T) (98.2%), P. daejeonensis TR6-08(T)
(98%), P. koreensis TR7-09(T) (97.7%), P. kaohsiungensis J36(T) (97.5%), P.
mexicana AMX 26B(T) (97.2%), and P. japonensis 12-3(T) (97%). The level of
DNA-DNA relatedness between strain wax(T) and Pseudoxanthomonas type strains were
low, e.g., P. koreensis TR7-09(T) (25.9%), P. broegbernensis B1616/1(T) (36.4%), 
P. suwonensis 4M1(T) (27.7%), P. daejeonensis TR6-08(T) (40%), P. kaohsiungensis 
J36(T) (20.4%), P. mexicana AMX 26B(T) (29.0%), P. japonensis 12-3(T) (33.3%). On
the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic data and molecular properties, strain
wax(T) represents a novel species within the genus Pseudoxanthomonas, for which
the name Pseudoxanthomonas jiangsuensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 
wax(T) (=DSM 22398(T) = CGMCC 1.10137(T)).
