BACKGROUND: Elective colon surgery has the highest rate of surgical site
infection (SSI) of any elective procedure in surgery. The evolution of strategies
for the prevention of SSI has had the correct use of preventive antibiotics as a 
crucial component.
METHODS: Review of the pertinent English-language literature.
RESULTS: Correct use of prophylactic antibiotics in elective colon surgery
requires that the drug have activity against colonic aerobic and anaerobic
bacteria, be administered immediately before the surgical incision, and not be
continued into the postoperative period. All of the documented and many of the
theoretically feasible antibiotic choices are discussed in terms of their
advantages for this indication.
CONCLUSIONS: The best outcomes in the prevention of SSI in elective colon surgery
are achieved when appropriate systemic antibiotics are employed in conjunction
with the appropriate use of oral antibiotic bowel preparation.
