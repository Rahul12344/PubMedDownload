The procedure of surface functionalization based on the use of
1-(3-Aminopropyl)silatrane (APS) instead of our early procedure utilizing
aminopropyl triethoxy silane (APTES) is described. Unlike APTES, APS is less
reactive and extremely resistant to hydrolysis and polymerization at neutral pH. 
The kinetics of DNA adsorption to APS-mica was studied. The results are
consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism suggesting that DNA molecules
bind irreversibly with the surface upon immobilization. This conclusion is
supported by the data on imaging of supercoiled DNA, the labile conformations of 
which are very sensitive to the conditions at the surface-liquid interface. In
addition, we demonstrated directly that the segments of DNA molecules could move 
along the surface if the sample is imaged in aqueous solution without drying of
the sample. Using the time-lapse mode of AFM imaging we visualized the transition
of purine-pyrimidine sequence in supercoiled DNA from intramolecular
triple-helical conformation (H-form) into the B-helix upon the change of pH from 
acidic (pH 5) to neutral. The mechanisms of the H-to-B transitions and the
correlation of the local structural transitions with a global DNA conformation
are discussed.
