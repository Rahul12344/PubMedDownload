BolA protein homologs are widely distributed in nature. In this report, we have
studied for the first time YrbA, the only BolA homolog present in Escherichia
coli, which we have renamed ibaG. We have constructed single and multiple ibaG
mutants, and overexpressed ibaG in wildtype strains, in order to characterize
this gene. The ibaG phenotypes are different from the bolA-associated round
morphologies or growth profiles. Interestingly, ibaG and bolA single- and
double-deletion mutants grow faster and have higher viabilities in rich media,
whereas the overexpressed strains are significantly growth impaired. However, the
mutant strains have lower viabilities than the wild type in the late stationary
phase, indicating that both bolA and ibaG are important for survival in difficult
growth conditions. bolA, as a transcription factor, binds to some promoters, but 
ibaG does not interact with the same DNA regions. We have determined that ibaG is
transcribed in an operon with the murA gene, involved in the synthesis of
peptidoglycan precursors. ibaG was also seen to change its mRNA expression
pattern in response to acidic stress. ibaG may thus represent a new gene involved
in cell resistance against acid stress.
