BACKGROUND: As dietary management during early childhood is a great barrier in
caries control, there is a need for the identification of intrinsic risk factors,
capable of allowing the use of a more cost-effective approach to early childhood 
caries (ECC).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the salivary peptide profile of children with and without 
ECC and its association with caries experience.
METHODS: One hundred and six 10- to 71-month-old children participated in the
study. Caries experience was determined through the visual/tactile method, based 
on the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth, and surface scores
(dmft/dmfs). Whole saliva was collected for mutans streptococci (MS) detection
and peptide analysis.
RESULTS: Chromatograms from CF (children without caries experience, n = 58) and
CE (children with caries experience, n = 48) saliva pools expressed different
patterns. Identification of molecular masses suggested the presence of nine
peptides. Three of them were significantly related with caries experience. HNP-3 
(α-defensin 3) (P = 0.019) and HBD-3 (β-defensin 3) (P = 0.034) reduced the
chances of experiencing ECC. Proline-rich peptides IB-4 significantly increased
caries experience (P = 0.035). Age (P = 0.020) and MS counts (P = 0.036)
increased caries experience; however, gender was not associated with dental
caries (P = 0.877).
CONCLUSION: Specific salivary peptides of CF or CE children in early childhood
predispose to a higher or lower risk of caries experience.
