Artemisinin (ART) has been shown to suppress B cell activation and plasma cell
formation. However, its effect on splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells is unknown. 
Splenic MZ B cells play a critical role in rapidly induced Ab production against 
blood-borne foreign Ags. Dysfunction of MZ B cells, due to inhibition of its
proliferation or displacement of its homing, results in an attenuated adaptive
humoral response. Here, we investigate the effect of ART on splenic MZ B (CD19+
CD21high CD23low ) and B10 (CD19+ CD1dhigh CD5+ ) B cells to explore the
mechanisms of ART-induced immunosuppression in T cell-deficient nude mice
challenged with hamster xenoantigens. In this study, we demonstrate that ART
decreases T cell-independent xenogeneic IgM Ab production and, this is associated
with a strong suppression of MZ B cell proliferation and a relative increase of
CD21low CD23+ follicular and B10 B cells. In addition, this suppression impairs
IL-10 production. Taken together, our data indicate that ART suppresses B cell
immune responses through a distinctive effect on splenic MZ B and other B cells. 
This represents a new mechanism of ART-induced immunosuppression.
