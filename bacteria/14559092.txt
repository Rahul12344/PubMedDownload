The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has had a major clinical impact. Clinical
research is now focused on the role of H. pylori and H. pylori eradication in the
treatment of several upper gastrointestinal disorders such as non-ulcer
dyspepsia, ulceration during therapy with aspirin or other anti-inflammatory
drugs, the treatment of precancerous conditions of the stomach, and the
prevention of gastric cancer. Triple and quadruple therapies have become the
standard for H. pylori eradication. The expansion of knowledge and the
development of new therapeutic modalities are likely to lead to a further
implementation of H. pylori-related methods in strategies for the prevention and 
treatment of upper gastrointestinal disorders.
