Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) comprise multiple regulatory
factors and play crucial roles in the maintenance of cellular integrity, while
unregulated activation of PML-NBs induces death and premature senescence. Hence, 
the function of PML-NBs must be directed properly; however, the mechanism that
regulates PML-NBs remains unclear. In this paper, we show that PML-NBs are
disintegrated by an AT-rich interaction domain family protein E2FBP1/hDril1
through specific desumoylation of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in vivo
and in vitro. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of E2FBP1/hDril1 results
in hyperplasis of PML-NBs and consequent commitment to PML-dependent premature
senescence. Thus, the function of E2FBP1/hDril1 is required for maintenance of
survival potential of the cells. Our data suggest a novel mechanism to govern
cellular integrity through the modulation of nuclear depots.
