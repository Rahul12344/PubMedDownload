Secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC) is a type of CC chemokine identified by
searching the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database. The full-length SLC gene was
synthesized based on human SLC sequence using SOE-PCR. The sequenced SLC gene was
cloned into expression vector pTMF and pALM, which used to transform Escherichia 
coli. Then the E. coli was cultured and induced according to protocol. The
expressed target protein was identified by Western blotting. The target protein
was expressed as soluble protein as well as inclusion bodies, the ratio of these 
two forms target protein varied with the difference conditions of culture and
induction. The target protein was purified with the methods of
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography. The results 
of electrophoresis of the purified target protein showed that the molecular
weight was larger than the predicted molecular weight.
