Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan represent
important targets for development of new antibacterial drugs. Among them, Mur
ligases (MurC to MurF) catalyze the formation of the final cytoplasmic precursor 
UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide from UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid. We present the
design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of phosphorylated
hydroxyethylamines as new type of small-molecule inhibitors of Mur ligases. We
show that the phosphate group attached to the hydroxyl moiety of the
hydroxyethylamine core is essential for good inhibitory activity. The IC(50)
values of these inhibitors were in the micromolar range, which makes them a
promising starting point for the development of multiple inhibitors of Mur
ligases as potential antibacterial agents. In addition,
1-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonamido)-3-morpholinopropan-2-yl dihydrogen phosphate 7a
was discovered as one of the best inhibitors of MurE described so far.
