The comparison of fitness between cells leads to the elimination of less
competent cells in the presence of more competent neighbors via cell competition 
(CC). This phenomenon has been linked with several cancer-related genes and thus 
may play an important role in cancer. Various processes are involved in the
regulation of tumor initiation and growth, including tumor hypoxia, clonal stem
cell selection, and immune cell response, all of which have been recently shown
to have a potential connection with the mechanisms involved in CC. This review
aims to unravel the relation between these processes and competitive cell
interactions and how this affects disease progression.
