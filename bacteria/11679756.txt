Arsenate reductase (AR) in B. subtilis is encoded by the chromosomal arsC gene.
Together with arsB and arsR, arsC participates in detoxification processes for
the arsenate and arsenite ions. Full-length arsenate reductase without any
modification has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in a soluble
form. The recombinant protein has been crystallized at 277 K using
polyethyleneglycol (PEG) or poly(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether (PME) as the main
precipitant. At least two forms of crystals large enough for data collection have
been obtained from wild-type protein under different conditions. An orthorhombic 
crystal diffracted to beyond 2.2 A with space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and unit-cell
parameters a = 51.22, b = 91.62, c = 101.93 A. A near-complete data set has been 
collected to 2.5 A. The application of the flash-annealing technique was crucial 
for high resolution during the data collection. The SeMet-substituted AR has also
been produced and crystallized under very similar conditions as the wild type,
but the unit-cell parameters are very different. The crystals of the SeMet
protein diffracted to higher resolution than those of the wild type.
