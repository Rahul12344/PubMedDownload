We present model calculations of the dynamics of primary electron transfer (ET)
in reaction centers of photosynthetic bacteria. We obtain half times of [unk]1 ps
and approximately 5 ps for the first two ET processes, in excellent agreement
with experimental observations. Our model is based on (i) a theoretical framework
capable of describing ET in the presence of strong electronic interstate
resonance coupling and (ii) energy parameters extracted from recent experimental 
data and molecular orbital calculations. Our analysis suggests that (i) strong
electronic interstate mixing is crucial to the rapidity and efficiency of
irreversible ET; (ii) possibly five rather than three electronic states
participate in the transient ET prior to the reduction in vivo of the quinone
complex; and (iii) conventional ET theories, which rely on weak electronic
interstate mixing, are unfit for describing ET in reaction centers of
photosynthetic bacteria.
