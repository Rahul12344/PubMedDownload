BACKGROUND: Enterococci, and especially multiresistant Enterococcus faecium, are 
increasingly found colonizing hospitalized patients. This increased prevalence of
colonization is not only associated with an increased prevalence of infections
caused by enterococci, but also by infections with other nosocomial pathogens. In
this study we investigated the causality of this observed relationship, by
determining the influence of intestinal colonization with E. faecium on pulmonary
defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three groups of mice were tested; 2 groups of
mice were pre-treated with vancomycin, of which one group was subsequently
treated by oral gavage of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE). The third group 
did not receive any pre-treatment. P. aeruginosa pneumonia was induced in all
mice. Vancomycin treatment resulted in intestinal gram-negative bacterial
overgrowth and VRE treatment resulted in colonization throughout the intestines. 
All 3 groups of mice were able to clear P. aeruginosa from the lungs and
circulation, with comparable lung cytokine responses and lung damage. Mice
treated with vancomycin without VRE colonization displayed modestly increased
plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10.
CONCLUSION: Overgrowth of E. faecium and/or gram-negative bacteria does not
impact importantly on pulmonary defense against P. aeruginosa pneumonia.
