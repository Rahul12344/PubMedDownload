The primary bile acids (BAs) are synthetized from colesterol in the liver,
conjugated to glycine or taurine to increase their solubility, secreted into
bile, concentrated in the gallbladder during fasting, and expelled in the
intestine in response to dietary fat, as well as bio-transformed in the colon to 
the secondary BAs by the gut microbiota, reabsorbed in the ileum and colon back
to the liver, and minimally lost in the feces. BAs in the intestine not only
regulate the digestion and absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and
fat-soluble vitamins, but also play a key role as signaling molecules in
modulating epithelial cell proliferation, gene expression, and lipid and glucose 
metabolism by activating farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G-protein-coupled bile
acid receptor-1 (GPBAR-1, also known as TGR5) in the liver, intestine, muscle and
brown adipose tissue. Recent studies have revealed the metabolic pathways of FXR 
and GPBAR-1 involved in the biosynthesis and enterohepatic circulation of BAs and
their functions as signaling molecules on lipid and glucose metabolism.
