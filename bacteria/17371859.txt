Sepsis is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response to invading
microorganisms. We describe the inflammatory mRNA profiles in whole-blood
leukocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes using a multigene system for 35
inflammatory markers that included pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, and signal transduction molecules in a case-control study with 34
patients with sepsis caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia
pseudomallei (the pathogen causing melioidosis) and 32 healthy volunteers.
Relative to healthy controls, patients with sepsis showed increased transcription
of a whole array of inflammatory genes in peripheral blood leukocytes,
granulocytes, and monocytes. Specific monocyte and granulocyte mRNA profiles were
identified. Strong correlations were found between inflammatory mRNA expression
levels in monocytes and clinical outcome. These data underline the notion that
circulating leukocytes are an important source for inflammatory mediators in
patients with gram-negative sepsis. Gene profiling such as was done here provides
an excellent tool to obtain insight into the extent of inflammation activation in
patients with severe infection.
