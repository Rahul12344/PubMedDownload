Two cases of suspected Lyme borreliosis in lambs are described. The clinical
signs observed resemble those described for Lyme borreliosis in dogs and horses. 
The lambs were approximately six months old and came from two different flocks in
a district heavily infested with Ixodes ricinus ticks. The lambs had pronounced
lameness in one leg, generally bad condition and poor appetite. They had high
serum levels of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi when tested in an ELISA.
The other lambs in the flocks were negative to B burgdorferi antibodies. Attempts
were made to isolate spirochaetes from one of the lambs, but were unsuccessful.
