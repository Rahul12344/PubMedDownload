An efficient immune response to tularemia is dependent on a strong cell-mediated 
component. We tried to identify markers of cellular immune responses that
indicate a vaccine efficacy against tularemia. BALB/c mice were immunized with
mutant F. tularensis 15∆23A and/or F. tularensis 15 NIIEG strains and then were
challenged i.n. with F. tularensis Schu. We compared the influence of F.
tularensis antigens (tularinum) in vitro on production of IL-1, IL-5, IL-6,
IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α by splenocytes obtained from intact mice and mice
immunized with mutant F. tularensis 15∆23A and/or F. tularensis 15 NIIEG strains.
We also compared expression of CD28, CD154, TLR-2, and CD69 markers on CD4 and
CD8 T-cells after activation with tularinum in vitro. We found that
tularinum-induced CD4(+) T-cells increased TNF-α and IFN-γ synthesis and
expression of CD69 only in group mice with high degree of post immunization
protection against F. tularensis Schu challenge. Estimation of CD69 expression on
CD3(+)CD4(+) cells and IFN-γ, TNF-α synthesis by CD4(+) T-lymphocytes could be
useful for determination protect ability of antitularemia immunity.
