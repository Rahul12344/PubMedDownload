Novel (4-(4-iodophenyl)-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazine derivatives were assayed for their
in vitro anti-Candida activity, compared to topical and systemic antifungal
drugs, against twenty-seven clinical isolates. The presence of aliphatic chains
or specific heteroaromatic rings on hydrazone moiety at position C2 and a
4-iodophenyl at C4 of the thiazole ring gave a promising inhibitory activity
especially against Candida albicans and Candida krusei. The most active compounds
have been also evaluated for their cytotoxicity and in association with
clotrimazole for anti-Candida activity.
