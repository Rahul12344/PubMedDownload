Human Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen(PSMA) cDNA was amplified using total RNA
extracted from prostate carcinoma tissue by RT-PCR. The cDNA fragment of
extracellular domain of PSMA(edPSMA) gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into
expression vector pMAL-c2x. Sequence analysis of both PSMA and edPSMA revealed
identity to the GenBank reported. The edPSMA was expressed in E. coli as part of 
a fusion protein with MBP as the induction of IPTG. Western blot analysis showed 
the recombinant protein could react with PSMA monocloned antibodies 4G5.
MBP-edPSMA fusion protein were purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography 
and showed to be homogeneity in SDS-PAGE(120 kD). BALB/C mice were immunized with
the purified protein for the preparation of polyclonal antibody. The polyclonal
antibody, which had a title of 1:12,800, were indicated the specificity to
prostate tissue.
