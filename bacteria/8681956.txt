The zeta polypeptide is part of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). The zeta-chain
contributes to efficient cell-surface expression of the TCR and accounts for part
of its signal transduction capability. TCR recognition triggers a complex set of 
events that result in cellular activation. The protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lck 
phosphorylates the zeta-chain, which in turn associates with another PTK, ZAP70, 
and stimulates its phosphorylation activity. Here we report the expression of the
intracellular part of the zeta-chain and its biochemical characterization. The
recombinant protein does not dimerize by itself in solution. Circular-dichroic
analysis reveals a random coil conformation. zeta, phosphorylated using
recombinant Lck, associates with recombinant ZAP70 tandem-SH2 domains. All three 
T cell activation motifs in zeta bind ZAP70 tandem-SH2 domains in vitro, forming 
a 1:3 complex. This result extends the picture, derived from earlier studies, of 
a mechanism for signal amplification.
