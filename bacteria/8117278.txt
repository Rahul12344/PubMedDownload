Nectadrin, the heat-stable antigen (HSA), is a highly glycosylated GPI-linked
glycoprotein that can undergo homophilic and heterophilic binding. In the present
work we have examined short-term effects of nectadrin antibodies on splenic B
lymphoblast aggregation and signal transduction. Monoclonal antibody 79 inhibited
cell aggregation and induced an intracellular Ca++ signal in the absence of
cross-linking. Both these effects were perturbed in the presence of LFA-1
antibodies. Nectadrin antibody M1/69 and polyclonal nectadrin antibodies
stimulated cell aggregation, did not induce a Ca++ signal, and their effects were
functionally independent of LFA-1. These results suggest that nectadrin may
concomitantly mediate primary and activate secondary adhesion mechanisms whereby 
each of these processes may be related to a different signal transduction
pathway.
