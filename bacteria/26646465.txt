OBJECTIVES: Visceral adipose tissue is a major site for expression of
proinflammatory and procoagulant genes during acute systemic inflammation. In
this study, we tested whether the loss of fat mass by dietary restriction would
remove the major source of these factors resulting in improved tolerance to
sepsis and endotoxemia.
DESIGN: Prospective, laboratory controlled experiments.
SETTING: Aging and critical care research laboratory in a university hospital.
SUBJECTS: Middle-aged (12-month old) male C57BL/6 mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Mice were subjected to 40% dietary restriction for 3 weeks
followed by induction of abdominal sepsis or endotoxemia by intraperitoneal
injection with cecal slurry or lipopolysaccharide, respectively.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with freely fed mice, dietary restricted 
mice exhibited dramatically improved survival (80% vs 0% after sepsis; p < 0.001 
and 86% vs 12% after endotoxemia; p = 0.013) and significantly reduced visceral
fat-derived messenger RNA expression of interleukin-6, thrombospondin-1,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue factor, which positively correlated
with fat mass. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 were significantly reduced by
dietary restriction and correlated with adipose interleukin-6 messenger RNA
levels and fat mass (p < 0.001; R = 0.64 and 0.89). In vitro culture of visceral 
fat explants from naive dietary restricted mice showed significantly reduced
interleukin-6 secretion compared with that from freely fed mice in response to
lipopolysaccharide. Analysis of major adipose immune cell populations by flow
cytometry demonstrated that macrophages were the only cell population reduced by 
dietary restriction and that CD11c/CD206 (M2-type) and CD11c/CD206 (double
negative) macrophages, in addition to T cells, are the major immune cell
populations that produce interleukin-6 in middle-aged mice during systemic
inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term dietary restriction drastically improved the survival
outcome of middle-aged mice during both polymicrobial sepsis and sterile
endotoxemia. Improved survival was accompanied by a significantly attenuated
inflammatory response in adipose tissue, which is likely due to alterations of
both fat mass quantity and qualitative changes, including a reduction in
macrophage populations.
