The SLC13 gene family is comprised of five sequence related proteins that are
found in animals, plants, yeast and bacteria. Proteins encoded by the SLC13 genes
are divided into the following two groups of transporters with distinct anion
specificities: the Na(+)-sulfate (NaS) cotransporters and the Na(+)-carboxylate
(NaC) cotransporters. Members of this gene family (in ascending order) are:
SLC13A1 (NaS1), SLC13A2 (NaC1), SLC13A3 (NaC3), SLC13A4 (NaS2) and SLC13A5
(NaC2). SLC13 proteins encode plasma membrane polypeptides with 8-13 putative
transmembrane domains, and are expressed in a variety of tissues. They are all
Na(+)-coupled symporters with strong cation preference for Na(+), and insensitive
to the stilbene 4, 4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS).
Their Na(+):anion coupling ratio is 3:1, indicative of electrogenic properties.
They have a substrate preference for divalent anions, which include
tetra-oxyanions for the NaS cotransporters or Krebs cycle intermediates
(including mono-, di- and tricarboxylates) for the NaC cotransporters. This
review will describe the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the
biochemical, physiological and structural properties of the SLC13 gene family.
