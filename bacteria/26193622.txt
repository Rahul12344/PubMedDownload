BACKGROUND & AIMS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), IBD
diagnosed at 5 years of age or younger, frequently presents with a different and 
more severe phenotype than older-onset IBD. We investigated whether patients with
VEO-IBD carry rare or novel variants in genes associated with immunodeficiencies 
that might contribute to disease development.
METHODS: Patients with VEO-IBD and parents (when available) were recruited from
the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from March 2013 through July 2014. We
analyzed DNA from 125 patients with VEO-IBD (age, 3 wk to 4 y) and 19 parents, 4 
of whom also had IBD. Exome capture was performed by Agilent SureSelect V4, and
sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Alignment to human
genome GRCh37 was achieved followed by postprocessing and variant calling. After 
functional annotation, candidate variants were analyzed for change in protein
function, minor allele frequency less than 0.1%, and scaled combined
annotation-dependent depletion scores of 10 or less. We focused on genes
associated with primary immunodeficiencies and related pathways. An additional
210 exome samples from patients with pediatric IBD (n = 45) or adult-onset
Crohn's disease (n = 20) and healthy individuals (controls, n = 145) were
obtained from the University of Kiel, Germany, and used as control groups.
RESULTS: Four hundred genes and regions associated with primary immunodeficiency,
covering approximately 6500 coding exons totaling more than 1 Mbp of coding
sequence, were selected from the whole-exome data. Our analysis showed novel and 
rare variants within these genes that could contribute to the development of
VEO-IBD, including rare heterozygous missense variants in IL10RA and previously
unidentified variants in MSH5 and CD19.
CONCLUSIONS: In an exome sequence analysis of patients with VEO-IBD and their
parents, we identified variants in genes that regulate B- and T-cell functions
and could contribute to pathogenesis. Our analysis could lead to the
identification of previously unidentified IBD-associated variants.
