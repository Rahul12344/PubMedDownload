PROBLEM: During human pregnancy, the uterine lining is highly populated with
killer-immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-expressing NK cells that recognize
HLA-C molecules on trophoblast cells. The goal of this study was to analyze the
KIR gene contents and frequencies in a N. American cohort of women with RPL of
unknown etiology to evaluate whether there is a genetic susceptibility to RPL
based on a woman's KIR repertoire and her HLA-C group, as well as the HLA-C group
of the partner.
METHOD OF STUDY: The frequencies of KIR and HLA-C1 and HLA-C2 genes were
evaluated in 139 Caucasian women with RPL; HLA-C1, and HLA-C2 group genes were
analyzed in their partners (n = 42). The gene frequencies were compared with data
reported from corresponding populations.
RESULTS: Overall, the frequencies of HLA-C groups and KIR genes and genotypes in 
RPL cohort resembled the frequencies for US Caucasians. The HLA-C1 and HLA-C2
group distribution was significantly different between women with or without
KIR2DS1. Women positive for KIR2DS1 (45.3% of the study cohort) had an increased 
frequency of its ligand, HLA-C2 (0.5159 versus 0.3684 in KIR2DS1 negative women, 
P = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that among KIR2DS1 pos women, the co-expression 
of HLA-C2 is associated with RPL.
