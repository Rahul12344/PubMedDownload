Microbial communities play a crucial role in bioremediation of pollutants in
contaminated ecosystem. In addition to pure culture isolation and bacterial 16S
rRNA based community studies, the focus has now shifted employing the omics
technologies enormously for understanding the microbial diversity and functional 
potential of soil samples. Our previous report on two pesticide-contaminated
sites revealed the diversity of both culturable and unculturable bacteria. In the
present study, we have observed distinct taxonomic and functional communities in 
contaminated soil with respect to an uncontaminated soil as control by using
shotgun metagenomic sequencing method. Our data demonstrated that Proteobacteria,
Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria significantly
dominated the microbial diversity with their cumulative abundance percentage in
the range of 98.61, 87.38, and 80.52 for Hindustan Insecticides Limited (HIL),
India Pesticides Limited (IPL), and control respectively. Functional gene
analysis demonstrated the presence of large number of both substrate specific
upper pathway and common lower pathway degradative genes. Relatively lower number
of genes was found encoding the degradation of styrene, atrazine, bisphenol,
dioxin, and naphthalene. When three bacteria were augumentated with rhamnolipid
(20-100 μM) and Triton X-100 (84-417 μM) surfactants in HIL soil, an enhanced
degradation to 76%, 70%, and 58% of HCH, Endosulfan, and DDT respectively was
achieved. The overall data obtained from two heavily contaminated soil suggest
the versatility of the microbial communities for the xenobiotic pollutant
degradation which may help in exploiting their potential applications in
bioremediation.
