Ring hydroxylation and coupled rearrangement reactions catalyzed by
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase were studied with the QM/MM method
ONIOM(B3LYP:AMBER). For electrophilic attack of the ferryl species on the
aromatic ring, five channels were considered: attacks on the three ring atoms
closest to the oxo ligand (C1, C2, C6) and insertion of oxygen across two bonds
formed by them (C1-C2, C1-C6). For the subsequent migration of the carboxymethyl 
substituent, two possible directions were tested (C1→C2, C1→C6), and two
different mechanisms were sought (stepwise radical, single-step heterolytic). In 
addition, formation of an epoxide (side)product and benzylic hydroxylation, as
catalyzed by the closely related hydroxymandelate synthase, were investigated.
From the computed reaction free energy profiles it follows that the most likely
mechanism of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase involves electrophilic attack on
the C1 carbon of the ring and subsequent single-step heterolytic migration of the
substituent. Computed values of the kinetic isotope effect for this step are
inverse, consistent with available experimental data. Electronic structure
arguments for the preferred mechanism of attack on the ring are also presented.
