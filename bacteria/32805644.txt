Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from gram negative bacteria cell wall is known
to cause ruminal acidosis and/or infectious diseases such as metritis and
mastitis which has a significant negative impact on the reproductive performance.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of LPS on oocyte maturation and
subsequent development in vitro. Ovine cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were
matured in a medium supplemented with 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/mL LPS.
Nuclear maturation, cleavage and blastocyst rate, mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨm), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and changes 
to the transcript abundance were evaluated. In case of the maturation rate, the
percentage of oocytes reaching the MII stage was lower following exposure to
10 μg/mL LPS in comparison to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the
blastocyst rate decreased in case of 1 and 10 μg/mL LPS when compared to the
control group (P < 0.05). ROS overproduction accompanied by a decreased ΔΨm were 
recorded in LPS treated oocytes in comparison to the control group (P < 0.05).
The 3' tag digital gene expression profiling method revealed that 7887 genes were
expressed while only seven genes exhibited changes in the transcript abundance
following exposure to LPS. Tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25), Tripartite
motif containing 26 (TRIM26), Zona Pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3), Family with
sequence similarity 50-member A (FAM50A), Glyoxalate and hydroxy pyruvate
reductase (GRHPR), NADH ubiquinase oxireductase subunit A8 (NDUFA8) were
down-regulated (P < 0.05), while only Centrin 3 (CETN3) was up-regulated
(P < 0.05). Our findings show that LPS has undesirable effects on the maturation 
competence of ovine oocytes and subsequent embryo development. In addition, the
transcriptomic profiling results may shed more light on the molecular mechanisms 
of LPS-induced infertility in ruminants.
