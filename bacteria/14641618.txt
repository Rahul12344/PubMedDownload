We report the case of a 78-year-old woman who suffered from a severe soft tissue 
and bone infection of her left knee 3 years after a total knee-joint replacement 
without loosening of her endoprosthesis. Cultures from joint aspiration and
tissue specimen identified Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Direct
microscopic examination of vital spongy bone and fibrous tissue revealed
microabscesses and seeds of yeasts inside the fatty marrow and interface. After
removal of the prosthesis several soft tissue and bone specimens were taken
during planned re-operations. The histological examination showed no
morphological changing, no reduction or extinction of the yeast cells under
fluconazole therapy with a dosage of 6 mg kg(-1) body weight (400 mg daily).
Curing of the fungal infection with eradication of the yeasts in the bony
specimens was achieved with higher doses of 12 mg kg(-1) body weight (800 mg
day(-1)) over a 2 month regimen in combination with repeated surgical
debridements.
