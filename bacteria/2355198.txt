The fourth component of complement (C4) is crucial to the activation of the
classical complement pathway, a key defense against invading microorganisms. The 
two isotypes of C4, C4A and C4B, have very different in vitro activities. An
increased incidence of total C4B deficiency was found in white patients with
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Neisseria meningitidis
infection (14% of bacteremic children vs. 2% of race-matched controls, P = .02). 
In black patients, however, there was no difference in incidence of C4B
deficiency between bacteremic patients and race-matched controls (7% and 5%,
respectively, P greater than .5). These data suggest that, at least in whites,
total C4B deficiency is a risk factor for invasive disease with these three
encapsulated organisms.
