Fifteen different natural inhibitors of angiogenesis have now been identified
that are produced by mammalian cells and are able to block in vivo
neovascularization. The majority of these are able to inhibit endothelial cell
activities in vitro and all those tested have demonstrated significant antitumor 
activity. Most normal cells produce inhibitors of neovascularization that must be
downregulated before the cells can develop into angiogenic, malignant tumors. In 
several cases the production of inhibitors ceases when tumor suppressor genes are
inactivated. In the BT549 human breast carcinoma cell line, the reintroduction of
a wild type p53 tumor suppressor gene resulted in the stimulation of the
secretion of an inhibitor of angiogenesis, thrombospondin-1, and as a result the 
cells lost their angiogenic phenotype and became able to suppress angiogenesis
induced by the parental tumor line. These results provide a new example of tumor 
suppressor gene control of a natural inhibitor of angiogenesis and add support to
the concept that thrombospondin loss may play an important role in the
development of some human breast cancers.
