In this study, an Alcaligenes sp. strain DG-5 that can effectively degrade
dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethanes (DDTs) under aerobic conditions was isolated
from DDTs-contaminated sediment. Various factors that affect the biodegradation
of DDTs by DG-5 were investigated. About 88 %, 65 % and 45 % of the total DDTs
were consumed within 120 h when their initial concentrations were 0.5, 5 and 15
mg L⁻¹, respectively. However, almost no degradation was observed when their
concentration was increased to 30 mg L⁻¹, but the addition of nutrients
significantly improved the degradation, and 66 % and 90 % of the total DDTs were 
degraded at 336 h in the presence of 5 g L⁻¹ peptone and yeast extract,
respectively. Moreover, the addition of 20 mM formate also enhanced the ability
of DG-5 to transform DDTs, and its DDT transformation capacity (T(c)) value was
increased by 1.8 - 2.7 fold for the pure (p,p'-DDT or o,p'-DDT only) and mixed
systems (p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE). Furthermore, it was found
that competitive inhibition in the biodegradation by DDT compounds occurred in
the mixed system.
