DDT metabolites and analogs: ring fission by Hydrogenomonas.

Focht DD, Alexander M.

A Hydrogenomonas cleaved one of the rings of p,p'-dichlorodiphenylmethane, a
product of DDT metabolism, to yield p-chlorophenylacetate and further metabolized
the latter compound. Products of microbial degradation of other diphenylmethanes 
were also identified. Substituents on the methylene-carbon and para-chloro
substitution are critical factors governing resistance of DDT and related
compounds to aerobic metabolism and decomposition by the bacterium.
