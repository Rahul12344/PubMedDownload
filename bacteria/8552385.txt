The major histocompatibility complex class I enhancer is the target for
adenovirus-12 E1A-mediated down-regulation of class I transcription. In Ad12
transformed rodent cells, the class I enhancer is down-regulated through
increased binding of the repressor COUP-TF to the R2 element and decreased
binding of the activator NF-kappa B (p50/p65) to the R1 element. The reduced
surface levels of class I antigens contribute to the tumorigenic potential of
Ad12 transformed cells by favoring their immunoescape from cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes. Previous studies using transformed cells containing hybrid
Ad5/Ad12 E1A (plus Ad12 E1B) genes have indicated that sequences within the first
exon of the 266R Ad12 E1A gene are required for class I down-regulation and
tumorigenesis. In this study we demonstrate that these same sequences, which
exclude the Ad12 CR3 transactivation domain, are also required for increased
COUP-TF binding to the R2 element and decreased NF-kappa B binding to the R1
element of the class I enhancer. We further show that diminished NF-kappa B
binding is not due to a lack of NF-kappa B1-p50 in the nuclei of Ad12 transformed
rat cells.
