BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB),
especially the drug-resistant MTB, poses serious challenges to human healthcare
worldwide. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a vital role in immune defense
against MTB.
OBJECTIVE: To identify novel CTL epitopes that could induce cellular immunity
against MTB infections.
METHODS: The HLA-A*0201 restricted CTL epitopes of the drug-resistant protein
InhA from MTB were predicted by online algorisms and synthesized by the Fmoc
solid phase method. The candidate peptides were used to induce CTLs from human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A*0201 healthy donors and the
HLA-2.1/Kb mice. IFN-γ productions of CTLs were detected by enzyme linked
immunospot assay (ELISPOT), flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), and cytotoxicity was analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay.
RESULTS: A group of 4 epitopes were screened out with high affinities to
HLA-A*0201. ELISPOT and flow cytometry analysis indicated these peptides
significantly induced that IFN-γ release of CTLs from the HLA-A*0201+/PPD+
donors, as the mutant analogues had more potent stimulation effects. LDH assay
showed that CTLs from PPD+ donors and the immunized mice exhibited significant
cytotoxicity and low cross-reactivity. ELISA analysis revealed comparative levels
of IFN-γ were released by CTLs isolated from the mice spleen.
CONCLUSION: Our study has identified 4 novel CTL epitopes of InhA that could
elicit potent CTL immunity, establishing a foundation for the development of
multivalent peptide vaccines against the drug-resistant MTB.
