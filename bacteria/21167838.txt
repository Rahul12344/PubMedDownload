AIMS: We previously reported that Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) has beneficial
effects in experimental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by suppressing inflammatory
immune responses. The major purpose of this study was to evaluate therapeutic
effects of L. casei on pathological responses in experimental rodent model of
osteoarthritis (OA).
MAIN METHODS: Experimental OA was induced by intra-articular injection of
monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) in Wistar rats. L. casei alone or together with type
II collagen (CII) and glucosamine (Gln) was orally administered into OA rats. The
pathophysiological aspects of OA were investigated by analyzing mechanical
hyperalgesia and histology of articular tissues. Expression of inflammatory
molecules was analyzed in CD4(+) T cells, synovial fibroblasts, and chondrocytes 
by quantitative real-time PCR.
KEY FINDINGS: Oral administration of L. casei together with CII and Gln more
effectively reduced pain, cartilage destruction, and lymphocyte infiltration than
the treatment of Gln or L. casei alone. This co-administration also decreased
expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-2,
IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ))
and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13), while up-regulating
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). These results are concomitant with 
reduced translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and increased expression of the
tissue inhibitor of MMP1 (TIMP1) and CII in chondrocytes.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides evidence that L. casei could act as a potent
nutraceutical modulator for OA treatment by reducing pain, inflammatory
responses, and articular cartilage degradation.
