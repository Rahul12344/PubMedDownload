Mounting evidence suggests an important role for CCAAT-enhancer binding protein
delta (C/EBPδ) in the acute-phase response after bacterial infection. However,
whether C/EBPδ limits pneumonia remains elusive and is the aim of this study.
Therefore, bacterial outgrowth, inflammatory responses, inflammatory cell influx,
and survival were assessed in wild-type and C/EBPδ(-/-) mice infected with
Klebsiella pneumoniae via the airways. We showed that C/EBPδ expression is highly
induced in the lung during pulmonary infection and that Klebsiella-induced
mortality was significantly increased among C/EBPδ(-/-) mice. Bacterial loads and
inflammatory responses were similar in wild-type and C/EBPδ(-/-) mice early
during infection, whereas bacterial loads were increased in C/EBPδ(-/-) mice
later during infection. Moreover, macrophage numbers were reduced in lungs of
C/EBPδ(-/-) mice. In vitro experiments showed that C/EBPδ only slightly affects
macrophage function. Our data thus show that C/EBPδ contributes to host defense
against Klebsiella-induced pneumonia and suggests that C/EBPδ-dependent
macrophage mobilization is a key mechanism.
