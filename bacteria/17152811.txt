In chronic otitis media molecular pathogenetic mechanisms are still unknown,
however, angiogenesis may play a role. The aim of the study was to determine the 
intensity of angiogenesis in granulation tissue in chronic otitis media of
different clinical course. Twenty six granulation tissue specimens (twenty
two--from chronic otitis media, four--from prolongated otitis externa) taken
during surgery were analyzed. The angiogenesis (microvessel density) was measured
in paraffin-embedded tissue by an immunohistochemical method, by staining for
endothelial cells with a monoclonal antibody against CD 34. The presence of CD 34
was found in all specimens. The expression was more intense in tissue samples
from the group with good clinical course (good healing and without recurrence)
than those in the group with poor healing and recurrence (mean number of dots for
mm2 589,2 vs 533,3, respectively) and from the group without bacterial infection 
by Pseudomonas aeruginosa than those with this infection (mean number of dots for
mm2 645,5 vs 440,8, respectively), but differences were not significant. In
conclusion it is suggested that angiogenesis may contribute to different clinical
course of chronic otitis media.
