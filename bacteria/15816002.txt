NKT cells are a CD1d-restricted T cell subset with strong immunoregulatory
properties. Human NKT deficiencies are associated with autoimmune diseases such
as type 1 diabetes and several types of cancer, yet there is little understanding
of how the human NKT cell pool develops or is maintained. In this study, we
present the first detailed analysis of human NKT cells from donor-matched
postnatal thymus and blood samples. In mice, NKT cells are a thymus-dependent
population that migrates to the periphery at an immature stage. Our data show
that human NKT cells also undergo early stages of development in the thymus,
forming a CD4(+)CD161(-/low) population that predominates neonatal thymic and
blood NKT cell pools. CD4(-) and CD161(+) NKT cells accumulate with age in the
blood, but not thymus, to the point that they dominate the NKT cell compartment
in adult blood. This is consistent with the post-thymic maturation of NKT cells
exported from the thymus at the putatively immature CD4(+)CD161(-/low) stage.
Interestingly, while thymus and peripheral NKT cell frequencies vary widely
between patients and are relatively stable between age groups, there is no clear 
relationship between the NKT cell frequency in thymus and blood.
