Annexin A2 (ANXA2), a phospholipid-binding protein, has multiple biological
functions depending on its cellular localization. We previously demonstrated that
IFN-γ-triggered ANXA2 secretion is associated with exosomal release. Here, we
show that IFN-γ-induced autophagy is essential for the extracellular secretion of
ANXA2 in lung epithelial cells. We observed colocalization of ANXA2-containing
autophagosomes with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) after IFN-γ stimulation,
followed by exosomal release. IFN-γ-induced exophagic release of ANXA2 could not 
be observed in ATG5-silenced or mutant RAB11-expressing cells. Furthermore,
knockdown of RAB8A and RAB27A, but not RAB27B, reduced IFN-γ-triggered ANXA2
secretion. Surface translocation of ANXA2 enhanced efferocytosis by epithelial
cells, and inhibition of different exophagic steps, including autophagosome
formation, fusion of autophagosomes with MVBs, and fusion of amphisomes with
plasma membrane, reduced ANXA2-mediated efferocytosis. Our data reveal a novel
route of IFN-γ-induced exophagy of ANXA2.
