Human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) and human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) are new members
of the defensin family. In this study, we investigated their gene expressions in 
the respiratory epithelial surface of the human lung and their bactericidal
activities against Escherichia coli. Both hBD-1 and hBD-2 gene transcripts were
detected in human lung tissue and cellular component of bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Synthetic hBD-1 and
hBD-2 had dose-dependent bactericidal activities against E. coli. The
concentration for the 50% colony reduction of hBD-2 was 0.46 nmol/ml, that for
HNP-1 2.15 nmol/ml, and hBD-1 99.3 nmol/ml under conditions nearly the same as in
human bronchial airway surface liquid. We prepared an antiserum against hBD-2 and
established a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay and quantified plasma hBD-2
concentrations in normal subjects and patients with pneumonia. The plasma
concentration of hBD-2 in normal individuals was 8.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/ml (mean +/-
SE). The mean hBD-2 plasma concentration for the 12 patients with bacterial
pneumonia in the acute stage was 34.2 +/- 3.4 fmol/ml, significantly higher than 
normal individuals, and returned to the normal range after recovery. The presence
of hBD-1 and hBD-2 in the airway tract and their bactericidal activity suggest
that they function in innate airway mucosal defense.
