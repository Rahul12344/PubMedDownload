As many as 91 children with the nephrotic and hematuric forms of primary chronic 
glomerulonephritis were examined for the presence of streptococcal infection and 
allergic diseases. It has been shown that as compared to patients with the
hematuric form of chronic glomerulonephritis, those with the nephrotic form
manifest a higher occurrence of A3, a dramatic rise of serum IgE and its
dependence on the activity of glomerulonephritis. The data obtained may attest to
the etiological role played by allergy in the development of the nephrotic form
of glomerulonephritis. Frequently occurring colonization of hemolytic
streptococcus in the fauces and the rise of the ASL-O titer in the blood serum
seen in patients with the hematuric form of glomerulonephritis, its dependence on
the disease activity suggest the streptococcal etiology in patients with that
form in contrast to those with the nephrotic form.
