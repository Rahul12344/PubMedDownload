An investigation of mortality of piglets through clinical signs, post-mortem,
histopathology and bacteriological analyses revealed the causal organism to be
Escherichia coli, mainly O149:K91:K88 which belongs to the enterotoxigenic
biotypes. Molecular characterization and epidemiologic analysis elucidated it as 
shiga-toxin (ST) E. coli resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tylosin and neomycin. Conventional PCR results
detected genes for ST-2, adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-1) and F18
fimbriae virulence factors. Survival analyses and logistic regression of piglet
mortality patterns showed that season of weaning, weaning weight and age of dam
had significant influence on survival rate of piglets. Factors affecting
pathogenicity of bowel edema and survival of affected piglets on a farm with
persistent infection were reported for the first time. An association of E. coli 
O149:K91:K88 (F4) with clinical edema disease was made even though it has been
reported in the past that this serotype does not produce ST. It was concluded
that more stringent measures to mitigate the impact of the disease need to be
targeted for spring and in older sows.
