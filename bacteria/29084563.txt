Tuberculosis is a devastating infectious disease causing many deaths worldwide.
Recent investigations have implicated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in
the host response to tuberculosis. The aim of the current study was to obtain
evidence for NETs release in the circulation during human tuberculosis. For this 
we measured the plasma concentrations of nucleosomes in conjunction with
neutrophil elastase, in 64 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and 32
healthy controls. Patients with active tuberculosis had elevated plasma levels of
nucleosomes and elastase when compared with local healthy blood donors.
Furthermore nucleosome and elastase levels showed a positive correlation. These
findings provide the first evidence for the release of NETs in the circulation of
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis.
