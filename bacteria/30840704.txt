Replicative DNA polymerases are frequently stalled at damaged template strands.
Stalled replication forks are restored by the DNA damage tolerance (DDT)
pathways, error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) to cope with excessive DNA 
damage, and error-free template switching (TS) by homologous DNA recombination.
PDIP38 (Pol-delta interacting protein of 38 kDa), also called Pol δ-interacting
protein 2 (PolDIP2), physically associates with TLS DNA polymerases, polymerase η
(Polη), Polλ, and PrimPol, and activates them in vitro. It remains unclear
whether PDIP38 promotes TLS in vivo, since no method allows for measuring
individual TLS events in mammalian cells. We disrupted the PDIP38 gene,
generating PDIP38-/- cells from the chicken DT40 and human TK6 B cell lines.
These PDIP38-/- cells did not show a significant sensitivity to either UV or
H2O2, a phenotype not seen in any TLS-polymerase-deficient DT40 or TK6 mutants.
DT40 provides a unique opportunity of examining individual TLS and TS events by
the nucleotide sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin variable (Ig V) gene as
the cells continuously diversify Ig V by TLS (non-templated Ig V hypermutation)
and TS (Ig gene conversion) during in vitro culture. PDIP38-/- cells showed a
shift in Ig V diversification from TLS to TS. We measured the relative usage of
TLS and TS in TK6 cells at a chemically synthesized UV damage (CPD) integrated
into genomic DNA. The loss of PDIP38 also caused an increase in the relative
usage of TS. The number of UV-induced sister chromatid exchanges, TS events
associated with crossover, was increased a few times in PDIP38-/- human and
chicken cells. Collectively, the loss of PDIP38 consistently causes a shift in
DDT from TLS to TS without enhancing cellular sensitivity to DNA damage. We
propose that PDIP38 controls the relative usage of TLS and TS increasing usage of
TLS without changing the overall capability of DDT.
