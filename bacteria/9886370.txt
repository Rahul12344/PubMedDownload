Human CD34+CD38- hematopoietic precursor cells from fetal liver are able to
develop into T, NK, and dendritic cells in a hybrid human/mouse fetal thymic
organ culture (FTOC). In this report, we pay particular attention to the early
events in differentiation of these precursor cells. We show that the CD34+CD38-
precursor cells, which are CD4-CD7-cyCD3-HLA-DR-/++ (cy, cytoplasmatic),
differentiate into a CD4+ population that remained CD7-cyCD3-HLA-DR++ and a CD4- 
population that expressed CD7 and cyCD3. The CD4+CD7-cyCD3- cells differentiate
into phenotypically and functionally mature dendritic cells, but do not
differentiate into T or NK cells. The CD4-CD7+cyCD3+ population later
differentiates into a CD4+CD7+cyCD3+HLA-DR- population, which has no potential to
differentiate into dendritic cells but is able to differentiate into NK cells and
gammadelta and alphabeta T lymphocytes. These findings support the notion that
the T/NK split occurs downstream of the NK/dendritic split.
