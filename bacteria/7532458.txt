T cells provide help for B cell antibody production by cell-cell contact and by
soluble factors. CD40L is the predominant protein induced on activated T cells
which constitutes contact-dependent help, and lack of CD40L or blocking
CD40-CD40L interactions leads to severely impaired antibody production. In
addition to CD40-CD40L, B and T cells express costimulatory, accessory molecules 
which amplify T and B cell function and allow for reciprocal dialogues during
antigen presentation. Interactions between costimulatory counter-receptors can
determine lymphocyte activation or nonresponsiveness, and provides a means for
regulating self-tolerance.
