The role of HLA-A*6802-restricted CD8+ T cells in chlamydial disease was
investigated in human ocular infections. Peptides with predicted binding motifs
for HLA-A*6802 were synthesized using sequences based on chlamydial antigens,
major outer membrane protein (MOMP), macrophage infectivity potentiator (MIP) and
heat shock protein (hsp70). Peptides were pooled according to Chlamydia
trachomatis protein type and serovar, and were tested in 51Cr-release cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, using peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from subjects living in trachoma-endemic 
communities in The Gambia. Significant CTL activity or interferon-gamma release
was not detected in any of the subjects, suggesting either that HLA-A*6802 CD8+ T
cells may not be important in ocular infections or that the peptides chosen did
not represent epitopes.
