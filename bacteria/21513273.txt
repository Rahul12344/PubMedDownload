DesII, a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme from Streptomyces
venezuelae, catalyzes the deamination of TDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose to
TDP-3-keto-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose in the desosamine biosynthetic pathway. DesII
can also catalyze the dehydrogenation of TDP-D-quinovose to the corresponding
3-keto sugar. Similar to other radical SAM enzymes, DesII catalysis has been
proposed to proceed via a radical mechanism. This hypothesis is now confirmed by 
EPR spectroscopy with the detection of a TDP-D-quinovose radical intermediate
having a g-value of 2.0025 with hyperfine coupling to two spin 1/2 nuclei, each
with a splitting constant of 33.6 G. A significant decrease in the EPR line width
is observed when the radical is generated in reactions conducted in D(2)O versus 
H(2)O. These results are consistent with a C3 α-hydroxyalkyl radical in which the
p-orbital harboring the unpaired electron spin at C3 is periplanar with the C-H
bonds at both C2 and C4.
