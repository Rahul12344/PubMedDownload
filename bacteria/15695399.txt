A novel strategy achieved the eradication of lung tumor metastases by joint
suppression of angiogenesis in the tumor neovasculature and induction of tumor
cell apoptosis. This was accomplished by CTLs induced by a DNA vaccine encoding
secretory chemokine CCL21 and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin,
overexpressed by both proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature
and tumor cells. Oral delivery of this DNA vaccine by doubly attenuated
Salmonella typhimurium (dam(-) and AroA(-)) to such secondary lymphoid organs as 
Peyer's patches in the small intestine, elicited marked activation of
antigen-presenting dendritic cells, and an effective CD8(+)T cell immune response
against the survivin self-antigen. This resulted in eradication or suppression of
pulmonary metastases of non-small cell lung carcinoma in both prophylactic and
therapeutic settings in C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, the suppression of angiogenesis 
induced by the vaccine did not impair wound healing or fertility of treated mice.
It is anticipated that such novel DNA vaccines will aid in the rational design of
future strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancer.
