The spleen combines the innate and adaptive immune systems in a uniquely
organized way. The excision of spleen will induce many complications, especially 
the increased susceptibility to infections. Recent research shows that besides
playing roles during the immune responses, the spleen is also an important organ 
during immunoregulation, which is different from other secondary lymphoid organs.
This unique function is mainly realized by modulating cell migration and
proliferation in the spleen. This review provides a better understanding of the
functions of this complex organ gained from recent studies.
