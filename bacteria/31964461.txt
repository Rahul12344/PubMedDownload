Two ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI)-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
(KPC)-positive K. pneumoniae strains, including one pandrug resistant, were
isolated in 2019 from two Greek hospitals. The strains were sequence types (ST)s 
258 and 147 and both harboured similar self-transmissible IncA/C2 plasmids
encoding a novel Lys234Arg variant of the Vietnamese extended-spectrum
β-lactamase (VEB)-1, not inhibited by AVI (VEB-25). Conjugal transfer of
VEB-25-encoding plasmids to Escherichia coli yielded CAZ-AVI-resistant clones,
supporting that VEB-25 is directly linked to the derived phenotype.
