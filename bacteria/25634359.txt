The interaction between keratinocytes (KCs) and skin-resident immune cells has an
important role in induction of contact hypersensitivity. A specific subset of γδ 
T cells termed dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) are located in mouse
epidermis, and we have recently shown that DETCs become activated and produce
IL-17 in an IL-1β-dependent manner during contact hypersensitivity. Various
receptors on DETCs, including NKG2D, are involved in DETC responses against
tumors and during wound healing. The ligands for NKG2D (NKG2DL) are
stress-induced proteins such as mouse UL16-binding protein-like transcript 1
(Mult-1), histocompatibility 60 (H60), and retinoic acid early inducible-1
(Rae-1) in mice and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-chain-related 
A (MICA), MHC class I-chain-related B, and UL16-binding protein in humans. Here, 
we show that allergens upregulate expression of the NKG2DL Mult-1, H60, and Rae-1
in cultured mouse KCs and of MICA in primary human KCs. We demonstrate that
Mult-1 is expressed in mouse skin exposed to allergen. Furthermore, we find that 
the vast majority of DETCs in murine epidermis and skin-homing cutaneous
lymphocyte-associated antigen positive γδ T cells in humans express NKG2D.
Finally, we demonstrate that blocking of NKG2D partially inhibits
allergen-induced DETC activation. These findings demonstrate that NKG2D and
NKG2DL are involved in allergen-induced activation of DETCs and indicate that the
NKG2D/NKG2DL pathway might be a potential target for treatment of contact
hypersensitivity.
