Purinergic signaling plays a complex role in inflammation. Nucleotides released
by T lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets during inflammation induce
cellular responses by binding to receptors that regulate intracellular signaling 
pathways. Previous studies have found that purinergic signaling can have both
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, but the roles of specific pathways
in specific cell types are poorly understood. We investigated the role of the
P2Y12 signaling pathway in the activation of T lymphocytes in vitro. We isolated 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and pretreated
them with ADP (a P2Y12 agonist), AR-C69931MX (a P2Y12 antagonist), or both. We
then stimulated PBMC using phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. 
We found that ADP affects T cell responses in term of cell activity and receptor 
expression through both P2Y12-dependent and P2Y12-independent pathways and other 
responses (cytokine secretion) primarily through P2Y12 -independent pathways. The
ADP-mediated effect changed over time and was stimulus-specific.
