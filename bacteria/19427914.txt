Dendritic cells (DCs) link the innate and adaptive immune system. Currently,
murine DCs for cell biology investigations are developed from MHC class
II-negative bone marrow (BM) precursor cells, non-depleted BM cells or BM
monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF). Here we demonstrate an isolation procedure of functionally intact
myeloid CD11c(+) CD11b(+) DCs derived from murine CD34-positive precursors. DCs
derived from CD34(+) cells show functional internalization, maturation, cytokine 
secretion, MHC-restricted antigen presentation, and MHCII retrograde transport of
antigens from the lysosomes to the cell surface. In comparison to the established
method, the advantages of this isolation procedure are a shorter cultivation
period, a superior transfection efficiency, the yield of a purer and more
homogeneous population of immature DCs, and less consumption of cell culture
medium and GM-CSF. The new isolation procedure and the functional quality of
CD34(+) cell-derived murine myeloid DCs make them ideally suited for immunology
and cell biology studies.
