Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) became in the last two decades a global threat to 
public health systems in the world. Since the antibiotic era, with the discovery 
of the first antibiotics that provided consistent health benefits to human
medicine, the misuse and abuse of antimicrobials in veterinary and human medicine
have accelerated the growing worldwide phenomenon of AMR. This article presents
an extensive overview of the epidemiology of AMR, with a focus on the link
between food producing-animals and humans and on the legal framework and policies
currently implemented at the EU level and globally. The ways of responding to the
AMR challenges foresee an array of measures that include: designing more
effective preventive measures at farm level to reduce the use of antimicrobials; 
development of novel antimicrobials; strengthening of AMR surveillance system in 
animal and human populations; better knowledge of the ecology of resistant
bacteria and resistant genes; increased awareness of stakeholders on the prudent 
use of antibiotics in animal productions and clinical arena; and the public
health and environmental consequences of AMR. Based on the global nature of AMR
and considering that bacterial resistance does not recognize barriers and can
spread to people and the environment, the article ends with specific
recommendations structured around a holistic approach and targeted to different
stakeholders.
