Lakes that experience recurrent toxic cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms
(cyanoHABS) are often subject to cultural eutrophication, where landscape
development and upland activities increase the nutrient inputs to the water
column and fuel cyanoHABS. Few studies have focused on the response of a lake to 
nutrient inputs for which the natural geomorphic setting predisposes a
nutrient-rich water column to already support abundant cyanobacteria. Here, we
present a sediment core record from a lake surrounded by parkland that
experiences recurrent cyanoHABs which produce dangerous levels of the neurotoxin,
anatoxin-a, impacting the recreational use of the lake and park. Using
photoautotrophic pigments in the sediment record, we establish cyanobacteria have
long been part of the diverse and abundant phytoplankton community within the
lake. Despite this long record, shotgun metagenome and other DNA analyses of the 
sediment record suggest that the current anatoxin-a producer Dolichospermum sp.
WA102 only emerged to dominate the cyanobacterial community in the mid-1990s. A
period of lakeshore farming that finished in the 1950s-1960s and possibly the
stocking of rainbow trout fry (1970-2016) coincide with a progressive shift in
primary production, together with a change in bacterial communities. Based on the
history of the lake and contemporary ecology of Dolichospermum, we propose that
the legacy of nutrient inputs and changes in nutrient cycling within the lake has
encouraged the development of an ecosystem where the toxin producing
Dolichospermum sp WA102 is highly competitive. Understanding the historical
presence of cyanobacteria in the lake provides a context for current-day
management strategies of cyanoHABs.
