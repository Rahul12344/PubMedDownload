Eupalinilide E was assessed for ex-vivo expansion activity on hematopoietic stem 
cells (HSCs) from human cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells in serum-free, SCF, TPO and
FL stimulated 7 day cultures. Eupalinilide E ex-vivo enhanced phenotyped (p) HSCs
and glycolysis of CD34+ cells isolated 7 days after culture as measured by
extracellular acidification rate, but did not alone show enhanced NSG engrafting 
capability of HSCs as determined by chimerism and numbers of SCID Repopulating
cells, a quantitative measure of functional human HSCs. This is another example
of pHSCs not necessarily recapitulating functional activity of these cells. Lack 
of effect on engrafting HSCs may be due to a number of possibilities, including
down regulation of CXCR4 or of the homing capacity of these treated cells.
However, Eupalinilide did act in an additive to synergistic fashion with UM171 to
enhance ex vivo expansion of both pHSCs, and functionally engrafting HSCs. While 
reasons for the disconnect between pHSC and function of HSCs with Eupalinilide E 
alone cultured CB CD34+ cells is yet to be determined, the data suggest possible 
future use of Eupalinilide and UM171 together to enhance ex vivo production of CB
HSCs for clinical hematopoietic cell transplantation.
