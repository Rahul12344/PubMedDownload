Methoxychlor [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)ethane], a substitute for
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), is a compound of
environmental concern because of potential long-term health risks related to its 
endocrine-disrupting and carcinogenic potency. In order to determine the
metabolic fate of methoxychlor and DDT in the human intestinal gut, Eubacterium
limosum (ATCC 8486), a strict anaerobe isolated from the human intestine that is 
capable of O-demethylation toward O-methylated isoflavones, was used as a model
intestinal microbial organism. Under anaerobic incubation conditions, E. limosum 
completely transformed methoxychlor and DDT in 16 days. Based on gas
chromatography-mass chromatography analyses, the metabolites produced from
methoxychlor and DDT by E. limosum were confirmed to be
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)ethane (methoxydichlor) and
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD), respectively. This study
suggests that E. limosum in the human intestinal gut might be a participant in
the reductive dechlorination of methoxychlor to the more antiandrogenic active
methoxydichlor.
