A human bronchial xenograft model was used to characterize the molecular basis
for the previously described defect in bacterial killing that is present in the
cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Airway surface fluid from CF grafts contained
abnormally high NaCl and failed to kill bacteria, defects that were corrected
with adenoviral vectors. A full-length clone for the only known human
beta-defensin (i.e., hBD-1) was isolated. This gene is expressed throughout the
respiratory epithelia of non-CF and CF lungs, and its protein product shows
salt-dependent antimicrobial activity to P. aeruginosa. Antisense
oligonucleotides to hBD-1 ablated the antimicrobial activity in airway surface
fluid from non-CF grafts. These data suggest that hBD-1 plays an important role
in innate immunity that is compromised in CF by its salt-dependent inactivation.
