Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is common polymer for electrospinning, however, 
its high hydrophobicity is a major drawback, which cause fouling. To introduce
hydrophilicity and antibacterial activity, quaternary ammonium-functionalized
amphiphilic diblock copolymers were synthesized and blended with a PVDF/graphene 
oxide (GO) solution, then, electrospun and coated with a hydrophilic polymer,
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The amphiphilic block copolymer, consisting of a
hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) block and a hydrophilic
poly[N,N-2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl methacrylate) block (PMMA-b-PDMAEMA), was
synthesized. Polymeric quaternary ammonium with three different alkyl chain
lengths (C2, C4, and C8) were successfully introduced to obtain as
q-PMMA-b-PDMAEMA. The q-PMMA-b-PDMAEMA in the nanofiber matrix was confirmed by
C=O bands (1734 cm-1) in the Fourier transform infrared spectra. Nano-sized
spherical protuberances were distributed on the surface as revealed by field
emission scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The
PVDF/GO/q-PMMA-b-PDMAEMA@PVA nanofibers has superhydrophilic properties (water
contact angle = 0-20°) and the pure water flux was generally improved by
increasing the alkyl chain length. When introducing the longest alkyl chain
(C8,OBC), the total fouling ratio was the lowest (49.99%) and the bacteria
removal capacities after 60 min were the highest for both Escherichia coli
(4.2 × 105 CFU/mg) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.1 × 105 CFU/mg) via growth
inhibition and cytoplasmic membrane damage.
