CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T cell responses. Sequence analysis of this
molecule reveals the presence of two cytoplasmic tyrosine residues at positions
165 and 182 that are potential Src homology (SH)-2 domain binding sites. The role
of phosphorylation of these residues in CTLA-4-mediated signaling is unknown.
Here, we show that sole TCR ligation induces zeta-associated protein
(ZAP)-70-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CTLA-4 that is important for cell 
surface retention of this molecule. However, CTLA-4 tyrosine phosphorylation is
not required for down-regulation of T cell activation following CD3-CTLA-4
coengagement. Specifically, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activation and of IL-2 production by CTLA-4-mediated signaling occurs in T 
cells expressing mutant CTLA-4 molecules lacking the cytoplasmic tyrosine
residues, and in lck-deficient or ZAP-70-deficient T cells. Therefore, CTLA-4
function involves interplay between two different levels of regulation:
phosphotyrosine-dependent cell surface retention and phosphotyrosine-independent 
association with signaling molecules.
