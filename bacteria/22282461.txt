Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection has been suggested to be associated with
severe asthma characterized by persistent airway limitation, which may be related
to airway remodelling. We investigated whether C. pneumoniae infection affected
the secretion of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and tissue inhibitor
metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), and altered the responsiveness of inflammatory cells
to corticosteroids. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of C. pneumoniae. Secretion of both 
MMP9 and TIMP1 was strongly suppressed by dexamethasone treatment in uninfected
cells. MMP9 secretion was also significantly inhibited by dexamethasone in C.
pneumoniae-infected cells, but TIMP1 secretion was not; hence the MMP9 to TIMP1
ratio decreased. Interestingly, expression of human glucocorticoid receptor β,
which is believed to confer resistance to corticosteroids, was enhanced by
dexamethasone treatment in C. pneumoniae-infected PBMCs. We conclude that C.
pneumoniae infection may promote airway remodelling by decreasing the ratio of
MMP9 to TIMP1 secreted by inflammatory cells, and by altering cellular
responsiveness to corticosteroids.
