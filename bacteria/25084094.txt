Adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) is a key virulence factor of the whooping cough
agent Bordetella pertussis. The toxin targets CD11b-expressing phagocytes and
delivers into their cytosol an adenylyl cyclase (AC) enzyme that subverts
cellular signaling by increasing cAMP levels. In the present study, we analyzed
the modulatory effects of CyaA on adhesive, migratory and antigen presenting
properties of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated murine and human dendritic cells
(DCs). cAMP signaling of CyaA enhanced TLR-induced dissolution of cell adhesive
contacts and migration of DCs towards the lymph node-homing chemokines CCL19 and 
CCL21 in vitro. Moreover, we examined in detail the capacity of toxin-treated DCs
to induce CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Exposure to CyaA decreased the
capacity of LPS-stimulated DCs to present soluble protein antigen to CD4+ T cells
independently of modulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production, 
and enhanced their capacity to promote CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells
in vitro. In addition, CyaA decreased the capacity of LPS-stimulated DCs to
induce CD8(+) T cell proliferation and limited the induction of IFN-Î³ producing
CD8(+) T cells while enhancing IL-10 and IL-17-production. These results indicate
that through activation of cAMP signaling, the CyaA may be mobilizing DCs
impaired in T cell stimulatory capacity and arrival of such DCs into draining
lymph nodes may than contribute to delay and subversion of host immune responses 
during B. pertussis infection.
