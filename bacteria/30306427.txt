PURPOSE: KAI1 (also called CD82) is a metastasis suppressor gene known to be
downregulated in breast cancer and other solid tumors. The downregulation of KAI1
or loss of its function is usually associated with bad prognosis. The mechanism
behind KAI1 loss of function is complex. In this study, we investigated
"alternative splicing" as a possible mechanism that underlies KAI1 loss of
function in breast cancer patients from a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: Expression of KAI1 was studied in FFPE breast cancer and control tissue 
sections by IHC using two different antibodies targeting different domains of the
protein. The TS82B antibody targets the extracellular loop, which constitutes
most of the protein, while the second EPR4112 antibody targets the C-terminal
intracellular domain of the protein.
RESULTS: Out of 90 breast cancer samples, 67% showed loss of KAI1 expression. The
remaining 33% showed KAI1 expression with (TS82B) antibody; however, the protein 
was detected in only 11% of cancers when using the antibody (EPR4112) indicating 
a truncation of the protein at the C-terminus (truncated-KAI1) in 22% of the
studied cancer samples. A significant correlation was found between
truncated-KAI1 expression and advanced cancer stage (association with lymph node 
metastasis, P value 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Alternative splicing is an important mechanism underlying KAI1 loss
of function in breast cancer, and it is associated with bad prognosis (advanced
cancer stage).
