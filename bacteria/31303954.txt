Introduction: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal
discharge in women of child bearing age. Bacterial vaginosis has emerged as a
global health issue due to the adverse outcome in pregnancy and in the
puerperium. The study determined the prevalence of BV and outcome of delivery
among pregnant women.
Methods: Socio-demographic data and vaginal swab samples were obtained from 362
consecutive pregnant women with abnormal vaginal discharge attending antenatal
clinic in Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti. Data were analysed
using SPSS statistical software 21 and association between variables was compared
using Chi square.
Results: The prevalence of BV among pregnant women with abnormal vaginal
discharge in this study was 16.6%. Age group 25-34yrs, multiparity and higher
education were significantly associated with BV, p < 0.05. Symptoms such as
vulvar itching, dyspareunia, lower abdominal pains and characteristic of vaginal 
discharge such as colour and consistency were significantly associated with BV, p
< 0.05. Women with bacterial vaginosis significantly had prelabour rupture of
fetal membrane and their babies were born prematurely with low birth weight and
Apgar score of less than 5 at one minute, p < 0.05. However, there was no
difference statistically in rate of admission into special care baby unit among
the women, p > 0.05.
Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that there should be screening for
BV in pregnant women presenting with abnormal vaginal discharge so that they
could be treated accordingly. This will mitigate the complications arising from
bacterial vaginosis.
