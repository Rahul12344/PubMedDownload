Traditional nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals hold pragmatic nature with respect 
to their definitions, claims, purposes and marketing strategies. Their
definitions are not well established worldwide. They also have different
regulatory definitions and registration regulatory processes in different parts
of the world. Global prevalence of nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals is
noticeably high with large market share with minimal regulation compared to
traditional drugs. The global market is flooded with nutraceuticals and
cosmeceuticals claiming to be of natural origin and sold with a therapeutic claim
by major online retail stores such as Amazon and eBay. Apart from the traditional
formulations, many manufacturers and researchers use novel formulation
technologies in nutraceutical and cosmeceutical formulations for different
reasons and objectives. Manufacturers tend to differentiate their products with
novel formulations to increase market appeal and sales. On the other hand,
researchers use novel strategies to enhance nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals
activity and safety. The objective of this review is to assess the current
patents and research adopting novel formulation strategies in nutraceuticals and 
cosmeceuticals. Patents and research papers investigating nutraceutical and
cosmeceutical novel formulations were surveyed for the past 15 years. Various
nanosystems and advanced biotechnology systems have been introduced to improve
the therapeutic efficacy, safety and market appeal of nutraceuticals and
cosmeceuticals, including liposomes, polymeric micelles, quantum dots,
nanoparticles, and dendrimers. This review provides an overview of nutraceuticals
and cosmeceuticals current technologies, highlighting their pros, cons,
misconceptions, regulatory definitions and market. This review also aims in
separating the science from fiction in the nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals
development, research and marketing.
