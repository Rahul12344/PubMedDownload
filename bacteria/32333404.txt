BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation is an established treatment
option for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, 147 patients
with MM were compared with 136 patients with NHL regarding the mobilization and
apheresis of blood CD34+ cells, cellular composition of infused blood grafts,
posttransplant recovery, and outcome.
RESULTS: Multiple myeloma patients mobilized CD34+ cells more effectively
(6.3 × 106 /kg vs. 3.9 × 106 /kg, p = 0.001). The proportion of poor mobilizers
(peak blood CD34+ cell count <20 × 106 /L) was higher in NHL patients (15% vs.
3%, p < 0.001). Plerixafor was added to rescue the mobilization failure in 17 MM 
patients (12%) and in 35 NHL patients (26%; p = 0.002). The infused grafts
contained more natural killer (NK) and CD19+ cells in MM patients. Blood platelet
and NK-cell counts were higher in MM patients posttransplant. Early
treatment-related mortality was low in both groups, but NHL patients had a higher
late (>100 days) nonrelapse mortality (NRM; 6% vs. 0%, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and MM patients differ in terms of
mobilization of CD34+ cells, graft cellular composition, and posttransplant
recovery. Thus, the optimal graft characteristics may also be different.
