The yeast-to-hyphal transition is a major virulence factor in the fungal pathogen
Candida albicans. Mutations in the CaKEM1 gene, which encodes a 5'-3'
exoribonuclease responsible for mRNA degradation, show a defect in hyphal growth.
We applied two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify hyphae-specific
proteins that have altered expressions in the presence of the cakem1 mutation.
Eight proteins, Eno1, Eps1, Fba1, Imh3, Lpd1, Met6, Pdc11, and Tsa1 were
upregulated during hyphal transition in wild-type but not in cakem1/cakem1 mutant
cells. A second group of proteins, Idh1, Idh2, and Ssb1, showed increased levels 
of expression in cakem1/cakem1 mutant cells when compared to wild-type cells.
Overexpression of Lpd1, a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, caused
slight hyperfilamentation in a wild-type strain and suppressed the filamentation 
defect of the cakem1 mutation. The Ssb1 protein, which is a potential heat shock 
protein, and the Imh3 protein, which is a putative enzyme in GMP biosynthesis
also showed the filamentation-associated phenotypes.
