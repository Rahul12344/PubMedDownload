Cerebral infarction disease is a severe hypoxic ischemic tissue necrosis in the
brain, often leading to long-term functional disability and residual impairments.
The Notch signaling pathway plays key roles in proliferation and survival of the 
stem/progenitor cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Notch3 is an
important member of the pathway, but the relationships between the genetic
abnormalities and cerebral infarction disease still remain unclear. The aim of
this work was to evaluate variations in Notch3 gene for their possible
associations with the cerebral infarction disease. We sequenced the Notch3 gene
for 260 patients with cerebral infarction disease, 300 normal controls with old
ages and 300 normal controls with younger ages, and identified the variations.
The statistical analyses were conducted using Chi-Square Tests as implemented in 
SPSS (version 19.0). The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test of the population was
carried out using the online software OEGE. Six variations, including rs1044116, 
rs1044009, rs1044006, rs10408676, rs1043996 and rs16980398 within or near the
Notch3 gene, were found. The genetic heterozygosity of rs1044116, rs1044009,
rs1044006, and rs1043996 was very high, whereas that of rs10408676 and rs16980398
was very low. Statistical analyses showed that rs1044009 and rs1044006 were
associated with the risk of cerebral infarction disease in the Chinese Han
agedness population. The SNPs rs1044009 and rs1044006 in the Notch3 gene were
associated with the risk of cerebral infarction diseases in the Chinese Han
agedness population.
