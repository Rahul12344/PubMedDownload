Objectives: To characterize MDR Escherichia coli from bloodstream infections
(BSIs) in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.
Methods: We collected third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) E. coli
from blood cultures in patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial from
February 2014 to August 2015. WGS was used to characterize antibiotic resistance 
genes, MLST, plasmids and phylogenetic relationships. Antibiotic susceptibility
was determined using disc diffusion and Etest.
Results: A total of 70 3GC-R E. coli were included, of which the majority were
ST131 (61.4%). BSI was most frequently from a urinary source (69.6%), community
associated (62.9%) and in older patients (median age 71 years). The median Pitt
score was 1 and ICU admission was infrequent (3.1%). ST131 possessed more
acquired resistance genes than non-ST131 (P = 0.003). Clade C1/C2 ST131
predominated (30.2% and 53.5% of ST131, respectively) and these were all
ciprofloxacin resistant. All clade A ST131 (n = 6) were community associated. The
predominant ESBL types were blaCTX-M (80.0%) and were strongly associated with
ST131 (95% carried blaCTX-M), with the majority blaCTX-M-15. Clade C1 was
associated with blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-27, whereas blaCTX-M-15 predominated in 
clade C2. Plasmid-mediated AmpC genes (mainly blaCMY-2) were frequent (17.1%) but
were more common in non-ST131 (P < 0.001) isolates from Singapore and Brisbane.
Two strains carried both blaCMY-2 and blaCTX-M. The majority of plasmid replicon 
types were IncF.
Conclusions: In a prospective collection of 3GC-R E. coli causing BSI,
community-associated Clade C1/C2 ST131 predominate in association with blaCTX-M
ESBLs, although a significant proportion of non-ST131 strains carried blaCMY-2.
