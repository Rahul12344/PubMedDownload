Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction that is caused by a
dysregulated host response to infection. In sepsis, the immune response that is
initiated by an invading pathogen fails to return to homeostasis, thus
culminating in a pathological syndrome that is characterized by sustained
excessive inflammation and immune suppression. Our understanding of the key
mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis has increased tremendously, yet
this still needs to be translated into novel targeted therapeutic strategies.
Pivotal for the clinical development of new sepsis therapies is the selection of 
patients on the basis of biomarkers and/or functional defects that provide
specific insights into the expression or activity of the therapeutic target.
