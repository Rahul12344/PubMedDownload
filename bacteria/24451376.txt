Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genome instability syndrome characterized by bone marrow
failure and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. In response to
DNA damage, the FA pathway is activated through the cooperation of 16 FA
proteins. A central player in the pathway is a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex or the FA core complex, which monoubiquitinates its substrates FANCD2 and
FANCI. FANCE, a subunit of the FA core complex, plays an essential role by
promoting the integrity of the complex and by directly recognizing FANCD2. To
delineate its role in substrate ubiquitination from the core complex assembly, we
analyzed a series of mutations within FANCE. We report that a phenylalanine
located at the highly conserved extreme C terminus, referred to as Phe-522, is a 
critical residue for mediating the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI
complex. Using the FANCE mutant that specifically disrupts the FANCE-FANCD2
interaction as a tool, we found that the interaction-deficient mutant conferred
cellular sensitivity in reconstituted FANCE-deficient cells to a similar degree
as FANCE null cells, suggesting the significance of the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction 
in promoting cisplatin resistance. Intriguingly, ectopic expression of the FANCE 
C terminus fragment alone in FA normal cells disrupts DNA repair, consolidating
the importance of the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction in the DNA cross-link repair.
