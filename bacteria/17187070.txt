Tyrosine kinases couple the T cell receptor (TCR) to discrete signaling cascades,
each of which is capable of inducing a distinct functional outcome. Precisely how
TCR signals are channeled toward specific targets remains unclear. TCR
stimulation triggers 'alternative' activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase p38, whereby the Lck and Zap70 tyrosine kinases directly activate p38.
Here we report that alternatively activated p38 associated with the Dlgh1 MAGUK
scaffold protein. 'Knockdown' of Dlgh1 expression blocked TCR-induced activation 
of p38 and the transcription factor NFAT but not of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase Jnk or transcription factor NF-kappaB. A Dlgh1 mutant incapable of binding
p38 failed to activate NFAT. Along with reports that the CARMA1 MAGUK scaffold
protein coordinates activation of Jnk and NF-kappaB but not of p38 or NFAT, our
findings identify MAGUK scaffold proteins as 'orchestrators' of TCR signal
specificity.
