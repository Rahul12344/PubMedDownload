Two methods, natural transformation and electro-transformation, for the
introduction of DNA into nine strains of Campylobacter jejuni were compared. Both
methods were successful with a limited number of strains. Natural transformation 
was efficient only for the introduction of C. jejuni chromosomal DNA, while
electro-transformation was also applicable for the introduction of Escherichia
coli-derived vector DNA into at least one C. jejuni strain. The efficiency of DNA
recombination after entry was determined using C. jejuni chromosomal DNA
containing disrupted flagellin genes of C. jejuni or suicide vectors containing a
portion of these genes. In the latter case, DNA recombination occurred with as
little as 200-bp homology present, indicating that only short homologous DNA
segments are required.
