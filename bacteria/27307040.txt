α-Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential nutrient for all vertebrates. From the
eight naturally occurring members of the vitamin E family, α-tocopherol is the
most biologically active species and is selectively retained in tissues. The
hepatic α-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) preferentially selects dietary
α-tocopherol and facilitates its transport through the hepatocyte and its
secretion to the circulation. In doing so, TTP regulates body-wide levels of
α-tocopherol. The mechanisms by which TTP facilitates α-tocopherol trafficking in
hepatocytes are poorly understood. We found that the intracellular localization
of TTP in hepatocytes is dynamic and responds to the presence of α-tocopherol. In
the absence of the vitamin, TTP is localized to perinuclear vesicles that harbor 
CD71, transferrin, and Rab8, markers of the recycling endosomes. Upon treatment
with α-tocopherol, TTP- and α-tocopherol-containing vesicles translocate to the
plasma membrane, prior to secretion of the vitamin to the exterior of the cells. 
The change in TTP localization is specific to α-tocopherol and is time- and
dose-dependent. The aberrant intracellular localization patterns of lipid
binding-defective TTP mutants highlight the importance of protein-lipid
interaction in the transport of α-tocopherol. These findings provide the basis
for a proposed mechanistic model that describes TTP-facilitated trafficking of
α-tocopherol through hepatocytes.
