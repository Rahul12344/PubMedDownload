Alterations in phosphorylation of cellular proteins are a hallmark of malignant
transformation. Degradation of these phosphoproteins could generate
cancer-specific class I MHC-associated phosphopeptides recognizable by CD8+ T
lymphocytes. In a comparative analysis of phosphopeptides presented on the
surface of melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and B lymphoblastoid cells, we find 5 of 
36 that are restricted to the solid tumors and common to both cancers.
Differential presentation of these peptides can result from differential
phosphorylation of the source proteins. Recognition of the peptides on cancer
cells by phosphopeptide-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes validates the potential of
these phosphopeptides as immunotherapeutic targets.
