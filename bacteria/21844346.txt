CD1e is a member of the CD1 family that participates in lipid antigen
presentation without interacting with the T-cell receptor. It binds lipids in
lysosomes and facilitates processing of complex glycolipids, thus promoting
editing of lipid antigens. We find that CD1e may positively or negatively affect 
lipid presentation by CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d. This effect is caused by the capacity
of CD1e to facilitate rapid formation of CD1-lipid complexes, as shown for CD1d, 
and also to accelerate their turnover. Similar results were obtained with
antigen-presenting cells from CD1e transgenic mice in which lipid complexes are
assembled more efficiently and show faster turnover than in WT antigen-presenting
cells. These effects maximize and temporally narrow CD1-restricted responses, as 
shown by reactivity to Sphingomonas paucimobilis-derived lipid antigens. CD1e is 
therefore an important modulator of both group 1 and group 2 CD1-restricted
responses influencing the lipid antigen availability as well as the generation
and persistence of CD1-lipid complexes.
