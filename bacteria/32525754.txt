Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal inflammatory disease 
of premature infants associated with gut bacterial dysbiosis. Using 16S
rRNA-based methods, our laboratory identified an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae 
sequence (NEC_unk_OTU) with high abundance in NEC fecal samples. We aimed to
identify this bacterium and determine its potential role in the disease. NCBI
database searches for the 16S sequence, selective culture systems, biotyping and 
polymerase chain reaction were employed to refine classification of NEC_unk_OTU
and identify toxin-encoding genes from the index NEC case. Bacterial cytotoxin
production was confirmed by mass spectrometry and apoptosis assays. Additional
fecal samples from 9 NEC and 5 non-NEC controls were analyzed using similar
methods and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to investigate
clonal relationships and define sequence types of the isolates. NEC_unk_OTU was
identified as Klebsiella oxytoca, a pathobiont known to cause
antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis, but not previously linked to NEC.
Including the index case, cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca were isolated
from 6 of 10 subjects with NEC; in these, the K. oxytoca 16S sequence
predominated the fecal microbiota. Cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca also
were isolated from 4 of 5 controls; in these, however, the abundance of the
corresponding 16S sequence was very low. MLST analysis of the toxin-positive
isolates demonstrated no clonal relationships and similar genetic clustering
between cases and controls. These results suggest cytotoxin-producing strains of 
K. oxytoca colonize a substantial proportion of premature infants. Some, perhaps 
many, cases of NEC may be precipitated by outgrowth of this opportunistic
pathogen.
