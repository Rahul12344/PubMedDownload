Previously we reported that serum leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG) binds
cytochrome c (Cyt c; Cummings et al., Apoptosis 11:1121-1129, 2009). Here we show
that LRG binding to Cyt c is similar to that of Apaf-1. LRG and Apaf-1 share
partial amino acid sequences, compete for binding Cyt c, and are inhibited by
modification at lysine 72 in Cyt c. However, in contrast to Apaf-1, LRG acts as a
survival factor in vitro rather than a pro-apoptotic factor. By depleting LRG
from culture medium we found that LRG protects against a toxic effect of
exogenous Cyt c on lymphocytes that would otherwise result in an apoptotic
phenotype. LRG, as well as antibodies specific for Cyt c, increased cell
viability in the absence of added Cyt c indicating that Cyt c released by dying
cells in the cultures is itself toxic. Protection from extracellular Cyt
c-induced lymphotoxicity appears to involve an active mechanism rather than
steric hindrance of Cyt c. Thus, serum LRG when bound to extracellular Cyt c that
is released from apoptotic cells acts as a survival factor for lymphocytes and
possibly other cells that are susceptible to the toxic effect of extracellular
Cyt c.
