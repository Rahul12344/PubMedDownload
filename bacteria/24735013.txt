Cystomanamides A-D were isolated as novel natural product scaffolds from
Cystobacter fuscus MCy9118, and their structures were established by
spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR, LC-SPE-NMR/-MS, and HR-MS. The
cystomanamides contain β-hydroxy amino acids along with 3-amino-9-methyldecanoic 
acid that is N-glycosylated in cystomanamide C and D. The gene cluster for
cystomanamide biosynthesis was identified by gene disruption as PKS/NRPS hybrid
incorporating an iso-fatty acid as starter unit and including a reductive
amination step at the interface of the PKS and NRPS modules.
