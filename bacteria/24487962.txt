The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein controls multiple tumour suppressive
functions and is downregulated in diverse types of human cancers through
incompletely characterized post-translational mechanisms. Here we identify USP11 
as a PML regulator by RNAi screening. USP11 deubiquitinates and stabilizes PML,
thereby counteracting the functions of PML ubiquitin ligases RNF4 and the
KLHL20-Cul3 (Cullin 3)-Roc1 complex. We find that USP11 is transcriptionally
repressed through a Notch/Hey1-dependent mechanism, leading to PML
destabilization. In human glioma, Hey1 upregulation correlates with USP11 and PML
downregulation and with high-grade malignancy. The Notch/Hey1-induced
downregulation of USP11 and PML not only confers multiple malignant
characteristics of aggressive glioma, including proliferation, invasiveness and
tumour growth in an orthotopic mouse model, but also potentiates self-renewal,
tumour-forming capacity and therapeutic resistance of patient-derived
glioma-initiating cells. Our study uncovers a PML degradation mechanism through
Notch/Hey1-induced repression of the PML deubiquitinase USP11 and suggests an
important role for this pathway in brain tumour pathogenesis.
