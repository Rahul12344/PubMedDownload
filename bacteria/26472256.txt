Chironomids are freshwater insects that undergo a complete metamorphosis of four 
life stages. Chironomid egg masses can be degraded by Vibrio cholerae and some
Aeromonas species. Egg mass degradation by V. cholerae requires haemagglutinin
protease activity. Our aim was to identify the egg mass degrading (EMD) factor
secreted by Aeromonas dhkanesis 3K1C15. Following the hypothesis that the EMD
factor of A. dhkanesis is also a protease, secreted proteases were screened, but 
none of them proved to have the same properties as the EMD factor. Using
conventional protein purification methods, we found that the active fraction
included chitinases. We further confirmed chitin as a building block of the egg
masses. Interestingly, by supplementing bacterial growth media with chitin, we
observed unexpected EMD factor activity in Aeromonas isolates that initially were
not able to degrade egg masses. Accordingly, we concluded that although strain
3K1C15 secretes chitinases constitutively, most Aeromonas strains secrete
chitinases inductively. Induction of chitinases in nature presumably occurs when 
bacteria are attached to the egg mass habitat, in which chitin is abundant.
Considering that chitinases are highly conserved across bacteria phyla, we assume
that the role of this enzyme in the bacteria-insect interplay could be wider than
is currently thought.
