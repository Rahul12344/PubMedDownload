Investigations of indoor air of the homes of seven patients with asthma
bronchiale who showed up with positive reactions following intracutaneous
application of fungal allergens revealed that their places of residence were
contaminated by fungal and bacterial spores. The number of colony forming units
of mesophilic fungal spores of the indoor air ranged from 100 to 1000 CFU/m3 and 
this was much higher than the mould flora of the outdoor air determined
simultaneously. The major fungi species found by the indoor investigation were:
Penicillium sp. > Aspergillus sp. > Cladosporium sp., Mucor sp., Chrysonilia sp.,
Verticillium sp. > Geotrichum sp., Trichoderma sp. In two cases Thermoactinomyces
species could be detected in the indoor air. The main cause of fungal
contamination were moist building materials on room walls, insufficient air
ventilation, bad maintenance of the circulating air-machines and insufficient
room hygiene (e.g. biological garbage in the kitchen).
