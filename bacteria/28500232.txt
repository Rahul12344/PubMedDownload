Two new bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE) molecules with specificity for NKG2D
ligands were developed and functionally characterized. One, huNKG2D-OKT3, was
derived from the extracellular portion of the human NKG2D receptor fused to a
CD3ε binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv), known as OKT3. NKG2D has
multiple ligands, including MICA, which are expressed by a variety of malignant
cells. A second molecule, B2-OKT3, was created in the tandem scFv BiTE format
that targets MICA on tumor cells and CD3ε on human T cells. Both BiTEs
specifically activated T cells to kill human tumor cell lines. Cytotoxicity by
B2-OKT3, but not huNKG2D-OKT3, is blocked by soluble rMICA. The huNKG2D-OKT3
induced greater T-cell cytokine production in comparison with B2-OKT3. No T-cell 
pretreatment was required for IFNγ production upon coculture of B2-OKT3 or
huNKG2D-OKT3 with T cells and target cells. The effector memory T-cell
compartment was the primary source of IFNγ, and culture of T cells and these
BiTEs with plate-bound rMICA showed ligand density-dependent production of IFNγ
from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was 2-fold more IFNγ produced per CD8+ T
cell and 5-fold greater percentage of CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ compared with
CD4+ T cells. In addition, both BiTEs elicited significant antitumor responses
against human metastatic melanoma tumor samples using autologous or healthy donor
T cells. These data demonstrate the robust antitumor activity of these NKG2D
ligand-binding bispecific proteins and support their further development for
clinical use. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(7); 1335-46. ©2017 AACR.
