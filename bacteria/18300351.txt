AIM: To compare the effects of treatment of H pylori-infected individuals with
the effects of treatment of individuals as well as all H pylori-infected family
members.
METHODS: H pylori-positive patients with similar demographic specifications were 
prospectively randomized with respect to treatment, with a triple regimen of
either patients and all H pylori-positive family members living togetherI (group 
I) or patients only (group II). Nine months after treatment, all patients were
assessed for H pylori positivity.
RESULTS: There were 70 H pylori-positive patients in each group; patients in
groups I and II lived with 175 and 190 H pylori-positive relatives, respectively.
Age, sex and H pylori positivity rate were similar in both groups of relatives.
Nine months after 14 d standard triple therapy, H pylori positivity was 7.1% in
group I patients and 38.6% in group II patients [P < 0.01, OR = 8.61 95%
confidence interval (CI): 2.91-22.84].
CONCLUSION: The present results indicate bad environmental hygienic conditions
and close intra-familial relationships are important in H pylori contamination.
These findings indicate all family members of H pylori-positive individuals
should be assessed for H pylori positivity, particularly in developing countries 
where H pylori prevalence is high; they also suggest patients, their spouses and 
all H pylori-positive family members of H pylori-positive individuals should be
treated for H pylori infection.
