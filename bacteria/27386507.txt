Bacteria and archaea dominate the biomass of benthic deep-sea ecosystems at all
latitudes, playing a crucial role in global biogeochemical cycles, but their
macroscale patterns and macroecological drivers are still largely unknown. We
show the results of the most extensive field study conducted so far to
investigate patterns and drivers of the distribution and structure of benthic
prokaryote assemblages from 228 samples collected at latitudes comprising 34°N to
79°N, and from ca. 400- to 5570-m depth. We provide evidence that, in deep-sea
ecosystems, benthic bacterial and archaeal abundances significantly increase from
middle to high latitudes, with patterns more pronounced for archaea, and
particularly for Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota. Our results also reveal that
different microbial components show varying sensitivities to changes in
temperature conditions and food supply. We conclude that climate change will
primarily affect deep-sea benthic archaea, with important consequences on global 
biogeochemical cycles, particularly at high latitudes.
