Starved larvae of Rhodnius prolixus, when challenged with Enterobacter cloacae
B12, had their mortality related to their period of starvation. R. prolixus
larvae fed on plasma alone, compared with insects fed on whole blood, had their
immune reactivity affected as shown by: (i) a significant reduction in the
ability to produce cecropin-like and lysozyme activities in the haemolymph when
inoculated with E. cloacae; (ii) a reduction in numbers of haemocytes and nodule 
formation following challenge with bacteria; (iii) a decreased ability of
plasma-fed insects in destroying their infection caused by inoculation of E.
cloacae cells; and (iv) alpha-ecdysone therapy counteracted the immune depression
in Rhodnius larvae fed on plasma alone. However, unlike other immune reactions,
this set of experiments failed to demonstrate any interference of the plasma
feeding on the prophenoloxidase-activating system, since melanin production was
not reduced when the system was stimulated by the presence of bacteria in the
haemolymph. The significance of these data is discussed in relation to the effect
of diet components and the moulting hormone on the immune reactivity in insects.
