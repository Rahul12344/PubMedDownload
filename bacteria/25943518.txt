Environmental controls of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) degradation 
are poorly understood. We investigated whether microbial MCPA degraders are
stimulated by (maize) litter and whether this process depends on concentrations
of MCPA and litter. In a microcosm experiment, different amounts of litter (0, 10
and 20 g kg(-1)) were added to soils exposed to three levels of the herbicide (0,
5 and 30 mg kg(-1)). The treated soils were incubated at 20 °C for 6 weeks, and
samples were taken after 1, 3 and 6 weeks of incubation. In soils with 5 mg
kg(-1) MCPA, about 50 % of the MCPA was dissipated within 1 week of the
incubation. Almost complete dissipation of the herbicide had occurred by the end 
of the incubation with no differences between the three litter amendments. At the
higher concentration (30 mg kg(-1)), MCPA endured longer in the soil, with only
31 % of the initial amount being removed at the end of the experiment in the
absence of litter. Litter addition greatly increased the dissipation rate with 70
and 80 % of the herbicide being dissipated in the 10 and 20 g kg(-1) litter
treatments, respectively. Signs of toxic effects of MCPA on soil bacteria were
observed from related phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses, while fungi showed
higher tolerance to the increased MCPA levels. The abundance of bacterial tfdA
genes in soil increased with the co-occurrence of litter and high MCPA
concentration, indicating the importance of substrate availability in fostering
MCPA-degrading bacteria and thereby improving the potential for removal of MCPA
in the environment.
