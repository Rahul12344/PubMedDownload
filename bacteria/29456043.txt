BACKGROUND: Colistin-carbapenem combinations are synergistic in vitro against
carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We aimed to test whether combination
therapy improves clinical outcomes for adults with infections caused by
carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria.
METHODS: A randomised controlled superiority trial was done in six hospitals in
Israel, Greece, and Italy. We included adults with bacteraemia,
ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or urosepsis caused
by carbapenem-non-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. Patients were randomly
assigned (1:1) centrally, by computer-generated permuted blocks stratified by
centre, to intravenous colistin (9-million unit loading dose, followed by 4·5
million units twice per day) or colistin with meropenem (2-g prolonged infusion
three times per day). The trial was open-label, with blinded outcome assessment. 
Treatment success was defined as survival, haemodynamic stability, improved or
stable Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, stable or improved ratio of
partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of expired oxygen for patients
with pneumonia, and microbiological cure for patients with bacteraemia. The
primary outcome was clinical failure, defined as not meeting all success criteria
by intention-to-treat analysis, at 14 days after randomisation. This trial is
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01732250, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2016, we randomly assigned 406
patients to the two treatment groups. Most patients had pneumonia or bacteraemia 
(355/406, 87%), and most infections were caused by Acinetobacter baumannii
(312/406, 77%). No significant difference between colistin monotherapy (156/198, 
79%) and combination therapy (152/208, 73%) was observed for clinical failure at 
14 days after randomisation (risk difference -5·7%, 95% CI -13·9 to 2·4; risk
ratio [RR] 0·93, 95% CI 0·83-1·03). Results were similar among patients with A
baumannii infections (RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·87-1·09). Combination therapy increased
the incidence of diarrhoea (56 [27%] vs 32 [16%] patients) and decreased the
incidence of mild renal failure (37 [30%] of 124 vs 25 [20%] of 125 patients at
risk of or with kidney injury).
INTERPRETATION: Combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy. The addition
of meropenem to colistin did not improve clinical failure in severe A baumannii
infections. The trial was unpowered to specifically address other bacteria.
