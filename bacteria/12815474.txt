We evaluated the outcome of 29 patients (age 22-60 years), who received a
CD34+selected related (n=16) or unrelated graft (n=13) with limited T-cell
addback (TCAB) (median 5.9 x 10(4)/kg) following full-intensity conditioning for 
haematological malignancies. In all, 16 patients (55%) had either advanced
disease or previous transplants. The cumulative incidences of grade 2-4 acute
GVHD were 15.4 and 19.2% and that for chronic extensive GVHD were 35 and 37% in
related and unrelated graft recipients, respectively. The strongest predictor of 
nonrelapse mortality and overall survival was the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)
at 30 days; patients with ALC<0.35 x 10(9)/l having an NRM and OS of 59.2 and
24.7%, compared to 10 and 90% in those with a higher ALC. Patients with acute
leukaemia had poorer survival and this was associated with a lower ALC as well.
Thus, TCAB with a CD34+ selected graft resulted in a comparable outcome in both
older and younger patients, but the survival was strongly influenced by early
lymphocyte recovery.
