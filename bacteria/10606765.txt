The enzyme adenosine kinase (AK; EC 2.7.1.20) shows a dependence upon inorganic
phosphate (Pi) for activity. The degree of dependence varies among enzyme sources
and the pH at which the activity is measured. At physiological pH, recombinant AK
from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and AK from beef liver (BL) show higher
affinities for the substrate adenosine (Ado), larger maximum velocities and lower
sensitivities to substrate inhibition in the presence of Pi. At pH 6.2, both BL
and CHO AK exhibit almost complete dependence on the presence of Pi for activity.
The data show that both enzymes exhibit increasing relief from substrate
inhibition upon increasing Pi and the inhibition of BL AK is almost completely
alleviated by the addition of 50 mM Pi. The affinity of CHO AK for Ado increases 
asymptotically from K(m) 6.4 microM to a limit of 0.7 microM upon the addition of
increasing Pi from 1 to 50 mM. The concentration of Ado necessary to invoke
substrate inhibition also increases asymptotically from K(i) 32 microM to a limit
of 69 microM at saturating concentrations of phosphate. In the presence of
increasing amounts of Pi, the maximal velocity of activity increases
hyperbolically. The effect that phosphate exerts on AK may be either to protect
the enzyme from inactivation at high adenosine and H(+) concentrations or to
stabilize substrate binding at the active site.
