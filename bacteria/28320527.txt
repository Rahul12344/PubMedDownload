A strain of Ochrobactrum sp. DDT-2 that was capable of degrading DDT as the sole 
carbon and energy source was isolated and sequenced, and its biodegradation
characteristics and metabolism mechanism were examined. The genome sequence of
the isolate DDT-2 was composed of 4,630,303bp with a GC content of 55.99% and
4454 coding genes. The degradation rate of DDT by the isolate DDT-2 increased
with the increasing substrate concentration (0.1-10mg/l) and temperature
(20-40°C). The degradation half-life of DDT in the presence of the isolate DDT-2 
at pH7.0 was obviously shorter than those at pH5.0 and 9.0. Potential DDT
degradation genes were found in the isolate DDT-2 genome by a BLASTx search
against a DDT degradation genes (DDGs) database. A common biodegradation pathway 
of DDT was proposed based on the combined analysis of genome annotation and mass 
spectrometry. DDT was initially dechlorinated to form DDD and DDE. Then, it was
transformed into DDMU and DDA via dechlorination and carboxylation, and it may
ultimately be mineralized to carbon dioxide. The results suggested that the
isolate DDT-2 could be useful for the bioremediation of DDT and its metabolite
residues.
