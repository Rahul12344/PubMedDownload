CD1 molecules are antigen-presenting glycoproteins primarily found on dendritic
cells (DCs) responsible for lipid antigen presentation to CD1-restricted T cells.
Despite their pivotal role in immunity, little is known about CD1 protein
expression in dogs, notably due to lack of isoform-specific antibodies. The
canine (Canis familiaris) CD1 locus was previously found to contain three
functional CD1A genes: canCD1A2, canCD1A6, and canCD1A8, where two variants of
canCD1A8, canCD1A8.1 and canCD1A8.2, were assumed to be allelic variants.
However, we hypothesized that these rather represented two separate genes.
Sequencing of three overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) spanning 
the entire canine CD1 locus revealed canCD1A8.2 and canCD1A8.1 to be located in
tandem between canCD1A7 and canCD1C, and canCD1A8.1 was consequently renamed
canCD1A9. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused canine CD1 transcripts were
recombinantly expressed in 293T cells. All proteins showed a highly positive GFP 
expression except for canine CD1d and a splice variant of canine CD1a8 lacking
exon 3. Probing with a panel of anti-CD1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) showed that
Ca13.9H11 and Ca9.AG5 only recognized canine CD1a8 and CD1a9 isoforms, and
Fe1.5F4 mAb solely recognized canine CD1a6. Anti-CD1b mAbs recognized the canine 
CD1b protein, but also bound CD1a2, CD1a8, and CD1a9. Interestingly, Ca9.AG5
showed allele specificity based on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located
at position 321. Our findings have refined the structure of the canine CD1 locus 
and available antibody specificity against canine CD1 proteins. These are
important fundamentals for future investigation of the role of canine CD1 in
lipid immunity.
