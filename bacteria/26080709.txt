Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and
macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized 
DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in
clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative
colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites.
Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total
CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including 
CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In 
MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and
CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC,
particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. 
The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease
and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In
contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors 
was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that
ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether
the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal
environment.
