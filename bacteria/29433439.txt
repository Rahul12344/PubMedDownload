BACKGROUND: The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila
proliferates in human alveolar macrophages, resulting in a severe pneumonia
termed Legionnaires' disease. Throughout the course of infection, L. pneumophila 
remains enclosed in a specialized membrane compartment that evades fusion with
lysosomes. The pathogen delivers over 300 effector proteins into the host cell,
altering host pathways in a manner that sets the stage for efficient pathogen
replication. The L. pneumophila effector protein AnkX targets host Rab GTPases
and functions in preventing fusion of the Legionella-containing vacuole with
lysosomes. However, the current understanding of AnkX's interaction with host
proteins and the means through which it exerts its cellular function is limited.
RESULTS: Here, we investigated the protein interaction network of AnkX by using
the nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA), a high-density platform
comprising 10,000 unique human ORFs. This approach facilitated the discovery of
PLEKHN1 as a novel interaction partner of AnkX. We confirmed this interaction
through multiple independent in vitro pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and
cell-based assays. Structured illumination microscopy revealed that endogenous
PLEKHN1 is found in the nucleus and on vesicular compartments, whereas
ectopically produced AnkX co-localized with lipid rafts at the plasma membrane.
In mammalian cells, HaloTag-AnkX co-localized with endogenous PLEKHN1 on
vesicular compartments. A central fragment of AnkX (amino acids 491-809),
containing eight ankyrin repeats, extensively co-localized with endogenous
PLEKHN1, indicating that this region may harbor a new function. Further, we found
that PLEKHN1 associated with multiple proteins involved in the inflammatory
response.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study provides evidence that in addition to Rab
GTPases, the L. pneumophila effector AnkX targets nuclear host proteins and
suggests that AnkX may have novel functions related to manipulating the
inflammatory response.
