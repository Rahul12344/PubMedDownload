(13)C-based metabolic flux analysis is an excellent technique to resolve fluxes
in the central carbon metabolism but costs can be significant when using
specialized tracers. This work presents a framework for cost-effective design of 
(13)C-tracer experiments, illustrated on two different networks. Linear and
non-linear optimal input mixtures are computed for networks for Streptomyces
lividans and a carcinoma cell line. If only glucose tracers are considered as
labeled substrate for a carcinoma cell line or S. lividans, the best parameter
estimation accuracy is obtained by mixtures containing high amounts of 1,2-(13)C2
glucose combined with uniformly labeled glucose. Experimental designs are
evaluated based on a linear (D-criterion) and non-linear approach (S-criterion). 
Both approaches generate almost the same input mixture, however, the linear
approach is favored due to its low computational effort. The high amount of
1,2-(13)C2 glucose in the optimal designs coincides with a high experimental
cost, which is further enhanced when labeling is introduced in glutamine and
aspartate tracers. Multi-objective optimization gives the possibility to assess
experimental quality and cost at the same time and can reveal excellent
compromise experiments. For example, the combination of 100% 1,2-(13)C2 glucose
with 100% position one labeled glutamine and the combination of 100% 1,2-(13)C2
glucose with 100% uniformly labeled glutamine perform equally well for the
carcinoma cell line, but the first mixture offers a decrease in cost of $ 120 per
ml-scale cell culture experiment. We demonstrated the validity of a
multi-objective linear approach to perform optimal experimental designs for the
non-linear problem of (13)C-metabolic flux analysis. Tools and a workflow are
provided to perform multi-objective design. The effortless calculation of the
D-criterion can be exploited to perform high-throughput screening of possible
(13)C-tracers, while the illustrated benefit of multi-objective design should
stimulate its application within the field of (13)C-based metabolic flux
analysis.
