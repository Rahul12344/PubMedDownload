In this report we demonstrate that depletion of the major phospholipid
phosphatidylethanolamine, a single non-bilayer forming phospholipid of
Escherichia coli, significantly reduces the secretion efficiency of alkaline
phosphatase in vivo. Secretion, however, is correlated with the content in
membranes of cardiolipin, which in combination with selected divalent cations has
a strong tendency to adopt a non-bilayer state indicating the possible
involvement of lipid polymorphism in efficient protein secretion. Depletion of
this zwitterionic phospholipid also inhibits expression of the protein controlled
by the endogenous P(PHO) promoter but not the P(BAD) promoter, which is suggested
to be due to the effect of unbalanced phospholipid composition on the
orthophosphate signal transduction system (Pho regulon) through an effect on its 
membrane bound sensor.
