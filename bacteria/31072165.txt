The Mur ligases form a series of consecutive enzymes that participate in the
intracellular steps of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. They therefore
represent interesting targets for antibacterial drug discovery. MurC, D, E and F 
are all ATP-dependent ligases. Accordingly, with the aim being to find multiple
inhibitors of these enzymes, we screened a collection of ATP-competitive kinase
inhibitors, on Escherichia coli MurC, D and F, and identified five promising
scaffolds that inhibited at least two of these ligases. Compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5
are multiple inhibitors of the whole MurC to MurF cascade that act in the
micromolar range (IC50, 32-368 µM). NMR-assisted binding studies and steady-state
kinetics studies performed on aza-stilbene derivative 1 showed, surprisingly,
that it acts as a competitive inhibitor of MurD activity towards D-glutamic acid,
and additionally, that its binding to the D-glutamic acid binding site is
independent of the enzyme closure promoted by ATP.
