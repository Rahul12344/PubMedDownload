Greater expression of TLR2, TLR4, and IL6 due to negative energy balance is
associated with lower expression of HLA-DRA and HLA-A in bovine blood neutrophils
after intramammary mastitis challenge with Streptococcus uberis.

Our objectives were to compare gene expression profiles in blood
polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) during a Streptococcus uberis intramammary
challenge between lactating cows subjected to feed restriction to induce negative
energy balance (NEB; n=5) and cows fed ad libitum to maintain positive energy
balance (PEB; n=5). After 5 days of feed restriction, one rear mammary quarter of
each cow was inoculated with 5,000 cfu of S. uberis. Blood PMN were isolated at
24 h post-inoculation from all cows for mRNA expression via quantitative
polymerase chain reaction for 20 genes associated with immune response and
metabolism. A total of 12 genes were differentially expressed in blood PMN in NEB
versus PEB cows. Upregulated genes by NEB were ALOX5AP, CPNE3, IL1R2, IL6, TLR2, 
TLR4, and THY1, and downregulated genes were HLA-DRA, HLA-A, IRAK1, SOD1, and
TNF. Network analysis revealed that TNF was associated with several of the
affected genes in NEB cows compared with PEB cows. Results showed that 24 h after
intramammary challenge with S. uberis, cows in NEB had altered PMN expression of 
genes involved with immune response. Our data provide new information on
transcriptomic mechanisms associated with NEB and the corresponding inhibition of
immune response in lactating dairy cows.
