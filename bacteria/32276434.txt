The development of new agents against bacteria is an urgent necessity for human
beings. The structured colony of bacterial cells, called the biofilm, is used to 
defend themselves from biocide attacks. For this reason, it is necessary to know 
their structures, develop new agents to eliminate them and to develop new
procedures that allow an early diagnosis, by using biomarkers. Among natural
products, some derivatives of diterpenes with halimane skeleton show
antibacterial activity. Some halimanes have been isolated from marine organisms, 
structurally related with halimanes isolated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
These halimanes are being evaluated as virulence factors and as tuberculosis
biomarkers, this disease being one of the major causes of mortality and
morbidity. In this work, the antibacterial halimanes will be reviewed, with their
structural characteristics, activities, sources and the synthesis known until
now.
