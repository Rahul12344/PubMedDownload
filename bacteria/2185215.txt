The arsenical resistance (ars) operon of the conjugative plasmid R773 encodes an 
ATP-driven anion extrusion pump, conferring bacterial resistance to arsenicals.
The operon contains a regulatory gene, arsR, and three structural genes, arsA,
arsB, and arsC. The hydrophilic ArsA and ArsC proteins are produced in large
amounts, but the hydrophobic ArsB protein, an integral membrane polypeptide, is
synthesized in limited quantities. Northern (RNA-DNA) hybridizations provide
evidence that the inducible operon is regulated at the level of transcription.
The genes were transcribed in the presence of an inducer (arsenite) as a single
polycistronic mRNA with an approximate size of 4.4 kilobases (kb). This
transcript was processed to generate relatively stable mRNA species: one of 2.7
kb, encoding the ArsR and ArsA proteins, and a second of 0.5 kb, encoding the
ArsC protein. Segmental differences in stability within the polycistronic
transcript are proposed to account for the differential expression of the ars
genes. In addition, analysis of the mRNA structure at the 5' end of arsB suggests
a potential translational block to the synthesis of this membrane protein.
