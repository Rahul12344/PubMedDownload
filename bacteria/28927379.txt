BACKGROUND: Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a universal signal molecule and enables an
individual bacteria to communicate with each other and ultimately control
behaviors of the population. Harnessing the character of AI-2, two kinds of AI-2 
"controller cells" ("consumer cells" and "supplier cells") were designed to
"reprogram" the behaviors of entire population.
RESULTS: For the consumer cells, genes associated with the uptake and processing 
of AI-2, which includes LsrACDB, LsrFG, LsrK, were overexpressed in varying
combinations. Four consumer cell strains were constructed: Escherichia coli
MG1655 pLsrACDB (NK-C1), MG1655 pLsrACDBK (NK-C2), MG1655 pLsrACDBFG (NK-C3) and 
MG1655 pLsrACDBFGK (NK-C4). The key enzymes responsible for production of AI-2,
LuxS and Mtn, were also overexpressed, yielding strains MG1655 pLuxS (NK-SU1),
and MG1655 pLuxS-Mtn (NK-SU2). All the consumer cells could decrease the
environmental AI-2 concentration. NK-C2 and NK-C4 were most effective in AI-2
uptake and inhibited biofilm formation. While suppliers can increase the
environmental AI-2 concentration and NK-SU2 was most effective in supplying AI-2 
and facilitated biofilm formation. Further, reporter strain, MG1655 pLGFP was
constructed. The expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in reporter cells 
was initiated and guided by AI-2. Mixture of consumer cells and reporter cells
suggest that consumer cells can decrease the AI-2 concentration. And the supplier
cells were co-cultured with reporter cells, indicating that supplier cells can
provide more AI-2 compared to the control.
CONCLUSIONS: The consumer cells and supplier cells could be used to regulate
environmental AI-2 concentration and the biofilm formation. They can also
modulate the AI-2 concentration when they were co-cultured with reporter cells.
It can be envisioned that this system will become useful tools in synthetic
biology and researching new antimicrobials.
