Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of joint failure, yet the underlying
mechanisms remain elusive, and no approved therapies that slow progression exist.
Dysregulated integrin function was previously implicated in OA pathogenesis.
However, the roles of integrin αVβ3 and the integrin-associated receptor CD47 in 
OA remain largely unknown. Here, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of human
and murine osteoarthritic tissues revealed dysregulated expression of αVβ3, CD47,
and their ligands. Using genetically deficient mice and pharmacologic inhibitors,
we showed that αVβ3, CD47, and the downstream signaling molecules Fyn and FAK are
crucial to OA pathogenesis. MicroPET/CT imaging of a mouse model showed elevated 
ligand-binding capacities of integrin αVβ3 and CD47 in osteoarthritic joints.
Further, our in vitro studies demonstrated that chondrocyte breakdown products,
derived from articular cartilage of individuals with OA, induced
αVβ3/CD47-dependent expression of inflammatory and degradative mediators, and
revealed the downstream signaling network. Our findings identify a central role
for dysregulated αVβ3 and CD47 signaling in OA pathogenesis and suggest that
activation of αVβ3 and CD47 signaling in many articular cell types contributes to
inflammation and joint destruction in OA. Thus, the data presented here provide a
rationale for targeting αVβ3, CD47, and their signaling pathways as a
disease-modifying therapy.
