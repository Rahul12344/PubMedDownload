A PCR-based method was developed to identify and detect Flavobacterium
psychrophilum, the causative agent of "cold-water disease" and "rainbow trout fry
syndrome" in salmonid fish. Two oligonucleotide primers were designed by
comparing the 16S rRNA sequence of all taxa in the genus Flavobacterium and of
representative species in most related genera within rRNA superfamily V. Purified
chromosomal DNAs from all these bacterial species, from 25 F. psychrophilum
isolates and from several other fish-pathogenic bacteria were used to assess the 
specificity of the reaction. Amplification products were generated only with F.
psychrophilum DNA. The detection level, equivalent to approximately 10 to 100
bacterial cells, was increased 10-fold by hybridization with a radioactive probe.
Preliminary experiments demonstrated that this procedure can also be applied to
samples of infected tissue. This PCR assay is therefore a rapid, specific, and
sensitive alternative to conventional plate culture methods for the
identification and detection of F. psychrophilum.
