A major outbreak of whooping cough, or pertussis, occurred in 2012 in the United 
Kingdom (UK), with nearly 10 000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 14 infant deaths 
attributed to pertussis. A worldwide resurgence of pertussis has been linked to
switch to the use of acellular pertussis vaccines and the evolution of Bordetella
pertussis away from vaccine-mediated immunity. We have conducted genomic analyses
of multiple strains from the UK outbreak. We show that the UK outbreak was
polyclonal in nature, caused by multiple distinct but closely related strains.
Importantly, we demonstrate that acellular vaccine antigen-encoding genes are
evolving at higher rates than other surface protein-encoding genes. This was true
even prior to the introduction of pertussis vaccines but has become more
pronounced since the introduction of the current acellular vaccines. The fast
evolution of vaccine antigen-encoding genes has serious consequences for the
ability of current vaccines to continue to control pertussis.
