Sepsis is a clinical syndrome caused by a deregulated host response to an
infection. Sepsis is the most frequent cause of death in hospitalized patients.
Although knowledge of the pathogenesis of sepsis has increased substantially
during the last decades, attempts to design effective and specific therapies
targeting components of the derailed host response have failed. Therefore, there 
is a dramatic need for new and mechanistically alternative therapies to treat
this syndrome. Based on their immunomodulatory properties, adult mesenchymal stem
or stromal cells (MSCs) can be a novel therapeutic tool to treat sepsis. Indeed, 
MSCs reduce mortality in experimental models of sepsis by modulating the
deregulated inflammatory response against bacteria through the regulation of
multiple inflammatory networks, the reprogramming of macrophages and neutrophils 
towards a more anti-inflammatory phenotype and the release of anti-microbial
peptides. This report will review the current knowledge on the effects of MSC
treatment in preclinical experimental small animal models of sepsis.
