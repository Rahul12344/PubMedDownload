The quorum quenching (QQ) potential of three pentacyclic triterpenoids,
glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA),
representing distinct groups of compounds, was evaluated. Violacein production by
Chromobacterium violaceum and pyocyanin production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
severely affected by GRA, UA and BA, suggesting a perturbation of N-acyl
homoserine lactone (ASL) based signaling. Molecular docking analysis revealed a
possible interaction between ASL-synthase and ASL-dependent transcriptional
activator homologs from P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with common
binding pockets for GRA, UA and BA. The triterpenoids inhibited biofilm formation
by A. baumannii and affected the overall structure of biofilms. When administered
in combination, two of the three molecules fostered antibiotic action against A. 
baumannii biofilms, widening the scope for developing novel combinations against 
the pathogen.
