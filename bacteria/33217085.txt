Eukaryotic genes can be classified into intronless (no introns), intron-poor
(three or fewer introns per gene) or intron-rich. Early eukaryotic genes were
mostly intron-rich, and their alternative splicing into multiple transcripts,
giving rise to different proteins, might have played pivotal roles in adaptation 
and evolution. Interestingly, extant plant genomes contain many gene families
with one or sometimes few sub-families with genes that are intron-poor or
intronless, and it remains unknown when and how these intron-poor or intronless
genes have originated and evolved, and what their possible functions are. In this
study, we identified 33 such gene families that contained intronless and
intron-poor sub-families. Intronless genes seemed to have first emerged in early 
land plant evolution, while intron-poor sub-families seemed first to have
appeared in green algae. In contrast to intron-rich genes, intronless genes in
intron-poor sub-families occurred later, and were subject to stronger functional 
constraints. Based on RNA-seq analyses in Arabidopsis and rice, intronless or
intron-poor genes in AP2, EF-hand_7, bZIP, FAD_binding_4, STE_STE11,
CAMK_CAMKL-CHK1 and C2 gene families were more likely to play a role in response 
to drought and salt stress, compared with intron-rich genes in the same gene
families, whereas intronless genes in the B_lectin and S_locus_glycop gene family
were more likely to participate in epigenetic processes and plant development.
Understanding the origin and evolutionary trajectory, as well as the potential
functions, of intronless and intron-poor sub-families provides further insight
into plant genome evolution and the functional divergence of genes.
