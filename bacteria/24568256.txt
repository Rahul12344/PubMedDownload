A series of macrocyclic bis-β-lactams has been synthesized in three good yielding
steps using a Staudinger [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of ketene derived from
phenoxyacetyl chloride as the key step. The reaction provided a diastereomeric
mixture of cis-anti-cis (C2-symmetry) and cis-syn-cis (meso) bis-β-lactam grafted
macrocycles which were screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal
activities against four human pathogenic bacteria and two pathogenic fungi.
Compounds 6a and 6b exhibited antibacterial activity at lower concentration
against four bacterial pathogens and compounds 10b and 12a showed antifungal
activity against two fungal pathogens when compared to reference control.
