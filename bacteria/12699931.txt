Ninety-three wild-type isolates identified as actinomycetes were tested against
11 organochlorine pesticides (OPs): aldrin, chlordane, DDD, DDE, DDT, dieldrin,
heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxides, lindane, and methoxychlor. Qualitative
screening agar assays displayed 62-78% tolerance of strains to OPs. Four strains 
designed M4, M7, M9 and M15 were selected based on multi-OP-tolerance, and
identified as members of the streptomycetes group. Different growth profiles were
observed in cultures of the four selected streptomycetes cultured in synthetic
medium containing 5-50 microg x l(-1) aldrin or chlordane or lindane. Increase of
aldrin removal by the selected microorganisms was concomitant with the 4.8-36.0
microg x l(-1) pesticide concentration range. After 72 h of streptomycete M7
growth in synthetic medium containing 48.0 microg x l(-1) aldrin, the remaining
OP concentration in the supernatant was approximately 10% of the initial
concentration. Also, in stationary growth phase less than 2.5 microg x l(-1)
aldrin residual concentration was detected in the medium.
