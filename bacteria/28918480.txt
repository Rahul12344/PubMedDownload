DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) is employed by eukaryotes to deal with replication
blocks on the template strand, and is divided into two parallel pathways that are
activated by sequential ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) at the Lys164 residue. Rad6-Rad18-mediated PCNA monoubiquitination
promotes translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and the monoubiquitinated PCNA can be
further polyubiquitinated by an Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5 complex, leading to error-free
lesion bypass. We previously reported that the DNA helicase Sgs1 is required for 
error-free lesion bypass, probably through the double-Holliday junction migration
and subsequent resolution. Surprisingly, a synthetic genetic array (SGA) screen
using rev1 and rev3 as baits did not reveal an anticipated synthetic effect with 
sgs1, indicating a possible involvement of Sgs1 in TLS. Here, we report detailed 
genetic analyses demonstrating that Sgs1 plays a key role in efficient TLS and
that it is probably required for the signaling of DNA damage leading to PCNA
monoubiquitination. These studies collectively illustrate that Sgs1 participates 
in both branches of DDT and possibly plays a role in pathway choice.
