CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells (NKT cells) possess a wide range of
effector and regulatory activities that are related to their ability to secrete
both T helper 1 (Th1) cell- and Th2 cell-type cytokines. We analyzed presentation
of NKT cell activating alpha galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer) analogs that give
predominantly Th2 cell-type cytokine responses to determine how ligand structure 
controls the outcome of NKT cell activation. Using a monoclonal antibody specific
for alphaGalCer-CD1d complexes to visualize and quantitate glycolipid
presentation, we found that Th2 cell-type cytokine-biasing ligands were
characterized by rapid and direct loading of cell-surface CD1d proteins.
Complexes formed by association of these Th2 cell-type cytokine-biasing
alphaGalCer analogs with CD1d showed a distinctive exclusion from
ganglioside-enriched, detergent-resistant plasma membrane microdomains of
antigen-presenting cells. These findings help to explain how subtle alterations
in glycolipid ligand structure can control the balance of proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory activities of NKT cells.
