BACKGROUND: The presence of bacteremia during a pneumococcal pneumonia is a sign 
of bad prognosis.
AIM: To report a clinical experience with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data from 45 adults
(36 male, aged 17 to 97 years) with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, hospitalized between January 1997 and August
2002 at the Puerto Montt Hospital (Southern Chile).
RESULTS: Eighty four percent of patients bad underlying aggravating conditions,
mainly alcoholism (40%), chronic obstructive lung disease (17.8%) and renal
failure (17.8%). Seven percent were homeless. Fever, cough, dyspnea and sputum
were the most common presenting symptoms. Five patients had pleural involvement. 
Four strains (8.9%) of S. pneumoniae had diminished susceptibility to penicillin.
Nine patients died (case-fatality rate of 20%), but mortality was attributed to
pneumonia in only three of them. Main factors associated with a higher mortality 
were renal failure, absence of cough, an arterial pH < 7.3 on admission, ICU
hospitalization, shock, mechanical ventilation and an APACHE score > 16.
CONCLUSIONS: The high death rate of these patients could be explained mainly by
underlying conditions. ICU management and higher cost preventive measures could
reduce this rate.
