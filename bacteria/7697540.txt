A comprehensive peripheral blood immunophenotype analysis of 16 multiple
sclerosis (MS) patients was performed by three-color flow cytometric analysis,
and the results were compared with those for age-matched healthy controls. The
cell subsets quantified included T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), NK cells
(CD56+), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic (CD28+) and suppressor precursor
(CD28-) CD8+ T cells, CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), and CD5+ T and
B cells. Analysis of MS patients' peripheral blood revealed essentially normal
levels of total T, B, and NK cells. In agreement with results obtained by other
investigators, it was found that MS patients had an increased CD4/CD8 ratio,
primarily due to a decrease in CD8+ T cells. MS patients were found to have a
significantly decreased level of suppressor precursor (CD28-) CD8+ T cells
compared with that of controls but to have normal levels of cytotoxic (CD28+)
CD8+ T cells. These data indicate that MS patients do not have a general decrease
in CD8+ T cells but that they have a specific decrease in the suppressor
precursor subset only and normal levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. MS patients
also had a significant increase in memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ T cells and displayed a 
trend towards a decrease in naive (CD45RA+) T cells in the peripheral blood.
