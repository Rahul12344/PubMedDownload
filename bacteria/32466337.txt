(+)-Bornyl p-coumarate is an active substance that is abundant in the Piper betle
stem and has been shown to possess bioactivity against bacteria and a strong
antioxidative effect. In the current study, we examined the actions of (+)-bornyl
p-coumarate against A2058 and A375 melanoma cells. The inhibition effects of
(+)-bornyl p-coumarate on these cell lines were assessed by
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the
underlying mechanisms were identified by immunostaining, flow cytometry and
western blotting of proteins associated with apoptosis and autophagy. Our results
demonstrated that (+)-bornyl p-coumarate inhibited melanoma cell proliferation
and caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, demonstrating treatment
induced apoptosis. In addition, western blotting revealed that the process is
mediated by caspase-dependent pathways, release of cytochrome C, activation of
pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad and caspase-3/-9) and suppression of
anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1). Also, the upregulated
expressions of p-PERK, p-eIF2Î±, ATF4 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
(C/EBP)-homologous protein (CHOP) after treatment indicated that (+)-bornyl
p-coumarate caused apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Moreover,
increased expressions of beclin-1, Atg3, Atg5, p62, LC3-I and LC3-II proteins and
suppression by autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), indicated that
(+)-bornyl p-coumarate triggered autophagy in the melanoma cells. In conclusion, 
our findings demonstrated that (+)-bornyl p-coumarate suppressed human melanoma
cell growth and should be further investigated with regards to its potential use 
as a chemotherapy drug for the treatment of human melanoma.
