A bacterial strain designated SBNa008(T) was isolated from a Philippine soil
sample. It exhibited the general characteristics associated with myxobacteria,
such as swarming of Gram-negative vegetative rod cells, fruiting body and
myxospore formation and predatory behaviour in lysing micro-organisms. The novel 
strain was characterized as mesophilic, chemoheterotrophic and aerobic. The major
fatty acids were C(20:4)ω6,9,12,15 all cis (arachidonic acid), iso-C(15 : 0),
C(17 : 1) 2-OH and iso-C(15 : 0) dimethylacetal. Interestingly, SBNa008(T)
contained diverse fatty acids belonging to the commercially valuable
polyunsaturated omega-6 and omega-3 families, and a highly conjugated
dihydroxylated C28 steroid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 67.3 mol%. The
16S rRNA gene sequence revealed 95-96% similarity to sequences derived from
clones of uncultured bacteria and 94-95% similarity to cultured members of the
suborder Sorangiineae. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain SBNa008(T)
formed a novel lineage in the suborder Sorangiineae. Based on a polyphasic
taxonomic characterization, we propose that strain SBNa008(T) represents a novel 
genus and species, Minicystis rosea gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of
Minicystis rosea is SBNa008(T) ( =DSM 24000(T) =NCCB 100349(T)).
