Human beta defensin 2 (HBD2) is an endogenous mucosal antimicrobial peptide (AMP)
upregulated during infection and inflammation. HBD2 is encoded by the DEFB4 gene,
which exhibits extensive copy number variation. Previous studies have
demonstrated a relationship between HBD copy number and serum HBD2 protein
levels; however, our current understanding of the influence of copy number on
mucosal AMP function remains limited. This study explores the relationship
between HBD copy number, cervicovaginal HBD2 protein levels and antimicrobial
activity in 203 women with risk factors for preterm birth. We provide evidence
that suggests HBD copy number modulates cervical antimicrobial immunity.
