Reports of the development of antimicrobial resistance by Bordetella pertussis to
macrolides in the United States and Taiwan, together with a recent increase in
pertussis notifications and laboratory-confirmed cases in England and Wales in
2008, prompted the examination of historical and recent clinical isolates from
patients for evidence of such resistance in our collection. Isolates submitted to
our laboratory as part of the enhanced surveillance scheme for pertussis, from
2001 to 2009, were tested against three agents, erythromycin, clarithromycin and 
azithromycin, by the Etest (bioMÃ©rieux) method. All isolates (n = 583) were fully
susceptible to all three agents tested (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 
<or=0.125 microg/ml). All but one strain (582/583) had MICs of <or=0.064 for all 
three agents. The control strain of B. pertussis A228 (from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Atlanta, Georgia, USA) with a resistant
phenotype had an MIC of >256 microg/ml. Although no evidence of resistance was
found in the strains tested from the United Kingdom, screening for antimicrobial 
resistance of B. pertussis may be warranted in cases that are unresponsive to
macrolide treatment and to provide early warning of such emergence in the future.
