We performed molecular characterization of the RpoD1 protein encoded by the rpoD1
gene isolated from a cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa K-81. The deduced
amino acid sequence (416 aa, 48,871 Da) of RpoD1 exhibited extensive similarity
to those of proteins of the eubacterial RpoD family (Escherichia coli sigma 70
homologs). We overproduced and purified RpoD1 (54 kDa) from E. coli. Biological
and biochemical analyses suggested that RpoD1 has a function homologous to that
of E. coli sigma 70 as follows: (i) the RpoD1 protein complemented an rpoD mutant
of E. coli strain YN543 (rpoD285) and (ii) the heterologous RNA polymerase
holoenzyme reconstituted from the E. coli core enzyme and recombinant RpoD1 was
specifically transcribed from E. coli promoters. Furthermore, Western blot
analysis with antiserum against Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 RpoD1 (a
principal sigma factor of the sigma 70 type) indicated that M. aeruginosa K-81
RpoD1 (sigma A1) is the principal sigma factor, which is a major component of the
sigma subunit on exponential cell growth.
