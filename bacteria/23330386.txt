Methanol dehydrogenase (MDG) of the facultative methylotrophic phytosymbiont
Methylobacterium nodulans has been purified for the first time to an
electrophoretically homogeneous state and characterized. The native protein with 
a molecular mass of 70 kDa consists of large (60 kDa) and small (6 kDa) subunits.
The purified protein displayed a specter identical to that of pyrochinolinchinon 
(PCC)-containing MDGs (pI 8.7, pH optimum in the range 9-10). The enzyme was
inactive in the absence of ammonium or methylamine and exhibited a wide substrate
specificity with regard to C1-C2 alcohols with the highest affinity to methanol
(K(M) = 70 mM), but it did not oxidize benzyl and secondary alcohols. The
apparent values of K(M) to primary alcohols increased with the length of the
carbonic chain. The enzyme was characterized by a high stability level even in
the absence of a substrate. An immobilized enzyme was used for amperometric
methanol detection.
