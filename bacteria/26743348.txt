Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may concur to endogenous vascular repair.
Previous studies have reported that statin treatment increases EPC levels. We
investigated whether this occurs in patients on long-term statin treatment who
underwent percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). In a phase A study, 53
patients (atorvastatin reload [AR] 80 mg 12 hours before + 40 mg 2 hours before
PCI, n = 27; placebo [P], n = 26) were evaluated for EPC mobilization as
CD45dim/CD34+/CD133+/KDR+ cell number by flow cytometry. Assays were run at
randomization (12 hours before PCI, R), immediately before PCI (T0) at 8 (T8) and
24 hours (T24). In phase B study, 50 patients (AR, n = 25; P, n = 25) were
evaluated for early colony formation by Hill colony forming unit (CFU) assay,
with sampling at randomization and 24 hours later. In phase A, EPCs levels were
similar at randomization between 2 arms (0.23% [0.14 to 0.54] of total events in 
AR vs 0.22% [0.04 to 0.37] in P group; p = 0.33). At PCI, EPC levels were higher 
in AR arm (0.42% [0.06 to 0.30] vs 0.19% [0.06 to 030]; p = 0.009). Higher EPC
levels in AR group were also found at 8 and 24 hours. In phase B, EPC CFUs/well
numbers at randomization were similar in the 2 arms (8 [6 to 12] in AR vs 12 [6
to 20] in P group, p = 0.109). EPC CFU/well at 24 hours became significantly
higher in AR arm (17 [10 to 23] vs 5 [2 to 13], p = 0.002). In conclusion,
high-dose AR before PCI in patients on long-term statin therapy promptly
increases EPCs mobilization, which are capable of early colony formation and may 
contribute to cardioprotection.
