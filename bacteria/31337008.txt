Mitochondrial complex I-the largest enzyme complex of the mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation machinery-has been proposed to contribute to a variety of
age-related pathological alterations as well as longevity. The enzyme
complex-consisting proteins are encoded by both nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA). While some association studies of mtDNA encoded complex I genes and 
lifespan in humans have been reported, experimental evidence and the functional
consequence of such variants is limited to studies using invertebrate models.
Here, we present experimental evidence that a homoplasmic mutation in the
mitochondrially encoded complex I gene mt-Nd2 modulates lifespan by altering
cellular tryptophan levels and, consequently, ageing-related pathways in mice. A 
conplastic mouse strain carrying a mutation at m.4738C > A in mt-Nd2 lived
slightly, but significantly, shorter than the controls did. The same mutation led
to a higher susceptibility to glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet
feeding. These phenotypes were not observed in mice carrying a mutation in
another mtDNA encoded complex I gene, mt-Nd5, suggesting the functional relevance
of particular mutations in complex I to ageing and age-related diseases.
