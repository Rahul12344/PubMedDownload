A study on the distribution of symptomless mastitis in cows on its forms and
onthe percentage involvement of the individual microorganisms isolated in the
positively reacting cases was carried out including clinical, cytological and
microbiological investigations. The study covered 8 cow farms with a total number
of 2377 cows. It was established that 68.42% of the cows suffer from symptomless 
mastitis and 24.09% of the udder quarters. In 32.39% of the latter cases
non-specific mastitis or the so called secretory disturbance was observed, while 
in 67.61%--bacterial mastitis, which in 50.75% had a subclinical course, while in
17.36--as latent infection. In the samples with pathogenic microorganisms 72.35% 
had staphylococci, 14.32%--micrococci, 8.39%--streptococci and the remaining
4.94%--other kinds of bacteria. The appearance and distribution of symptomless
mastitis in cows is the result of bad management of cow rearing and use.
