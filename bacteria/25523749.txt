OBJECTIVE: Candida albicans-associated denture stomatitis is the most common type
of denture stomatitis seen in denture wearers. This study evaluates and compares 
the antifungal action of fluconazole, chlorhexidine gluconate and tea tree oil on
heat-polymerised denture base resin, which has been previously contaminated with 
C. albicans grown in BHI broth.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-five specimens were immersed in BHI broth
previously inoculated with C. albicans and stored for 3 h at 37°C. They were
divided into five groups (n = 15): G1: 2% chlorhexidine solution; G2: 100% pure
pharmaceutical grade tea tree oil; G3: 65 μg/ml fluconazole solution; C1:
specimens not disinfected; C2: specimens not contaminated with Candida. Each
specimen was then transferred to individual tubes containing BHI broth and
incubated for 24 h. Culture media turbidity was evaluated for absorbance over a
period of 14 days using a microplate reader. It was observed that the lower the
absorbance, the stronger the antimicrobial action. Statistical analysis was
performed (two-way anova and Bonferroni test, p < 0.001).
RESULTS: Chlorhexidine and tea tree oil inhibited Candida up to the 14th day,
whereas antifungal effect of fluconazole was not significant after the 7th day.
CONCLUSION: Tea tree oil and chlorhexidine gluconate are more effective than
fluconazole in inhibiting C. albicans growth on heat-polymerised acrylic resin.
