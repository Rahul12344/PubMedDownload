Acute supraglottitis is a medical emergency as it can rapidly lead to airway
compromise. With routine pediatric immunization for Hemophilus influenzae
serotype b, supraglottitis is now more prevalent in adults, with a shift in the
causative organisms and a change in the natural history of this disease. Here, we
present a case of supraglottitis due to group B streptococcus that occurred in an
adult with previously undetected immunoglobulin 4 (IgG4) and complement protein
C2 deficiency.
