Infective keratitis in soft contact lens wearers.

Cooper RL, Constable IJ.

Eight cases of infective keratitis are reported in wearers of soft contact
lenses. Four of them had normal eyes and were wearing lenses on a continual
basis. One was wearing a lens continually for therapeutic reasons. Three others
were wearing lenses daily or intermittently. The four latter cases were using
contaminated lens solutions. Two of the continual lens wearers lost vision to the
point of blindness. A significant factor in their bad outcome was the fact that
both lived in areas remote from adequate ophthalmic services. Serratia
liquefaciens was implicated in one case. This is thought to be the only reported 
case of corneal abscess due to this organism in the past 16 years. S. marcescens 
was grown in another case from the lens solutions and carrying case.
