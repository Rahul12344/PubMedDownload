One of the biggest challenges for recent medical research is the continuous
development of new antibiotics interacting with bacterial essential mechanisms.
The machinery for peptidoglycan biosynthesis is a rich source of crucial targets 
for antibacterial chemotherapy. The cytoplasmic steps of the biosynthesis of
peptidoglycan precursor, catalysed by a series of Mur enzymes, are excellent
candidates for drug development. There has been growing interest in these
bacterial enzymes over the last decade. Many studies attempted to understand the 
detailed mechanisms and structural features of the key enzymes MurA to MurF. Only
MurA is inhibited by a known antibiotic, fosfomycin. Several attempts made to
develop novel inhibitors of this pathway are discussed in this review. Three
novel inhibitors of MurA were identified recently. 4-Thiazolidinone compounds
were designed as MurB inhibitors. Many phosphinic acid derivatives and substrate 
analogues were identified as inhibitors of the MurC to MurF amino acid ligases.
