Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that is increasingly resistant to
clinically useful antimicrobial agents. While screening for S. aureus genes
expressed during mammalian infection, we isolated murC. This gene encodes
UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine synthetase, an enzyme essential for cell wall
biosynthesis in a number of bacteria. S. aureus MurC has a predicted mass 49,182 
Da and complements the temperature-sensitive murC mutation of E. coli ST222.
Sequence data on the DNA flanking staphylococcal murC suggests that the local
gene organization there parallels that found in B. subtilis, but differs from
that found in gram-negative bacterial pathogens. MurC proteins represent
promising targets for broad spectrum antimicrobial drug development.
