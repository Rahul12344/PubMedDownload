Arsenic (As) contaminated soils are enriched with arsenotrophic bacteria. The
present study analyzes the microbiome and arsenotrophic genes-from As affected
soil samples of Bhanga, Charvadrason and Sadarpur of Faridpur district in
Bangladesh in summer (SFDSL1, 2, 3) and in winter (WFDSL1, 2, 3). Total As
content of the soils was within the range of 3.24-17.8 mg/kg as per atomic
absorption spectroscopy. The aioA gene, conferring arsenite [As (III)] oxidation,
was retrieved from the soil sample, WFDSL-2, reported with As concentration of
4.9 mg/kg. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the aioA genes of soil WFDSL-2
were distributed among four major phylogenetic lineages comprised of α, β, γ
Proteobacteria and Archaea with a dominance of β Proteobacteria (56.67 %). An
attempt to enrich As (III) metabolizing bacteria resulted 53 isolates. ARDRA
(amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis) followed by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing of the 53 soil isolates revealed that they belong to six genera;
Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Brevibacillus spp., Delftia spp.,
Wohlfahrtiimonas spp. and Dietzia spp. From five different genera, isolates
Delftia sp. A2i, Pseudomonas sp. A3i, W. chitiniclastica H3f, Dietzia sp. H2f,
Bacillus sp. H2k contained arsB gene and showed arsenite tolerance up-to 27 mM.
Phenotypic As (III) oxidation potential was also confirmed with the isolates of
each genus and isolate Brevibacillus sp. A1a showed significant As (III)
transforming potential of 0.2425 mM per hour. The genetic information of
bacterial arsenotrophy and arsenite oxidation added scientific information about 
the possible bioremediation potential of the soil isolates in Bangladesh.
