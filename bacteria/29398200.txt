DNA sequence-based typing at the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1,
-DRB1, and -DRB3/4/5 loci was performed on samples provided by 159 individuals
from the Worcester region of the Western Cape province of South Africa. The
purpose of the study was to characterize allele frequencies in the local
population, to support studies of T cell immunity against pathogens, including
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There are no detectable deviations from Hardy
Weinberg proportions for the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, and -DRB1 loci. 
A minor deviation was detected at the HLA-DQB1 locus due to an excess of
homozygotes. The genotype data are available in the Allele Frequencies Net
Database under identifier 3425.
