Nanog expression is heterogeneous and dynamic in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
However, the mechanism for stabilizing pluripotency during the transitions
between Nanog(high) and Nanog(low) states is not well understood. Here we report 
that Dax1 acts in parallel with Nanog to regulate mouse ESC (mESCs) identity.
Dax1 stable knockdown mESCs are predisposed towards differentiation but do not
lose pluripotency, whereas Dax1 overexpression supports LIF-independent
self-renewal. Although partially complementary, Dax1 and Nanog function
independently and cannot replace one another. They are both required for full
reprogramming to induce pluripotency. Importantly, Dax1 is indispensable for
self-renewal of Nanog(low) mESCs. Moreover, we report that Dax1 prevents
extra-embryonic endoderm (ExEn) commitment by directly repressing Gata6
transcription. Dax1 may also mediate inhibition of trophectoderm differentiation 
independent or as a downstream effector of Oct4. These findings establish a basal
role of Dax1 in maintaining pluripotency during the state transition of mESCs and
somatic cell reprogramming.
