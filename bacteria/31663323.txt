Targeting Streptococcus mutans is the primary focus in reducing dental caries,
one of the most common maladies in the world. Previously, our groups discovered a
potent bactericidal biaryl compound that was inspired by the natural product
honokiol. Herein, a structure activity relationship (SAR) study to ascertain
structural motifs key to inhibition is outlined. Furthermore, mechanism studies
show that bacterial membrane disruption is central to the bacterial growth
inhibition. During this process, it was discovered that analog C2 demonstrated a 
4-fold better therapeutic index compared to the commercially available
antimicrobial cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) making it a viable alternative for
oral care.
