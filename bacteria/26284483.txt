Shaping natural killer (NK) cell functions in human immunity and reproduction are
diverse killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that recognize
polymorphic MHC class I determinants. A survey of placental mammals suggests that
KIRs serve as variable NK cell receptors only in certain primates and
artiodactyls. Divergence of the functional and variable KIRs in primates and
artiodactyls predates placental reproduction. Among artiodactyls, cattle but not 
pigs have diverse KIRs. Catarrhine (humans, apes, and Old World monkeys) and
platyrrhine (New World monkeys) primates, but not prosimians, have diverse KIRs. 
Platyrrhine and catarrhine systems of KIR and MHC class I are highly diverged,
but within the catarrhines, a stepwise co-evolution of MHC class I and KIR is
discerned. In Old World monkeys, diversification focuses on MHC-A and MHC-B and
their cognate lineage II KIR. With evolution of C1-bearing MHC-C from MHC-B, as
informed by orangutan, the focus changes to MHC-C and its cognate lineage III
KIR. Evolution of C2 from C1 and fixation of MHC-C drove further elaboration of
MHC-C-specific KIR, as exemplified by chimpanzee. In humans, the evolutionary
trajectory changes again. Emerging from reorganization of the KIR locus and
selective attenuation of KIR avidity for MHC class I are the functionally
distinctive KIR A and KIR B haplotypes.
