OBJECTIVE: Human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) is a potent antimicrobial peptide that
is part of the innate immune response. The purpose of this study was to determine
whether HBD-2 is present in amniotic fluid and if its concentration changes with 
microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) and labor.
STUDY DESIGN: Amniotic fluid was retrieved by amniocentesis from 318 patients in 
the following groups: (1) mid-trimester (n=75); (2) term not in labor (n=28) and 
in labor (n=51); (3) preterm labor and intact membranes without MIAC who
delivered at term (n=36), who delivered preterm without MIAC (n=52), and preterm 
labor with MIAC who delivered preterm (n=25); and (4) preterm premature rupture
of membranes (preterm PROM) with (n=25) and without MIAC (n=26). MIAC was defined
as a positive amniotic fluid culture for microorganisms. Amniotic fluid HBD-2
concentrations were determined using a sensitive and specific ELISA.
Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis.
RESULTS: (1) HBD-2 was detected in all amniotic fluid samples; (2) the
concentration of HBD-2 did not change with gestational age from mid-trimester to 
term (p=0.8); (3) intra-amniotic infection was associated with a significant
increase in amniotic fluid concentrations of HBD-2 in both women with preterm
labor and intact membranes, and women with preterm PROM (p<0.05 for each
comparison); (4) patients with preterm labor and a negative amniotic fluid
culture who delivered preterm had a higher median amniotic fluid HBD-2
concentration than those with preterm labor who delivered at term (p=0.001); and 
(5) among patients with preterm labor without MIAC, those who had intra-amniotic 
inflammation (amniotic fluid white blood cell count>100 cells per mL) had a
higher median amniotic fluid concentration of HBD-2 than those without this
condition (p<0.002).
CONCLUSION: (1) Amniotic fluid contains HBD-2, a natural antimicrobial peptide,
and this may account for some of the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid;
(2) amniotic fluid HBD-2 concentrations are increased in women with MIAC,
regardless of the membrane status (intact membranes or PROM); and (3) we propose 
that amniotic fluid HBD-2 is part of the innate immune system within the amniotic
cavity.
