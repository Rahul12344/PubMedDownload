BACKGROUND: The interleukin-10 receptor alpha (IL10RA) gene codes for the alpha
chain of the IL-10 receptor which binds the cytokine IL-10. IL-10 is an
anti-inflammatory cytokine with immunoregulatory function during the pathogenesis
of many inflammatory disorders in livestock, including Johne's disease (JD). JD
is a chronic enteritis in cattle caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (MAP) and is responsible for significant economic losses to the 
dairy industry. Several candidate genes including IL10RA have been found to be
associated with JD. The aim of this study was to better understand the functional
significance of IL10RA in the context of immune stimulation with MAP cell wall
lysate.
RESULTS: An IL10RA knock out (KO) bovine mammary epithelial cell (MAC-T) line was
generated using the CRISPR/cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) gene editing system. These
IL10RA KO cells were stimulated with the immune stimulant MAP lysate +/- IL-10,
or with LPS as a positive control. In comparison to unedited cells, relative
quantification of immune-related genes after stimulation revealed that knocking
out IL10RA resulted in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression 
(TNFA, IL1A, IL1B and IL6) and downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling
3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. At the
protein level knocking out IL10RA also resulted in upregulation of inflammatory
cytokines - TNF-α and IL-6 and chemokines - IL-8, CCL2 and CCL4, relative to
unedited cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study illustrate the broad and significant
effects of knocking out the IL10RA gene in enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokine
expression and further support the immunoregulatory role of IL10RA in eliciting
an anti-inflammatory response as well as its potential functional involvement
during the immune response associated with JD.
