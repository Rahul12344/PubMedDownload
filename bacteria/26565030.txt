Phagocytosis is a critical cellular process for innate immune defense against
microbial infection. The regulation of phagocytosis process is complex and has
not been well defined. An intracellular molecule might regulate cell
surface-initiated phagocytosis, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly 
understood (1). In this study, we found that microtubule-associated protein 1S
(MAP1S), a protein identified recently that is involved in autophagy (2), is
expressed primarily in macrophages. MAP1S-deficient macrophages are impaired in
the phagocytosis of bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAP1S interacts
directly with MyD88, a key adaptor of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), upon TLR
activation and affects the TLR signaling pathway. Intriguingly, we also observe
that, upon TLR activation, MyD88 participates in autophagy processing in a
MAP1S-dependent manner by co-localizing with MAP1 light chain 3 (MAP1-LC3 or
LC3). Therefore, we reveal that an intracellular autophagy-related molecule of
MAP1S controls bacterial phagocytosis through TLR signaling.
