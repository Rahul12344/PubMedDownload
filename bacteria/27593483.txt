We have recently discovered a unique CD34(lo)CD133(lo) cell population in the
human fetal liver (FL) that gives rise to cells in the hepatic lineage. In this
study, we further characterized the biological functions of FL CD34(lo)CD133(lo) 
cells. Our findings show that these CD34(lo)CD133(lo) cells express markers of
both endodermal and mesodermal lineages and have the capability to differentiate 
into hepatocyte and mesenchymal lineage cells by ex vivo differentiation assays. 
Furthermore, we show that CD34(lo)CD133(lo) cells express growth factors that are
important for human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion: stem cell factor
(SCF), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12),
and factors in the angiopoietin-like protein family. Co-culture of autologous FL 
HSCs and allogenic HSCs derived from cord blood with CD34(lo)CD133(lo) cells
supports and expands both types of HSCs.These findings are not only essential for
extending our understanding of the HSC niche during the development of embryonic 
and fetal hematopoiesis but will also potentially benefit adult stem cell
transplantations in clinics because expanded HSCs demonstrate the same capacity
as primary cells to reconstitute the human immune system and mediate long-term
hematopoiesis in vivo. Together, CD34(lo)CD133(lo) cells not only serve as
stem/progenitor cells for liver development but are also an essential component
of the HSC niche in the human FL.
