Cutaneous syncytial myoepithelioma (CSM) is a recently recognized,
histopathological variant of myoepithelial (ME) tumors of the skin. It is
characterized by a syncytial arrangement of spindled, ovoid, and/or epithelioid
cells forming a well-circumscribed, unencapsulated dermal nodule. There is a
paucity of intervening stroma, and absent duct or gland formation. Strong
immunohistochemical staining for S100 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) has
been described, while cytokeratin expression has been uncommon. The majority of
CSMs harbor a rearrangement involving the EWSR1 gene. Although various fusion
partner genes have been discovered in ME tumors at other anatomic sites, none has
yet been described in CSM. We present a case of CSM represented clinically by a
papule on the mid-upper back of a healthy 44-year-old female. It exhibited
morphological and immunohistochemical features of a CSM with strong, diffuse S100
and alpha-actin expression, and focal positivity for EMA and cytokeratin AE1/AE3.
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed an EWSR1 gene rearrangement. Massively 
parallel next-generation RNA sequencing revealed PBX3 as the fusion partner. The 
EWSR1-PBX3 gene fusion has been previously identified in three cases of ME tumors
of bone and soft tissue, and in a case of retroperitoneal leiomyoma. This is the 
first report of an EWSR1-PBX3 fusion in CSM.
