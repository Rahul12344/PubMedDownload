Salmonella are intracellular parasites which enter their hosts by penetrating the
intestinal epithelial barrier. We examined the interaction of S. choleraesuis and
S. typhimurium with Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human larynx (HEp-2)
epithelial cells to characterize bacterial adherence, invasion and penetration
through epithelial monolayers. Epithelial cell microfilaments were required for
bacterial internalization and surrounded the bacteria as they were internalized. 
The bacteria entered membrane-bound vacuoles inside epithelial cells where they
replicated. When polarized MDCK cell monolayers were infected, we found that
Salmonella could pass through this barrier and enter medium bathing the opposite 
surface, although most bacteria remained within the monolayer. Synthesis of
several Salmonella proteins was induced by the presence of epithelial cell
surfaces, and these proteins were required for bacterial adherence and invasion. 
This induction was stimulated by trypsin- and neuraminidase-sensitive structures 
on epithelial cells.
