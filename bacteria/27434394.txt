The critically endangered California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) has relied 
intermittently on dead-stranded marine mammals since the Pleistocene, and this
food source is considered important for their current recovery. However,
contemporary marine mammals contain persistent organic pollutants that could
threaten condor health. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope, contaminant, 
and behavioral data in coastal versus noncoastal condors to quantify contaminant 
transfer from marine mammals and created simulation models to predict the risk of
reproductive impairment for condors from exposure to DDE (p,p'-DDE), a major
metabolite of the chlorinated pesticide DDT. Coastal condors had higher whole
blood isotope values and mean concentrations of contaminants associated with
marine mammals, including mercury (whole blood), sum chlorinated pesticides
(comprised of ∼95% DDE) (plasma), sum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (plasma), 
and sum polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (plasma), 12-100-fold greater than
those of noncoastal condors. The mean plasma DDE concentration for coastal
condors was 500 ± 670 (standard deviation) (n = 22) versus 24 ± 24 (standard
deviation) (n = 8) ng/g of wet weight for noncoastal condors, and simulations
predicted ∼40% of breeding-age coastal condors have DDE levels associated with
eggshell thinning in other avian species. Our analyses demonstrate potentially
harmful levels of marine contaminant transfer to California condors, which could 
hinder the recovery of this terrestrial species.
