OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is an important cause of
chorioamnionitis. This study characterizes GBS colonization and stimulation of
antimicrobial responses in human extraplacental membranes using an ex vivo
transwell two-compartment system of full-thickness membranes and live GBS.
STUDY DESIGN: Human extraplacental membranes were affixed to transwell frames
(without synthetic membranes). Live GBS was added to the decidual side of
membranes in transwell cultures, and cocultures were incubated for 4, 8 and 24 h.
GBS recovery from homogenized membranes and culture medium was determined by
enumerating colony forming units (CFU) on blood agar. Antimicrobial peptide
expression was identified using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. GBS killing by
HBDs was assessed in vitro by incubating GBS with different human beta defensins 
(HBDs) for 3 h, then enumerating CFU.
RESULTS: GBS recovery from membranes markedly decreased over time (P < 0.05). The
antimicrobial peptides HBD-1, HBD-2, HBD-3, and lactoferrin were expressed in
both GBS-exposed and non-exposed tissues. Notably, a pattern of localized
increased HBD-2 in the amnion of GBS-infected tissue was observed. Moreover,
GBS-treated membranes released increased amounts of HBD-2 into the amniotic and
decidual compartments of the transwell cultures after 24 h (P < 0.05). In
bacterial cultures, HBD-2 decreased GBS viability in a concentration-dependent
manner (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Innate immune responses in ex vivo human extraplacental membranes
suppress GBS growth. HBD-2 was implicated in this GBS suppression with evidence
of signal transduction across the tissue. Antimicrobial peptides may be important
for innate immune defense against intrauterine GBS infections during pregnancy.
