Whereas the acquired T cell-mediated protection against intracellular pathogens
such as Leishmania major has been well studied in the past, the cells and
mechanisms involved in their innate control are still poorly understood. Here, we
investigated the role of natural killer T (NKT) cells in a high dose L. major
mouse infection model. In vitro, L. major only weakly stimulated NKT cells and
antagonized their response to the prototypic NKT cell ligand
alpha-galactosylceramide, indicating that L. major partially escapes the
activation of NKT cells. NKT cell deficiency as analyzed by subcutaneous
infection of Jalpha281-/- mice (lacking invariant CD1d-restricted NKT cells) and 
CD1-/- mice (lacking all CD1d-restricted NKT cells) led to a transient increase
in skin lesions, but did not impair the clinical cure of the infection, NK cell
cytotoxicity, the production of IFN-gamma, the expression of inducible nitric
oxide synthase, and the control of the parasites in the lymph node. In the
spleen, however, NKT cells were required for NK cell cytotoxicity and early
IFN-gamma production, they lowered the parasite burden, and exerted bystander
effects on Leishmania antigen-specific T cell responses, most notably after
systemic infection. Thus, NKT cells fulfill organ-specific protective functions
during infection with L. major, but are not essential for parasite control.
