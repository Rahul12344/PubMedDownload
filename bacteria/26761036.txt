The oceans represent an understudied resource for the isolation of bacteria with 
the potential to produce novel secondary metabolites. In particular, actinomyces 
are well known to produce chemically diverse metabolites with a wide range of
biological activities. This study characterised spore-forming bacteria from both 
Scottish and Antarctic sediments to assess the influence of isolation location on
secondary metabolite production. Due to the selective isolation method used, all 
85 isolates belonged to the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, with the
majority of isolates belonging to the genera Bacillus and Streptomyces. Based on 
morphology, thirty-eight isolates were chosen for chemical investigation.
Molecular networking based on chemical profiles (HR-MS/MS) of fermentation
extracts was used to compare complex metabolite extracts. The results revealed
40% and 42% of parent ions were produced by Antarctic and Scottish isolated
bacteria, respectively, and only 8% of networked metabolites were shared between 
these locations, implying a high degree of biogeographic influence upon secondary
metabolite production. The resulting molecular network contained over 3500 parent
ions with a mass range of m/z 149-2558 illustrating the wealth of metabolites
produced. Furthermore, seven fermentation extracts showed bioactivity against
epithelial colon adenocarcinoma cells, demonstrating the potential for the
discovery of novel bioactive compounds from these understudied locations.
