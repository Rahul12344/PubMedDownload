Two different approaches of matrix assisted refolding have been evaluated and
compared to conventional refolding by dilution. Bovine alpha-lactalbumin was used
for the studies as model protein. It was adsorbed under denaturing conditions on 
an ion exchange matrix and refolding was completed on the column prior to elution
or, depending on the buffer system, in the eluate. Agarose based chromatography
matrices showed high capacities for the denatured alpha-lactalbumin. A positive
effect on the yield of refolded protein by the matrix could be observed for
Fractogel EMD DEAE and a negative for Toyopearl DEAE 650M, DEAE Sepharose FF and 
Q Sepharose FF. In the case of Fractogel EMD DEAE the ion exchange surface might 
act as a folding helper. This property may be caused by the grafted polymers. For
Source 30Q only a marginal negative influence on the refolding kinetics was
observed, thus the ion exchanger is only a mean for removal of chaotropic agents.
Refolding on the column is characterized by a low yield but high productivity due
to significant reduction of refolding time.
