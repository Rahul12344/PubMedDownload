PD-1-targeted therapy has dramatically changed advanced cancer treatment.
However, many questions remain, including specificity of T cells activated by
PD-1 therapy and how peripheral blood analysis correlates to effects at tumor
sites. In this study, we utilized TCR sequencing to dissect the composition of
peripheral blood CD8 T cells activated upon therapy, comparing it with
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. We report on a nonagenarian melanoma patient who 
showed a prominent increase in peripheral blood Ki-67 + CD8 T cells following
brain stereotactic radiation and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Proliferating CD8 T
cells exhibited an effector-like phenotype with expression of CD38, HLA-DR and
Granzyme B, as well as expression of the positive costimulatory molecules CD28
and CD27. TCR sequencing of peripheral blood CD8 T cells revealed a highly
oligoclonal repertoire at baseline with one clonotype accounting for 30%.
However, the majority of dominant clones-including a previously identified
cytomegalovirus-reactive clone-did not expand following treatment. In contrast,
expanding clones were present at low frequencies in the peripheral blood but were
enriched in a previously resected liver metastasis. The patient has so far
remained recurrence-free for 36 months, and several CD8 T cell clones that
expanded after treatment were maintained at elevated levels for at least 8
months. Our data show that even in a nonagenarian individual with oligoclonal
expansion of CD8 T cells, we can identify activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T 
cell clones in peripheral blood following anti-PD-1-based immunotherapies.
