The group A rotavirus strain SI-2987/09 was detected in a child with severe
diarrhea. The whole-genome analysis revealed the
G8-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 genome constellation, which reflects the
zoonotic transmission of the strain most probably from the ungulate group. This
was also confirmed by the high nucleotide identity to those animal rotavirus
strains.
