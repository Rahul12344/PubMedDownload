Arsenite [As(III)]-oxidizing bacteria were isolated from heavy metal contaminated
shore of Gulf of Cambay at Alang, India. The most efficient bacterial strain
Alang-4 could tolerate up to 15 mM arsenite [As(III)] and 200 mM of arsenate
[As(V)]. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence was 99% identical to the 16S rRNA genes of
genus Halomonas (Accession no. HQ659187). Arsenite oxidase enzyme localized on
membrane helped in conversion of As(III) to As(V). Arsenite transporter genes
(arsB, acr3(1) and acr3(2)) assisted in extrusion of arsenite from Halomonas sp. 
Alang-4. Generation of ROS in response to arsenite stress was alleviated by
higher activities of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and
glutathione S-transferase enzymes. Down-regulation in the specific activities of 
nearly all dehydrogenases of carbon assimilatory pathway viz.,
glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, Î±-ketoglutarate, isocitrate and malate
dehydrogenases, was observed in presence of As(III), whereas, the specific
activities of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase and
isocitrate lyase enzymes were found to increase two times in As(III) treated
cells. The results suggest that in addition to efficient ars operon, alternative 
pathways of carbon utilization exist in the marine bacterium Halomonas sp.
Alang-4 to overcome the toxic effects of arsenite on its dehydrogenase enzymes.
