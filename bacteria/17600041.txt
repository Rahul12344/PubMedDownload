Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a subset of regulatory T lymphocytes that
recognize glycolipid antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex
class I-related glycoprotein CD1d. NKT cells have been implicated in regulating
the progression of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in human patients and in an animal model
for T1D. In addition, glycolipid agonists of NKT cells have been successful in
preventing diabetes in mice, raising enthusiasm for the development of NKT
cell-based therapies for T1D.
