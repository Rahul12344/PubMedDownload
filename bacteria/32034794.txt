Supplements produced by mouse testicular cells (mTCs) and the interaction between
cells can increase the differentiation rate of human umbilical cord mesenchymal
stem cells (hUCMSCs) into the germ-like cells. We studied the differentiation
rate of hUCMSCs into the germ-like cells under effect of mTCs co-culturing.
Isolated hUCMSCs from postpartum human umbilical cords were cultured. Then, the
expression of mesenchymal (CD73, CD90 and CD105) and haematopoietic (CD34 and
CD45) markers of hUCMSCs were confirmed by flow cytometry. Then, the hUCMSCs were
cultured in four distinct groups: (a) control, (b) co-culture until D0, (c)
co-culture until D5 and (d) co-culture until D10, in order to differentiate into 
the germ-like cells. After 10 days, the expression of OCT4, VASA, Fragilis and
SYCP3 genes were examined by Real-Time qPCR. The flow cytometry indicated a high 
expression of mesenchymal markers and a low expression of haematopoietic markers 
(CD73:98.6%, CD90: 99.1%, CD105: 99.5%, CD34: 4.22% and CD45: 2.54%). The
expression of OCT4 decreased during the time while the expression of VASA,
Fragilis and SYCP3 markers increased in the co-culture with testicular cells (p
value <.05). Co-culture with mTCs may be used as an effective method to
differentiate hUCMSCs into germ-like cells.
