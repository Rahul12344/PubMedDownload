Carbon fixation, in addition to the evolution of metabolism, is a main
requirement for the evolution of life. Here, we report a one-pot carbon fixation 
of acetylene (C2H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) by aqueous nickel sulfide (NiS)
under hydrothermal (>100 °C) conditions. A slurry of precipitated NiS converts
acetylene and carbon monoxide into a set of C2-4-products that are surprisingly
representative for C2-4-segments of all four central CO2-fixation cycles of the
domains Bacteria and Archaea, whereby some of the products engage in the same
interconversions, as seen in the central CO2-fixation cycles. The results suggest
a primordial, chemically predetermined, non-cyclic acetyleno/carboxydotrophic
core metabolism. This metabolism is based on aqueous organo-metal chemistry, from
which the extant central CO2-fixation cycles based on thioester chemistry would
have evolved by piecemeal modifications.
