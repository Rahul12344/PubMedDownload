Isobutyl nitrite is an inhalant abused principally by male homosexuals. We have
reported that subchronic inhalation exposure (45 min/day for 14 days) to 900 ppm 
isobutyl nitrite was immunosuppressive. In the present study, the effects of
acute exposure to the inhalant were examined. Mice were exposed in an inhalation 
chamber to 900 ppm isobutyl nitrite for 45 min. One day later, spleen cellularity
was reduced by 39% without selectively depleting CD4(+) or CD8(+) cells. The
numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes and peritoneal cells were also reduced.
Following acute inhalation exposure, T cell proliferative responses stimulated
with allogeneic cells or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies were inhibited, while 
mitogen-induced responses were not affected. Purified T cells exposed to the
inhalant also had compromised responses, suggesting a direct effect on T cells.
However, the cumulative effects of multiple exposures were necessary to inhibit
T-dependent antibody responses or T cell or macrophage cytotoxicity.
