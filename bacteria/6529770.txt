In vivo study of xibornol on phagocyte functions.

Zanon P, De Rose V, Bersani C, Caritinos P, Mazzocchi P.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML) represent the first step of defense against
bacteria and fungi. Since many antimicrobial drugs have been reported to inhibit 
phagocyte function, we tested the interference of xibornol, a new antimicrobial
agent, on phagocyte functions, in order to evaluate its possible use in chronic
respiratory diseases. In the patients treated with xibornol (500 mg every 8 h for
7 days) we did not find any modification in phagocytosis frequency (PMF),
phagocytosis index (PHI), nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), reduction frequency (NRF),
microbicidal activity and neutrophil mobility of PML, before, during and after
the end of therapy.
