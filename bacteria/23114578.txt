Costimulation and coinhibition generated by the B7 family and their receptor CD28
family have key roles in regulating T lymphocyte activation and tolerance. These 
pathways are very attractive therapeutic targets for human cancers including
breast cancer. Gene polymorphisms of B7x (B7-H4/B7S1), PD-1 (CD279), and CTLA-4
(CD152) are associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer although
the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In human breast cancer microenvironment,
up-regulation of coinhibitory B7/CD28 members B7x, B7-H3 (CD276), and PD-L1
(B7-H1/CD274) on tumor cells as well as PD-1 and PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating
immune cells are emerging as immune evasion pathways. Chemotherapy can affect the
expression of these molecules, and therefore may dampen the immune response
against breast cancer. Immunotherapy targeting T cell coinhibition as monotherapy
or combined with standard therapies are in early stages of clinical development, 
but hold great promise for treatment of human breast cancer.
