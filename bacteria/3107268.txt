Disinfection of hands, skin or mucous membranes or the mere cleansing of hands
have different functions, which should be differentiated clearly. With different 
cleansing methods dirt will be removed, whereas disinfection methods will
eliminate microbial contamination or reduce the resident skin flora. Cleansing of
hands removes only a very limited amount of microorganisms and cannot replace
disinfection. Skin has to be disinfected when the integrity of the body is
harmed. Depending on the tasks which are to be performed, sometimes an immediate 
onset of action and not a long duration of effect can be desirable. In other
cases it is just the prolonged action, even with slow onset, that is required.
Furthermore a long-lasting effect can be useful, when recontamination takes place
later on. Skin disinfectants can be applied by spraying or swabbing. There are
only limited data known over disinfection of mucous membranes and till now there 
exist no suitable test-methods. Experimental studies have shown no really
convincing results, even though sometimes a sufficient disinfection could be seen
in clinical practice. This is partly due to the bacteriostatic effect. The
problematical nature of recontamination of mucous membranes is naturally very
serious, but the adhesion of disinfectants due to the special conditions on
mucous membranes usually rather bad. Which procedures have to be applied in
particular cases has to be decided after weighting the risks against each other.
