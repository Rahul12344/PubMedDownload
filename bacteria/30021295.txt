While metal immobilization had been increasingly reported with biochar soil
amendment (BSA), changes in microbial activity and nitrogen (N) transformation in
metal contaminated croplands following biochar addition had been insufficiently
addressed. In a field experiment, a Pb/Cd contaminated Inceptisol from North
China was amended to topsoil with wheat straw biochar at 0 (CK), 20 (C1) and
40 t ha-1 (C2). The changes within two years following BSA were tested in
microbial biomass and respiration, and in abundance of N transforming microbial
communities and their activities. Corresponding to the results of decreased soil 
extractable Cd and Pb, significant reductions in qCO2 were found in rhizosphere
and bulk soil only under C2 in the first year. The potential nitrification
activity was significantly increased by 20-71%, along with an increase in
ammonium (by 7-21%) and nitrate (by 21%-70%) concentration, with BSA compared to 
CK. Meanwhile, N2O production activity was slightly increased (by up to 20%) but 
N2O reduction activity greatly enhanced (by up to 84%), with a higher ratio of
nosZ/(nirS + nirK), under C2 in rhizosphere in both wheat seasons. Whereas, such 
changes were not remarkable in bulk soil. Moreover, microbial communities were
less respondent to biochar in the second year following the addition. Therefore, 
microbial growth and functioning for N transforming and cycling in metal
contaminated soils could be largely improved with BSA at 40 t ha-1. Of course,
studies are still deserved to mimic the long term changes with biochar in N
cycling of the metal contaminated dry croplands.
