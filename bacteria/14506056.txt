The in vitro activities of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) alone or combined with
lysozyme, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine were investigated with
the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus
sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and
Porphyromonas gingivalis. hBD-3 showed bactericidal activity against all of the
bacterial species tested. The bactericidal effect was enhanced when the peptide
was used in combination with the antimicrobial agents mentioned above.
