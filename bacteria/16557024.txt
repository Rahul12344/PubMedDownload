BACKGROUND: This study examines the influence of surgical management (elimination
of the infectious focus and abdominal lavage) on survival and the inflammatory
response in the various compartments of the body: local (abdomen), systemic
(blood) and distant organ (lungs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peritonitis was established in mice by cecal ligation and 
puncture (CLP). After 24 h, a group was made in which the infected cecum was
resected and the abdominal cavity was lavaged (RES), and another group that
received no surgical resection (NoRES). Survival was examined over a period of 96
h. Mice were sacrificed at 24 (sham and CLP), 48 and 72 h after CLP to measure
inflammatory parameters.
RESULTS: Survival was significantly lower is NoRES compared to sham and RES (p = 
0.006, p = 0.014, respectively). Intraperitoneal parameters were improved in the 
RES group compared to sham but results were not significantly different between
groups. In plasma, levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were decreased in RES (p =
0.048). Accordingly, anti-inflammatory IL-10 in plasma was increased in this
group (p = 0.031). In the lung, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and
myeloperoxidase (MPO) was reduced indicating decreased granulocytes accumulation 
in the lung in the RES group (p = 0.012 and p = 0.004, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In experimental secondary peritonitis surgical management improves
survival and attenuates the inflammatory response predominantly in the
extra-abdominal compartments. This illustrates the importance of surgery in
prevention of multiple organ failure and denotes the compartmentalized character 
of the inflammatory response. This polymicrobial model with implicated surgical
intervention reflects the clinical situation and may be more appropriate to test 
therapeutic interventions than a model involving only CLP.
