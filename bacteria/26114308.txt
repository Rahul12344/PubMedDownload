Two series of 1-substituted carbamoyl and thiocarbomoyl derivatives were prepared
by either treating the corresponding pyrazole with the appropriate isocyanate and
isothiocyanate respectively, or alternatively by condensing the appropriate
diketone with the proper substituted semicarbazide or thiosemicarbazide. The
structures of the prepared compounds were fully determined by analytical and
spectral methods. Preliminary biological screening of the prepared compounds
revealed significant antibacterial and cytotoxic activities for some compounds.
Compounds 4a2 and 4a3 were found to be the most active against the human colon
carcinoma HT29 (11.8 and 7.5 μg/mL, respectively) and human breast cancer MCF 7
(3.4 and 2.6 μg/mL, respectively) cell lines. The structure-activity relationship
(SAR) and in silico drug relevant properties (HBD, HBA, tPSA, cLog P, molecular
weight, % ABS, drug-likeness and drug score) further confirmed that the compounds
are potential lead compounds for future drug discovery study.
