The domain II loops of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Aa form an overlapping
interaction site for two Bombyx mori larvae functional receptors, ABC transporter
C2 and cadherin-like receptor.

Information about the receptor-interaction region of Cry toxins, insecticidal
proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, is needed to elucidate the mode of
action of Cry toxins and improve their toxicity through protein engineering. We
analyzed the interaction sites on Cry1Aa with ABC transporter C2 (ABCC2), one of 
the most important Cry1A toxin receptors. A competitive binding assay revealed
that the Bombyx mori ABCC2 (BmABCC2) Cry1A binding site was the same as the
BtR175 binding site, suggesting that the loop region of Cry1Aa domain II is a
binding site. Next, we constructed several domain II loop mutant toxins and
tested their binding affinity in an SPR analysis, and also performed a cell
swelling assay to evaluate receptor-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results indicate
that the loop regions required for BtR175 and BmABCC2 binding and the regions
important for cytotoxicity partially overlap. Our results also suggest that
receptor binding is necessary but not sufficient for cytotoxicity. This is the
first report showing the region of interaction between ABCC2 and Cry1Aa and the
cytotoxicity-relevant properties of the Cry1Aa domain II loop region.
