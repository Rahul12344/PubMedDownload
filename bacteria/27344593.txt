Moenomycins are phosphoglycolipid antibiotics notable for their extreme potency, 
unique mode of action, and proven record of use in animal nutrition without
selection for resistant microflora. There is a keen interest in manipulation of
structures of moenomycins in order to better understand their structure-activity 
relationships and to generate improved analogs. Only two almost identical
moenomycin biosynthetic gene clusters are known, limiting our knowledge of the
evolution of moenomycin pathways and our ability to genetically diversify them.
Here, we report a novel gene cluster (tchm) that directs production of the
phosphoglycolipid teichomycin in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Its overall
genetic architecture is significantly different from that of the moenomycin
biosynthesis (moe) gene clusters of Streptomyces ghanaensis and Streptomyces
clavuligerus, featuring multiple gene rearrangements and two novel structural
genes. Involvement of the tchm cluster in teichomycin biosynthesis was confirmed 
via heterologous co-expression of amidotransferase tchmH5 and moe genes. Our work
sets the background for further engineering of moenomycins and for deeper
inquiries into the evolution of this fascinating biosynthetic pathway.
