The large-scale development of animal husbandry and the wide agricultural
application of livestock manure lead to more and more serious co-pollution of
heavy metals and antibiotics in soil. In this study, two common feed additives,
copper (Cu) and sulfadiazine (SDZ), were selected as target pollutants to
evaluate the toxicity and interaction of antibiotics and heavy metals on ammonia 
oxidizers diversity, potential nitrification rate (PNR), and enzymatic activity
in black soils. The results showed that soil enzyme activity was significantly
inhibited by single Cu pollution, but the toxicity could be reduced by
introducing low-concentration SDZ (5 mg · kg-1), which showed an antagonistic
effect between Cu and SDZ (5 mg · kg-1), while the combined toxicity of
high-concentration SDZ (10 mg · kg-1) and Cu were strengthened compared with the 
single Cu contamination on soil enzymes. In contrast, soil PNR was more sensitive
to single Cu pollution and its combined pollution with SDZ than the enzyme
activity. Real-time fluorescence quota PCR and Illumina Hiseq/Miseq sequencing
results showed that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was decreased in C2 (200 mg ·
kg-1 Cu treatment) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was obviously stimulated 
in soil contaminated in C2, while in S5 (5 mg · kg-1 SDZ treatment), AOB was
decreased; both AOA and AOB were significantly decreased at gene level in soils
with combined pollutants (C2S5, 200 mg · kg-1 Cu combined with 5 mg · kg-1 SDZ). 
So, it can be concluded that combined pollution can cause more serious toxicity
on the enzymatic activity, PNR, and ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in soil
through the synergistic effect between heavy metals and antibiotics pollutants.
