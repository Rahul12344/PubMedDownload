The mutagenic 8-oxoguanosine monophosphate, the predominant product of DNA
oxidation, is excised by formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg) in bacteria. The
mechanism of recognition of 8-oxodG, which differs subtly from its normal
counterpart, guanosine monophosphate (dG), by Escherichia coli Fpg remains
elusive due to the lack of structural data of E. coli Fpg bound to 8-oxodG. Here,
we present solution-state structure of 8-oxodG oligomer bound to E. coli E3Q Fpg 
using UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy. The vibrational spectra report on
the Ï€-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions established by 8-oxodG with E.
coli E3Q Fpg. Furthermore, we report on the interactions of E. coli E3Q Fpg with 
the normal, undamaged nucleotide, dG. We show that E. coli Fpg recognizes 8-oxodG
and dG through their C2-amino group but only 8-oxodG forms extensive contacts
with E. coli Fpg. Our findings provide a basis for mechanism of lesion
recognition by E. coli Fpg.
