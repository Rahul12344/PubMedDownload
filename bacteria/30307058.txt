Seborrhoeic Dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder, but its
molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. Previously, we have established the Mpzl3
knockout (-/-) mice as a model for SD. In this study, we focused on early phases 
of skin inflammation and determined the cytokine profiles and identified immune
cell types in the lesional skin in the Mpzl3 -/- mice. Using flow cytometry, we
detected a significant increase of CD45+ leucocytes, CD3+ T lymphocytes and
especially γδ T cells but not αβ T cells in the lesional skin compared to
control. We also detected high levels of IL-17 and determined that the γδ T cells
were a major contributing source. CD3+ and γδ T cell localization in the skin was
verified by indirect immunofluorescent staining. Since neither γδ T cells nor
IL-17 had been implicated in SD, our study provides novel insights into the role 
of MPZL3 in the pathogenesis of SD-like skin inflammation.
