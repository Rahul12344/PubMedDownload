A 24-day-old boy presented with fever, irritability and poor feeding. Blood
culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Cerebrospinal fluid
analysis showed pleocytosis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus grew
from enrichment broth. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural abscess
extending from C2-3 to T8-9. Staphylococcal infections of the central nervous
system are uncommon in neonates. This case demonstrates the importance of
performing a lumbar puncture in isolated staphylococcal bacteraemia. The case
also highlights that cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis may indicate a parameningeal
focus of infection.
