A cod hatching plant was established in 1992 on the island of Bornholm in the
Baltic Sea in order to elucidate the possibilities for restocking of cod fry in
this brackishwater system. The disease prevalence in 3 batches of hatchery-reared
yolksac larvae from the Baltic cod (Gadus morhua L.) was monitored during the
posthatch period. High prevalences of bacteriosis/mycosis, lordosis/scoliosis,
injuries and protozoan endoparasitism were recorded. Vibrio sp. and Vibrio
anguillarum serovar 04, 06, 08 in addition to nontypable strains and
saprolegniaceous fungi were isolated from the larvae. The dinoflagellate-like
endoparasites were located in the yolksac of the cod larvae.
