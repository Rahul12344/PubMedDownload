BACKGROUND: Human-beta defensins (HBD) belong to the family of acute phase
peptides and hold a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive and 
gram-negative bacteria. HBD are up-regulated after severe injuries but the source
of posttraumatic HBD expression has not been focused on before. In the current
study we analysed the role of liver tissue in expression of HBD after multiple
trauma in human and mice.
METHODS: HBD-2 expression has been detected in plasma samples of 32 multiple
trauma patients (ISS > 16) over 14 days after trauma by ELISA. To investigate
major sources of HBD-2, its expression and regulation in plasma samples,
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and human tissue samples of liver and skin
were analysed by ELISA. As liver samples of trauma patients are hard to obtain we
tried to review findings in an established trauma model. Plasma samples and liver
samples of 56 male C57BL/6 N-mice with a thorax trauma and a femur fracture were 
analysed by ELISA, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry for murine beta
defensin 4 (MBD-4) and compared with the expression of control group without
trauma. The induction of HBD-2 expression in cultured hepatocytes (Hep G2) was
analysed after incubation with IL-6, supernatant of Staphylococcus aureus (SA)
and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). One possible signalling pathway was tested by
blocking toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in hepatocytes.
RESULTS: Compared to healthy control group, plasma of multiple traumatized
patients and mice showed significantly higher defensin levels after trauma.
Compared to skin cells, which are known for high beta defensin expression, liver 
tissue showed less HBD-2 expression, but higher HBD-2 expression compared to PMN.
Immunhistochemical staining demonstrated upregulated MBD-4 in hepatocytes of
traumatised mice. In HepG2 cells HBD-2 expression could be increased by
stimulation with IL-6 and SA. Neutralization of HepG2 cells with αTLR2 showed
reduced HBD-2 expression after stimulation with SA.
CONCLUSION: Plasma samples of multiple traumatized patients showed high
expression of HBD-2, which may protect the severely injured patient from
overwhelming bacterial infection. Our data support the hypothesis that liver is
one possible source for HBD-2 in plasma while posttraumatic inflammatory
response.
