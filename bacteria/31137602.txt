We have used a simple model system to test the prediction that surface attachment
strength of filaments presenting a torsion would affect their shape and
properties. FtsZ from E. coli containing one cysteine in position 2 was
covalently attached to a lipid bilayer containing maleimide lipids either in
their head group (to simulate tight attachment) or at the end of a polyethylene
glycol molecule attached to the head group (to simulate loose binding). We found 
that filaments tightly attached grew straight, growing from both ends, until they
formed a two-dimensional lattice. Further monomer additions to their sides
generated a dense layer of oriented filaments that fully covered the lipid
membrane. After this point the surface became unstable and the bilayer detached
from the surface. Filaments with a loose binding were initially curved and later 
evolved into straight thicker bundles that destabilized the membrane after
reaching a certain surface density. Previously described theoretical models of
FtsZ filament assembly on surfaces that include lateral interactions, spontaneous
curvature, torsion, anchoring to the membrane, relative geometry of the surface
and the filament 'living-polymer' condition in the presence of guanosine
triphosphate (GTP) can offer some clues about the driving forces inducing these
filament rearrangements.
