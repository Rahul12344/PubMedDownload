Despite its declining incidence gastric cancer still ranks as the second most
common malignancy of the digestive tract, accounting for 10% of cancer deaths
worldwide. At the time of the diagnosis less than 15% of the patients are in the 
stage of early cancer, the only stage in which a definite cure of gastric cancer 
is possible. Therefore the challenges are either early detection or even better
prevention of gastric cancer. H. pylori has become recognized as the major risk
factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. Epidemiological, biological, histomorphologic,
molecular-genetic, epidemiological evidence and more recently few clinical trails
have shown that H. pylori eradication has the potential to prevent the
development of gastric cancer. Currently H. pylori eradication is an indication
for the prevention of gastric cancer in patients and groups of individuals with
strongly increased risk, but further investigations are still required before an 
implementation of a general and global policy to eradicate H. pylori for the
prevention of gastric cancer can be instituted. At present time, the main
challenge remains to find out at what point mucosal abnormalities are no longer
reversible and gastric cancer development cannot be prevented despite H. pylori
eradication.
