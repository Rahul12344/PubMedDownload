The costimulatory effects of anti-CD28 antibody or accessory cells on T cells
were shown to be very similar. Both stimuli: (a) allowed T cell proliferation and
IL-2 production in response to immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or antigen presented
by APC whose costimulatory capacity had been damaged by fixation; and (b)
stimulated cyclosporin A-resistant T cell proliferation in the presence of a
phorbol ester. These similarities raise the possibility that anti-CD28 antibody
binding to T cells delivers a costimulatory signal that is normally delivered by 
the interaction of CD28 with a complementary ligand on APC.
