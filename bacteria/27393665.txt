Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that bridge the
innate and adaptive immune system. NKT cells possess a classic αβ T cell receptor
(TCR) that is able to recognize self and foreign glycolipid antigens presented by
the nonclassical class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, CD1d.
Type I NKT cells (referred to as invariant NKT cells) express a semi-invariant
Vα14Jα18 TCR in mice and Vα24Jα18 TCR in humans. Type II NKT cells are
CD1d-restricted T cells that express a more diverse set of TCR α chains. The two 
types of NKT cells often exert opposing effects especially in tumor immunity,
where type II cells generally suppress tumor immunity while type I NKT cells can 
enhance anti-tumor immune responses. In this review, we focus on the role of NKT 
cells in cancer. We discuss their effector and suppressive functions, as well as 
describe preclinical and clinical studies utilizing therapeutic strategies
focused on harnessing their potent anti-tumor effector functions, and conclude
with a discussion on potential next steps for the utilization of NKT
cell-targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer.
