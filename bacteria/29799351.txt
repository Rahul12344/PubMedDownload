Bartonella henselae is a gram-negative bacillus implicated in cat-scratch
disease. Cat-scratch disease is usually self-limiting and results in local
lymphadenopathy. In rare circumstances, patients may develop endocarditis,
neuroretinitis, or osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis of the cervical spine is
exceedingly rare, especially in the pediatric population, and to date there have 
been only 4 previously reported cases of cervical spine osteomyelitis caused by
B. henselae, all of which were treated surgically. In this article, the authors
report the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with neck swelling and was
found to have a C2-4 paravertebral B. henselae abscess with osteomyelitis of C-3 
and epidural extension. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case
in the literature of a cervical spine B. henselae infection managed
conservatively.
