OBJECTIVE: Deletion of Deltex1 (DTX1) in mice caused hyperactivation of T cells
and lupus-like autoimmune syndromes, however, the association of DTX1 with human 
autoimmune diseases is totally unknown. This study investigated the role of DTX1 
in human T cell functions and its correlation with disease activity in patients
with SLE.
METHODS: The influence of DTX1 on T cell function was evaluated using human
primary cells. DTX1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
healthy controls and SLE patients was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and 
the SLEDAI was used to assess disease activity.
RESULTS: After stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, silencing of DTX1
expression enhanced IFN-γ secretion by human T cells. The expression of DTX1 in
PBMCs was significantly lower in 100 SLE patients than in 50 age- and sex-matched
healthy controls (DTX1/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.452 vs 1.269, 
P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of the
model was 0.737 (95% CI 0.658, 0.815). Intriguingly, a low DTX1 level in T cells 
led to high IFN-γ production in SLE patients and had a correlation with severe
disease activity. In addition, low DTX1 expression in SLE patients was associated
with active LN, lung involvement or hypocomplementaemia.
CONCLUSION: Knockdown DTX1 expression in human T cells reduced IFN-γ secretion.
DTX1 expression in the PBMCs was significantly lower in SLE patients and had an
inverse correlation with disease activity, indicating that the DTX1 level may be 
a good disease marker of SLE.
