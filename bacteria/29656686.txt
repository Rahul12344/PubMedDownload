CONTEXT: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 
especially TLR4 localized on microglia/macrophages, may play a significant role
in nociception.
OBJECTIVE: We examine the role of TLR4 in a neuropathic pain model. Using
behavioural/biochemical methods, we examined the influence of TLR4 antagonist on 
levels of hypersensitivity and nociceptive factors whose contribution to
neuropathy development has been confirmed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Behavioural (von Frey's/cold plate) tests were performed
with Wistar male rats after intrathecal administration of a TLR4 antagonist
(LPS-RS ULTRAPURE (LPS-RSU), 20 μG: lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter
sphaeroides, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) 16 H and 1 h before chronic constriction
injury (cci) to the sciatic nerve and then daily for 7 d. three groups were used:
an intact group and two cci-exposed groups that received vehicle or LPS-RSU.
tissue [spinal cord/dorsal root ganglia (DRG)] for western blot analysis was
collected on day 7.
RESULTS: The pharmacological blockade of TLR4 diminished mechanical (from ca. 40%
to 16% that in the INTACT group) and thermal (from ca. 51% to 32% that in the
INTACT group) hypersensitivity despite the enhanced activation of IBA-1-positive 
cells in DRG. Moreover, LPS-RSU changed the ratio between IL-18/IL-18BP and
MMP-9/TIMP-1 in favour of the increase of antinociceptive factors IL-18BP
(25%-spinal; 96%-DRG) and TIMP-1 (15%-spinal; 50%-DRG) and additionally led to an
increased IL-6 (40%-spinal; 161%-DRG), which is known to have analgesic
properties in neuropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that LPS-RSU influences pain through
the expression of TLR4. TLR4 blockade has analgesic properties and restores the
balance between nociceptive factors, which indicates its engagement in neuropathy
development.
