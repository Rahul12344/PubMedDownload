Three-dimensional chromosomal conformations regulate transcription by moving
enhancers and regulatory elements into spatial proximity with target genes. Here 
we describe activity-regulated long-range loopings bypassing up to 0.5 Mb of
linear genome to modulate NMDA glutamate receptor GRIN2B expression in human and 
mouse prefrontal cortex. Distal intronic and 3' intergenic loop formations
competed with repressor elements to access promoter-proximal sequences, and
facilitated expression via a "cargo" of AP-1 and NRF-1 transcription factors and 
TALE-based transcriptional activators. Neuronal deletion or overexpression of
Kmt2a/Mll1 H3K4- and Kmt1e/Setdb1 H3K9-methyltransferase was associated with
higher-order chromatin changes at distal regulatory Grin2b sequences and
impairments in working memory. Genetic polymorphisms and isogenic deletions of
loop-bound sequences conferred liability for cognitive performance and decreased 
GRIN2B expression. Dynamic regulation of chromosomal conformations emerges as a
novel layer for transcriptional mechanisms impacting neuronal signaling and
cognition.
