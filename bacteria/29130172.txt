Bacteria use chemical molecules called autoinducers as votes to poll their
numerical strength in a colony. This polling mechanism, commonly referred to as
quorum sensing, enables bacteria to build a social network and provide a
collective response for fighting off common threats. In Gram-negative bacteria,
AHL synthases synthesize acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers to turn on
the expression of several virulent genes including biofilm formation, protease
secretion, and toxin production. Therefore, inhibiting AHL signal synthase would 
limit quorum sensing and virulence. In this chapter, we describe four enzymatic
methods that could be adopted to investigate a broad array of AHL synthases. The 
enzymatic assays described here should accelerate our mechanistic understanding
of quorum-sensing signal synthesis that could pave the way for discovery of
potent antivirulence compounds.
