Gut microbiota mediated low-grade inflammation is involved in the onset of type 2
diabetes (T2DM). In this study, we used a high fat sucrose (HFS) diet-induced
pre-insulin resistance and a low dose-STZ HFS rat models to study the effect and 
mechanism of Lactobacillus casei Zhang in protecting against T2DM onset.
Hyperglycemia was favorably suppressed by L. casei Zhang treatment. Moreover, the
hyperglycemia was connected with type 1 immune response, high plasma bile acids
and urine chloride ion loss. This chloride ion loss was significantly prevented
by L. casei via upregulating of chloride ion-dependent genes (ClC1-7, GlyRα1,
SLC26A3, SLC26A6, GABAAα1, Bestrophin-3 and CFTR). A shift in the caecal
microflora, particularly the reduction of bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria, 
and fecal bile acid profiles also occurred. These change coincided with organ
chloride influx. Thus, we postulate that the prevention of T2DM onset by L. casei
Zhang may be via a microbiota-based bile acid-chloride exchange mechanism.
