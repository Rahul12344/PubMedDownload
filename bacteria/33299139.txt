PTEN tumor suppressor opposes the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the cytoplasm and
maintains chromosomal integrity in the nucleus. Nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling of
PTEN is regulated by ubiquitylation, SUMOylation and phosphorylation, and nuclear
PTEN has been proposed to exhibit tumor-suppressive functions. Here we show that 
PTEN is conjugated by Nedd8 under high glucose conditions, which induces PTEN
nuclear import without effects on PTEN stability. PTEN neddylation is promoted by
the XIAP ligase and removed by the NEDP1 deneddylase. We identify Lys197 and
Lys402 as major neddylation sites on PTEN. Neddylated PTEN accumulates
predominantly in the nucleus and promotes rather than suppresses cell
proliferation and metabolism. The nuclear neddylated PTEN dephosphorylates the
fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein, inhibits the TRIM21-mediated ubiquitylation
and degradation of FASN, and then promotes de novo fatty acid synthesis. In human
breast cancer tissues, neddylated PTEN correlates with tumor progression and poor
prognosis. Therefore, we demonstrate a previously unidentified pool of nuclear
PTEN in the Nedd8-conjugated form and an unexpected tumor-promoting role of
neddylated PTEN.
