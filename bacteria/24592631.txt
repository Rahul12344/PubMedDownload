Infectious microorganisms can be transmitted by various routes. Respiratory and
facial protection is needed to prevent infection with organisms that are usually 
transmitted through the droplet/airborne route, or when airborne particles have
been artificially created, for example during aerosol-generating procedures.
Recent experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic (H1N1)
influenza in 2009 highlighted that health professionals may have difficulty in
choosing the correct facial and respiratory protection. The Scientific
Development Committee of the Healthcare Infection HealtSociety established a
working group to develop guidance addressing this issue.
