CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are a group of innate-like regulatory 
T cells that recognize lipid antigens. Both mouse modeling experiments and human 
clinical studies have suggested a key role for iNKT cells in anti-HBV immunity
and these potent T cells can be explored as a novel therapeutic target for
anti-HBV treatment. We aim to humanize mice in the CD1d/iNKT cell lipid
presentation system and provide new research tools for identifying novel anti-HBV
agents.
