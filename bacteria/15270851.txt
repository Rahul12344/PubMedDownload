Umbilical cord blood has emerged as an alternative source of haematopoietic CD34+
cells for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although bacteraemia induced by
Escherichia coli is considered one of the complications of transplantation,
expression of proinflammatory cytokines is poorly understood. In this study, we
report the altered expression of proinflammatory cytokines in CD34+ cells and
their in vitro cultured cells following E. coli infection. CD34+ stem cells and
their cultured cells up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as
interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha after 
infection with E. coli. Expression of the proinflammatory cytokines was generated
mainly by the granulocyte-macrophage lineages. E. coli infection activated the
signals of p50/p50 nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) homodimers and IkappaB
kinase. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation lowered the up-regulated 
expression of the proinflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that CD34+
cells and their cultured cells infected with E. coli induce the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines via the NF-kappaB pathway.
