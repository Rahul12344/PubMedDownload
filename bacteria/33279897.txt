BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis of oral microbiota is implicated not only in oral
inflammatory lesions, but also in a variety of extraoral diseases. The etiology
of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) remains unclear; however, it has been suggested 
that chronic inflammation caused by periodontopathic bacterial infection may play
a role.
OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To determine whether patients with PPP have altered diversity
and composition of oral microbiota, we conducted the 16S rDNA analysis using
saliva samples collected from 21 outpatients with PPP and 10 healthy individuals.
RESULTS: We found that the proportion of bacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria
was significantly lower in PPP patients (p = 0.025). At the genus level, patients
with PPP had a significantly lower abundance of Neisseria (p = 0.014), which best
accounted for the observed decrease in Proteobacteria. We also identified
multiple minor genera and species that were represented at a significantly higher
level in the PPP group, several of which have been associated with periodontal
diseases.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a possible link between PPP and dysbiosis of oral
microbiota, particularly the lower abundance of Neisseria, the most predominant
genus of Proteobacteria in healthy oral microbiota. Probiotics that improves oral
dysbiosis may be beneficial for patients with PPP as an adjunctive therapy.
