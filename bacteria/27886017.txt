PURPOSE: Proprioceptive insoles are known to influence the functions of posture
and gait by modulations of the sensory structures at the sole of the foot.
Literature has shown that they could improve the position of the upper-body in
patients with postural complaints of the musculoskeletal system. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the influence of proprioceptive insoles on the spinal
curvature in patients with slight idiopathic scoliosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients were included in this prospective,
single-centre, randomized study. All patients needed to have a relevant growth
potential and suffered from a slight idiopathic scoliosis. Two groups were used, 
where group 1 performed physiotherapy twice a week, whereas group 2 was
additionally supplied with proprioceptive insoles. Patients underwent
three-dimensional rasterstereography for back-shape analysis. Furthermore, a
conventional x-ray imaging of the spine was performed at the beginning and 1 year
later to document the curvatures.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the Cobb angles, and in almost
all parameters of the rasterstereography, there was no statistically significant 
change between and within both groups.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, there was no evidence of any 
statistical significant effect of proprioceptive insoles on spinal curvature in
patients with slight idiopathic scoliosis.
