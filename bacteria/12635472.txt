BACKGROUND: It is known that infections with Serratia marcescens can take a
progressive course in preterm infants and that meningoencephalitis with this
pathogen exhibits an extremely bad neurologic prognosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on five cases of septicemia with Serratia
marcescens in preterm infants during a nosocomial outbreak. Three patients
developed meningoencephalitis with brain abscesses. Mild clinical and laboratory 
findings of infection contrasted with destructive findings on MRI scan. All five 
patients survived, those with isolated bacteremia without neurologic sequelae.
CONCLUSION: When Serratia marcescens is isolated from any source in a neonatal
intensive care unit, preventive measures including strict hygiene and cohorting
of infants must be implemented immediately since this pathogen seems to exhibit
specific affinity for the central nervous system and Serratia marcescens
meningoencephalitis takes a progressive and destructive course despite antibiotic
therapy.
