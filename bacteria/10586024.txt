In this report, we describe the use of novel mass spectrometry instrumentation to
identify a male-specific minor histocompatibility Ag restricted by HLA-A*0101
(A1-HY). This Ag has the sequence IVDC*LTEMY, where C* represents a cysteine
disulfide bonded to a second cysteine residue. The core peptide sequence is found
in the protein product of DFFRY, a Y chromosome gene not previously identified as
the source of an HY Ag. The male-specific form of the peptide differs from its X 
chromosomal counterpart by the substitution of serine for the C* residue. Both
peptides are expressed on the cell surface at 30 or fewer copies per cell.
However, A1-HY-specific CTL recognize the DFFRY-derived peptide at a 1500-fold
lower dose than the female homologue. Thus, these studies have identified a new
source of HY epitopes and provide additional information about the influence of
posttranslational modifications of class I-associated peptides on T cell
recognition.
