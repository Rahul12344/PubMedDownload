OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine predictive factors for
neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients with syphilis and optimize the use of
lumbar puncture.
STUDY DESIGN: The authors reviewed 112 cases of HIV-infected patients with
syphilis who underwent a lumbar puncture. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis was based on
a cerebrospinal fluid white blood cells count > or =20/microL, and/or a reactive 
cerebrospinal fluid-Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, and/or a positive
intrathecal T. pallidum antibody (ITPA) index.
RESULTS: Twenty-six of 112 had neurosyphilis. Neurologic manifestations and serum
rapid plasma reagin (RPR) were associated with neurosyphilis (P = 0.036, P =
0.018, respectively). In multivariate analysis, log(2)RPR was still associated
with neurosyphilis (P = 0.005). In patients without neurologic manifestations,
the risk of neurosyphilis increases gradually with log(2)RPR. A serum RPR of 1/32
seems to be the best cutoff point to decide the performance or not of a lumbar
puncture (sensitivity 100%, specificity 40%).
CONCLUSION: In HIV-infected patients with syphilis, lumbar puncture could be
restricted to those with neurologic manifestations or a serum RPR > or =1/32.
