Preclinical studies have suggested that platelets influence the host response
during sepsis. We sought to assess the association of admission thrombocytopenia 
with the presentation, outcome, and host response in patients with sepsis. Nine
hundred thirty-one consecutive sepsis patients were stratified according to
platelet counts (very low <50 × 10(9)/L, intermediate-low 50 × 10(9) to 99 ×
10(9)/L, low 100 × 10(9) to 149 × 10(9)/L, or normal 150 × 10(9) to 399 ×
10(9)/L) on admission to the intensive care unit. Sepsis patients with platelet
counts <50 × 10(9)/L and 50 × 10(9) to 99 × 10(9)/L presented with higher Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores and more shock. Both levels of
thrombocytopenia were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality
(hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals 2.00 [1.32-3.05] and 1.72
[1.22-2.44], respectively). To account for baseline differences besides platelet 
counts, propensity matching was performed, after which the association between
thrombocytopenia and the host response was tested, as evaluated by measuring 17
plasma biomarkers indicative of activation and/or dysregulation of pathways
implicated in sepsis pathogenesis and by whole genome blood leukocyte expression 
profiling. In the propensity matched cohort, platelet counts < 50 × 10(9)/L were 
associated with increased cytokine levels and enhanced endothelial cell
activation. All thrombocytopenic groups showed evidence of impaired vascular
integrity, whereas coagulation activation was similar between groups. Blood
microarray analysis revealed a distinct gene expression pattern in sepsis
patients with <50 × 10(9)/L platelets, showing reduced signaling in leukocyte
adhesion and diapedesis and increased complement signaling. These data show that 
admission thrombocytopenia is associated with enhanced mortality and a more
disturbed host response during sepsis independent of disease severity, thereby
providing clinical validity to animal studies on the role of platelets in severe 
infection.
