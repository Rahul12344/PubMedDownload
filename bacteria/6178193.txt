A heterophile system in human renal transplantation. X. HTA sensitivity includes 
sensitivity to human B lymphocytes.

McDonald JC, Gelder FB, Rohr MS.

Antibodies that react with heterophile transplantation antigen (HTA) have been
shown previously not to react with HLA-A, B, or C antigens. This paper presents
evidence that anti-HTA does react with a subpopulation of human lymphocytes which
is comprised primarily of B cells. Anti-HTA reactivity was removed from sera by
absorption with each of three different human B lymphocyte cell lines, but it was
unaffected by absorption with platelets or thymocytes. Selected high titer
anti-HTA sera absorbed with human platelets, human blood group type AB
erythrocytes, and sheep erythrocytes caused lysis of a lymphocyte subpopulation
principally composed of B lymphocytes. Absorption of these sera with rat
erythrocytes removed both lymphocytic activity and anti-HTA activity. Antibody
recovered by affinity purification with rat erythrocyte membrane preparations
contained both lymphocytic and anti-HTA reactivity. These data, considered with
previous studies, seem to establish that B cell sensitization may be acquired by 
a substantial segment of the population by natural immunization from enteric
flora and/or by infections with enteric bacteria.
