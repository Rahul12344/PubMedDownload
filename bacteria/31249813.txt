Chlamydia trachomatis infections are the most prevalent sexually transmitted
infections with potentially debilitating sequelae, such as infertility. Mouse
models are generally used for vaccine development, to study the immune response
and histopathology associated with Chlamydia infection. An important question
regarding murine models is the in vivo identification of murine host genes
responsible for the elimination of the murine and human Chlamydia strains. RNA
sequencing of the Chlamydia muridarum infected BALB/c lung transcriptome revealed
that several genes with direct antichlamydial functions were induced at the
tissue level, including the already described and novel members of the murine
interferon-inducible GTPase family, the CXCL chemokines CXCL9, CXCL11,
immunoresponsive gene 1, nitric oxide synthase-2 (iNOS), and lipocalin-2.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1-2 (IDO1-2) previously described potent
antichlamydial host enzymes were also highly expressed in the infected murine
lungs. This finding was novel, since IDO was considered as a unique human
antichlamydial defense gene. Besides a lower level of epithelial cell positivity,
immunohistochemistry showed that IDO1-2 proteins were expressed prominently in
macrophages. Detection of the tryptophan degradation product kynurenine and the
impact of IDO inhibition on Chlamydia muridarum growth proved that the IDO1-2
proteins were functionally active. IDO1-2 activity also increased in Chlamydia
muridarum infected C57BL/6 lung tissues, indicating that this phenomenon is not
mouse strain specific. Our study shows that the murine antichlamydial response
includes a variety of highly up-regulated defense genes in vivo. Among these
genes the antichlamydial effectors IDO1-2 were identified. The potential impact
of murine IDO1-2 expression on Chlamydia propagation needs further investigation.
