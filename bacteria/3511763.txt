Third generation cephalosporin antibiotics in surgical practice.

Fry DE.

The new third generation cephalosporins have a significantly greater spectrum of 
action against gram-negative bacteria likely to be encountered in surgical
infections. This expanded spectrum may permit these drugs to be used in place of 
combination therapy in patients with polymicrobial infections; however, current
evidence does not indicate superior results with these agents over earlier
generation choices for surgical prophylaxis. The toxicity profile of these drugs 
warrants close monitoring for serious complications.
