BACKGROUND: Imbalance of the human gut microbiota in childhood, mainly due to low
gut biodiversity and a low bifidobacterial load, has been suggested as a risk
factor for atopy. Administration of Enterococcus faecium L3 in infants has been
shown to increase the gut bifidobacterial count. The aim was to verify if a
mixture of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 and E. faecium L3 could
reduce the signs, symptoms and need for drugs in atopic children.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed, and compared with controls, clinical
outcomes following use of BB12 and L3 strains when administered 3 months before
or during the development of signs and symptoms of atopy.
RESULTS: When administered in the 3 months before the development of atopy, the
BB12 and L3 strains significantly reduced (P<0.001) rhinitis, watery eyes and
cough/bronchospasm. However, reduced efficacy was observed when the mixture was
given during the 3 months of atopy. The mixture of strains also significantly
reduced the use of oral antihistamines, inhaled corticosteroids (in the same
children in two different years) and oral corticosteroids (in different children 
in the same year).
CONCLUSIONS: When administered as a prophylactic, the mixture of BB12 and L3
(iNatal PedÂ®) statistically decreases the signs and symptoms of atopy and reduces
the use of drugs. Administration of the same probiotics as treatment after the
appearance of atopy is less effective.
