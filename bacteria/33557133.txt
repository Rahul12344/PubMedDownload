The interaction and crosstalk of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is an established
pathway in which the innate immune system recognises and fights pathogens. In a
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis of an Indian cohort, we found
evidence for both TLR4-399T and TRL8-1A conveying increased susceptibility
towards tuberculosis (TB) in an interdependent manner, even though there is no
established TLR4 ligand present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which is the
causative pathogen of TB. Docking studies revealed that TLR4 and TLR8 can build a
heterodimer, allowing interaction with TLR8 ligands. The conformational change of
TLR4-399T might impair this interaction. With immunoprecipitation and mass
spectrometry, we precipitated TLR4 with TLR8-targeted antibodies, indicating
heterodimerisation. Confocal microscopy confirmed a high co-localisation
frequency of TLR4 and TLR8 that further increased upon TLR8 stimulation. The
heterodimerisation of TLR4 and TLR8 led to an induction of IL12p40, NF-κB, and
IRF3. TLR4-399T in interaction with TLR8 induced an increased NF-κB response as
compared to TLR4-399C, which was potentially caused by an alteration of
subsequent immunological pathways involving type I IFNs. In summary, we present
evidence that the heterodimerisation of TLR4 and TLR8 at the endosome is involved
in Mtb recognition via TLR8 ligands, such as microbial RNA, which induces a Th1
response. These findings may lead to novel targets for therapeutic interventions 
and vaccine development regarding TB.
