The surface of mammalian bodies is colonized by a multitude of microbial
organisms, which under normal conditions support the host and are considered
beneficial commensals. This requires, however, that the composition of the
commensal microbiota is tightly controlled and regulated. The host immune system 
plays an important role in the maintenance of this microbiota composition. Here
we focus on the contribution of one particular immune cell type, invariant
Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, in this process. The iNKT cells are a unique
subset of T cells characterized by two main features. First, they express an
invariant T-cell receptor that recognizes glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d, 
a non-polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I-like molecule. Second,
iNKT cells develop as effector/memory cells and swiftly exert effector functions,
like cytokine production and cytotoxicity, after activation. We outline the
influence that the mucosal microbiota can have on iNKT cells, and how iNKT cells 
contribute to the maintenance of the microbiota composition.
