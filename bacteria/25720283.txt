[Change in the concentration of intracellular ATP during adhesion of Rhodococcus 
ruber gt1 and pseudomonas fluorescens C2 cells on carbon supports].

Maksimova IuG, Demakov VA.

The effect of immobilization of nitrile-utilizing bacteria Rhodococcus ruber gt1 
and Pseudomonasfluorescens C2 by adhesion on carbon supports on the content of
the intracellular ATP immediately after adsorption and after 2 h and 24-48 h
after transfer of the adhered cells into a fresh nutrient medium was studied.
Adhesion was shown to lead to a decreased concentration ofATP in a cell by one
order of magnitude or more in the first hours in a fresh nutrient medium that'can
be attributed to energetic consumption upon the initiation of biofilm formation. 
A gradual rise in the quantity of ATP, which was calculated per 1 mg of adsorbed 
cells, was reported to take place in daily and two-daily biofilms, which confirms
the cells remain viable.
