MtDNA sequence variation is presumed to be neutral in effect, but associations
with diseases and mtDNA haplogroups have been reported. The aim here was to
evaluate the functional consequences of m.4216T>C present in haplogroup J.
Furthermore, we evaluated m.3866T>C in MT-ND1, a variant detected in a child
belonging to haplogroup J and with an isolated complex I deficiency. Homologous
substitutions were introduced into Escherichia coli. NADH dehydrogenase domain
activity of NDH-1 with either one or both mutations was markedly decreased
suggesting that m.4216T>C and m.3866T>C may have an effect on the structural
integrity of complex I.
