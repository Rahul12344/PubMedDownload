Antimicrobial peptides are active against a diverse spectrum of microorganisms.
Using a bioinformatics method, six potential novel antimicrobial peptides, A1,
C1, A2, A3, C2 and A4, were identified in the C8α complement component. The
corresponding genes were then cloned into a new vector as fusions with the
self-cleavage protein N(pro) protein mutant EDDIE gene. The expressed or
synthetic peptides, A1, A2, A3 and A4, showed antimicrobial activities against
several bacteria, while peptides C1 and C2 did not. Peptides A1 to A4 showed no
hemolytic activities over 3 h when at 500 μg/ml. Thus, A1, A2, A3 and A4, derived
from the C8α complement system, are novel antimicrobial peptides.
