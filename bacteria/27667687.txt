Activated macrophages undergo metabolic reprogramming, which drives their
pro-inflammatory phenotype, but the mechanistic basis for this remains obscure.
Here, we demonstrate that upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, macrophages 
shift from producing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis while also
increasing succinate levels. We show that increased mitochondrial oxidation of
succinate via succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and an elevation of mitochondrial
membrane potential combine to drive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production. RNA sequencing reveals that this combination induces a
pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, while an inhibitor of succinate
oxidation, dimethyl malonate (DMM), promotes an anti-inflammatory outcome.
Blocking ROS production with rotenone by uncoupling mitochondria or by expressing
the alternative oxidase (AOX) inhibits this inflammatory phenotype, with AOX
protecting mice from LPS lethality. The metabolic alterations that occur upon
activation of macrophages therefore repurpose mitochondria from ATP synthesis to 
ROS production in order to promote a pro-inflammatory state.
