PURPOSE: To determine whether rapamycin altered corneal growth factor levels to
impact severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with rapamycin or PBS and
infected with P. aeruginosa. Corneas were harvested and mRNA levels of growth
factors (EGF, HGF, FGF-7/KGF), receptors (EGFR, c-met, FGFR-2), and signaling
molecules (PI3K, Akt, S6K1, and IGF-1R) tested. ELISA determined HGF/c-met,
IGF-1, and Substance P (SP) protein levels. Corneal application of recombinant
(r)HGF was assessed by clinical score, photography with a slit lamp, real-time
RT-PCR (mRNA for mT0R, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, PI3KCα, Akt), and ELISA (total and
phosphorylated [p]c-met); rIGF-1 effects also were tested by ELISA. In vitro, RAW
cells and peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS ± rHGF ± c-met
inhibitor (CI) and mTOR mRNA levels tested.
RESULTS: Rapamycin disparately regulated infected corneal mRNA levels of EGF/EGFR
and FGF-7/FGFR-2, but HGF/c-met mRNA levels both increased. ELISA confirmed
elevated HGF protein. Rapamycin did not change PI3KCα or Akt signaling molecule
expression, downregulated S6K1, but upregulated IGF-1R mRNA levels; IGF-1 and SP 
proteins also were upregulated. After infection, topical rHGF versus PBS
increased mRNA levels of IL-12p40, IL-18, PI3KCα, and Akt; mTOR and IL-10 mRNA
were downregulated; rIGF-1 increased HGF protein. In vitro, rHGF and LPS lowered 
RAW cell and macrophage mTOR levels; CI addition restored them.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data provide evidence that enhanced corneal HGF 
levels increase signaling through the c-met receptor, decrease mTOR levels, and
enhance proinflammatory cytokines, while decreasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
and that HGF signaling is central to disease outcome.
