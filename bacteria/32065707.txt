Ion pairing between the major phospholipids of the Staphylococcus aureus plasma
membrane (phosphatidylglycerol - PG and lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol - LPG) confers
resistance to antimicrobial peptides and other antibiotics. We developed 3adLPG, 
a stable synthetic analogue which can substitute for the highy-labile native LPG,
in biophysical experiments examining the membrane-protecting role of lipid ion
pairing, in S. aureus and other important bacteria. Here we examine the surface
charge and lipid packing characteristics of synthetic biomimetic mixtures of DPPG
and DP3adLPG in Langmuir monolayers, using a combination of complementary
surface-probing techniques such as infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy
and grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction. The resultant phase diagram for the ion 
paired lipids sheds light on the mixing behavior of lipids in monolayer models of
resistant phenotype bacterial membranes, and provides a platform for future
biophysical studies.
