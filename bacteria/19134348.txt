OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)
regulations of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) by challenge of Porphyromonas
gingivalis (Pg) with different fimA genotypes.
METHODS: Pg ATCC 33277 (type I), WCSP115 (type II), WCSP1.5 (type III), W83 (type
IV) were assessed for their inductions of MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression in HGF. MMP 
mRNA levels of HGF were determined by real-time RT-PCR and MMP protein levels in 
culture supernatant were determined by ELISA at different time intervals (1, 3, 6
and 12 h) following continuous co-culture of bacteria with HGF.
RESULTS: When co-cultured with Pg, the MMP-1 and MMP-2 mRNA and protein
expression of HGF significantly increased compared with the negative control
group (P < 0.01). The group of type II showed greater up-regulated than other
fimA genotypes in the mRNA and protein expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-2, MMP-1 mRNA
[(28.88 +/- 3.12) - (231.01 +/- 24.99)] and protein [(1.35 +/- 0.17) - (3.08 +/- 
1.20)] microg/L; MMP-2 mRNA [(20.42 +/- 2.21) - (188.34 +/- 37.37)] and protein
[(2.57 +/- 0.76) - (18.08 +/- 1.15)] microg/L for different time periods; While
the group of type III was weaker than other fimA genotypes, the level of MMP-1
mRNA was [(5.11 +/- 0.55) - (72.84 +/- 8.84)] and protein [(0.68 +/- 0.13) -
(1.46 +/- 0.94)] microg/L, MMP-2 mRNA [(4.55 +/- 0.55) - (25.75 +/- 3.12)] and
protein [(2.28 +/- 0.93) - (11.22 +/- 2.46)] microg/L (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Pg could induce HGF to over-express MMP, and fimA genotypes of Pg
may be related to this pathogenicity, which might indicate fimA genotype is
associated with pathogenesis of Pg.
