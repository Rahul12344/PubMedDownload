A cultured cell line of mouse fibroblasts was transfected with DNA from murine
leukemia cells expressing a previously characterized tumor-associated antigen.
Antigen-positive cells were used as immunogens in an immunotherapy protocol to
determine if they stimulated resistance to the malignant proliferation of the
leukemia in susceptible mice. For the experiments, LM(TK-) mouse fibroblasts, a
thymidine kinase-deficient mouse cell line, were cotransfected with DNA from
ASL-1 murine leukemia cells and the plasmid pSV2neo conferring resistance to
Geneticin. Integration of the plasmid into cellular DNA was confirmed by
restriction digest blot analysis. A/J mice, highly susceptible to the malignant
proliferation of passively transferred ASL-1 leukemia cells, were immunized with 
the transfected cells. Animals receiving two prior injections of antigen-positive
transfected cells and then challenged with an injection of viable ASL-1 cells
survived longer than animals in the unprotected control group or in the group
receiving immunizations with LM(TK-) cells transfected with plasmid only (p less 
than 0.01). Some of the mice appeared to have rejected the tumor and lived more
than 80 days. One group of protected animals rechallenged with a second injection
of ASL-1 cells, 40 days after the first, survived for more than 50 additional
days, without evidence of recurrent disease.
