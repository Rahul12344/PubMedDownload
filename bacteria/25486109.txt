The present study highlights the biological effects of chromomycin A2 toward
metastatic melanoma cells in culture. Besides chromomycin A2, chromomycin A3 and 
demethylchromomycin A2 were also identified from the extract derived from
Streptomyces sp., recovered from Paracuru Beach, located in the northeast region 
of Brazil. The cytotoxic activity of chromomycin A2 was evaluated across a panel 
of human tumor cell lines, which found IC50 values in the nM-range for exposures 
of 48 and 72 h. MALME-3M, a metastatic melanoma cell line, showed the highest
sensitivity to chromomycin A2 after 48h incubation, and was chosen as a model to 
investigate this potent cytotoxic effect. Treatment with chromomycin A2 at 30 nM 
reduced cell proliferation, but had no significant effect upon cell viability.
Additionally, chromomycin A2 induced accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase of the 
cell cycle, with consequent reduction of S and G2/M and unbalanced expression of 
cyclins. Chromomycin A2 treated cells depicted several cellular fragments
resembling autophagosomes and increased expression of proteins LC3-A and LC3-B.
Moreover, exposure to chromomycin A2 also induced the appearance of acidic
vacuolar organelles in treated cells. These features combined are suggestive of
the induction of autophagy promoted by chromomycin A2, a feature not previously
described for chromomycins.
