BACKGROUND: The incidence of cognitive decline has been proposed to rise
exponentially in coming years. Therapies targeting molecular pathways involved in
enhancement of memory and energy regulation could be a major breakthrough in
prevention or management of dementia in susceptible populations.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of aqueous extracts of Cola
nitida (AECONS) and Garcinia kola (AEGAK) on glutamate level and Na+/K+-ATPase
activity in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of male Wistar rats.
METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (170-200) were randomly allotted into groups
(n=5/group); control (distilled water p.o.), AECONS1 (200 mg/kg), AECONS2 (400
mg/kg), AEGAK1 (200 mg/kg), AEGAK2 (400 mg/kg), AECONS1+AEGAK1 and
AECONS2+AEGAK2. The extract was prepared and the administration was done daily
for 6 weeks.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Administration of AECONS or AEGAK increased plasma,
hippocampal and hypothalamic glutamate, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, NO, SOD except
hippocampal glutamate in AECONS1/AEGAK1, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and SOD in
AEGAK1, hypothalamic glutamate and SOD in AECONS1 when compared with control.
Besides, MDA level decreased in AEGAK2 and hippocampal but not hypothalamic MDA
decreased in AEGAK1 compared with control. However, concomitant administration of
AECONS and AEGAK enhanced plasma, hippocampal and hypothalamic biomarkers except 
hypothalamic MDA level. The present study demonstrates that AECONS and AEGAK
synergistically enhances hippocampal and hypothalamic glutamate and Na+/K+-ATPase
activity, which are accompanied by NO and SOD-dependent antioxidant enrichment.
CONCLUSION: These findings therefore suggest that AECONS+AEGAK could be a better 
therapeutic candidate in hippocampal-hypothalamic-related neurodegenerative
diseases.
