In an antibiotic lead discovery program, the known strain Streptomyces armeniacus
DSM19369 has been found to produce three new natural products when cultivated on 
a malt-containing medium. The challenging structural elucidation of the isolated 
compounds was achieved by using three independent methods, that is, chemical
degradation followed by NMR spectroscopy, a computer-assisted structure
prediction algorithm, and X-ray crystallography. The compounds, named
armeniaspirol A-C (2-4), exhibit a compact, hitherto unprecedented chlorinated
spiro[4.4]non-8-ene scaffold. Labeling experiments with [1-(13)C] acetate,
[1,2-(13)C2] acetate, and [U-(13)C] proline suggest a biosynthesis through a rare
two-chain mechanism. Armeniaspirols displayed moderate to high in vitro
activities against gram-positive pathogens such as methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VRE). As analogue 2 was active 
in vivo in an MRSA sepsis model, and showed no development of resistance in a
serial passaging experiment, it represents a new antibiotic lead structure.
