Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) typing was applied to 116
Streptococcus suis isolates with different clinical backgrounds
(invasive/pneumonia/carrier/human) and with known profiles of
virulence-associated genes (cps1, -2, -7 and -9, as well as mrp, epf and sly). A 
dendrogram was generated that allowed identification of two clusters (A and C)
with different subclusters (A1, A2, C1 and C2) and two heterogeneous groups of
strains (B and D). For comparison, three strains from each AFLP subcluster and
group were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. The closest
relationship and lowest diversity were found for patterns clustering within AFLP 
subcluster A1, which corresponded with sequence type (ST) complex 1. Strains
within subcluster A1 were mainly invasive cps1 and mrp+ epf+ (or epf*) sly+ cps2+
strains of porcine or human origin. A new finding of this study was the
clustering of invasive mrp* cps9 isolates within subcluster A2. MLST analysis
suggested that A2 correlates with a single ST complex (ST87). In contrast to A1
and A2, subclusters C1 and C2 contained mainly pneumonia isolates of genotype
cps7 or cps2 and epf- sly-. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that AFLP
allows identification of clusters of S. suis strains with clinical relevance.
