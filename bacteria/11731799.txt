To initiate an immune response, key receptor-ligand pairs must cluster in "immune
synapses" at the T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) interface. We visualized
the accumulation of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule,
I-E(k), at a T cell-B cell interface and found it was dependent on both antigen
recognition and costimulation. This suggests that costimulation-driven active
transport of T cell surface molecules helps to drive immunological synapse
formation. Although only agonist peptide-MHC class II (agonist pMHC class II)
complexes can initiate T cell activation, endogenous pMHC class II complexes also
appeared to accumulate. To test this directly, we labeled a "null" pMHC class II 
complex and found that, although it lacked major TCR contact residues, it could
be driven into the synapse in a TCR-dependent manner. Thus, low-affinity ligands 
can contribute to synapse formation and T cell signaling.
