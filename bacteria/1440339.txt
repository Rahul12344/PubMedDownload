Microbiological, immunological and immunohistochemical studies were carried out
in 78 children with different clinicomorphological forms of chronic
glomerulonephritis (GN). According to the data obtained, the role of
streptococcal infection (SI) is inconclusive in certain clinicomorphological
forms of chronic GN, suggesting different approaches to the treatment of these
patients. The etiological role of SI is most probable in mesangioproliferative
and mesangiocapillary GN, manifesting by hematuric and mixed forms of chronic GN.
Antibacterial therapy is indicated to patients with a rise of the level of ASL-O 
and with the clinical signs of acute SI or exacerbation of chronic tonsillitis in
the same patients, especially during immunosuppressive therapy.
