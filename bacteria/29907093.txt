BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of many
disease conditions. These beneficial effects are believed to be mediated by
change in the composition of gut microbiota and modulation of the host immune
responses. However, the available data on the effect of probiotics on these
parameters are quite limited.
METHODS: We studied the composition of fecal microbiota, using 16S rRNA
sequencing, and host immune responses in peripheral blood (plasma cytokine
levels, T cell subsets and in vitro cytokine production after stimulation with
anti-CD3/CD28 antibody or lipopolysaccharide) in a group of 14 healthy women at
three time-points - before and after administration of a probiotic preparation (a
capsule of VSL#3, each containing 112.5 billion freeze-dried bacterial cells
belonging to 8 species, twice a day for 4 weeks), and 4-weeks after
discontinuation of the probiotic administration.
RESULTS: There was no change in the abundance of various bacterial taxa as well
as in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota following administration of the
probiotic, or following its discontinuation. Probiotic administration led to a
reduction in the relative frequency of circulating Th17 cells, and in vitro
production of cytokines in whole-blood cultures in response to lipopolysaccharide
stimulation. However, it had no effect on the relative frequencies of Th1, Th2
and T regulatory cells among circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells, on
plasma cytokine levels and on in vitro production of cytokines by T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that VSL#3 administration did not lead to any changes in
gut flora, but led to a reduction in the frequency of Th17 cells and in the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokine on lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These 
findings suggest that the beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation
in patients with autoimmune and allergic disorders may be related to reduced
production of monocyte-derived cytokines rather than to changes in the
composition of gut microbiota.
