BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has a
mitogenic and motogenic activity for gastric mucosal cells. The aim of this study
is to ascertain the clinical significance of the expression of HGF and its
receptor (c-met) during the course of gastric ulcer healing.
METHODS: Ten patients who underwent endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and
developed acute gastric ulcer and 20 patients with peptic ulcer of the stomach
were enrolled in this study. Tissue samples were serially obtained from both the 
edge of the ulcer and its neighboring mucosa 0, 2, and 8 weeks after EMR or
diagnosis. Gene expression of HGF, c-met, c-myc, and proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) was semiquantitatively examined by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using beta-actin as an internal control. In
addition, expression of HGF and c-met mRNA with regard to the presence or absence
of Helicobacter pylori infection was studied.
RESULTS: In patients after EMR HGF, c-met, c-myc, and PCNA mRNA in the ulcer
lesion at 0 week was at the peak of its expression and then decreased with time
(P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively). In patients who
underwent EMR the intensity of HGF mRNA was correlated with that of c-met, c-myc,
and PCNA mRNA (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0095, and P = 0.0009, respectively) and that of 
c-met mRNA was correlated with that of c-myc and PCNA mRNA (P = 0.012 and P <
0.0001, respectively). In patients with peptic ulcer, expression of HGF mRNA
decreased with time (0 week versus 8 weeks, P < 0.05; 0 week versus 8 weeks, P < 
0.01). c-Met expression was lower at 8 weeks than at 0 week (P < 0.05). The
intensity of c-met mRNA was correlated with that of PCNA mRNA (P < 0.0001). H.
pyiori-infected mucosa had a higher level of HGF mRNA than non-infected mucosa.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that HGF is one of the growth factors
acting together during healing of gastric ulcer.
