BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) comprise one of the BM stromal cells 
that are known to support hematopoiesis. It has also been suggested recently that
MSC display immunosuppressive capacities through inhibiting the differentiation
of monocyte-derived DC. DC travel to the lymph nodes (LN) to present Ag to T
cells, and CCL21 is the chemokine that plays an important role in DC migration
into the T-cell area of LN. We addressed the effect of MSC on this chemotactic
activity of DC, one of the typical characteristics upon maturation.
METHODS: BM cells were isolated and then cultured for generation of myeloid DC in
the presence of GM-CSF and/or lipopolysaccharide with or without MSC. MSC were
identified by flow cytometry of the immunologic markers and by performing
colony-forming unit fibroblast assay. Migration of DC was observed with a newly
developed time-lapse video microscopic technique.
RESULTS: MSC co-culture inhibited the initial differentiation of DC, as well as
their maturation. The matured DC actively migrated directionally in response to
CCL21, a powerful DC-attracting chemokine, whereas the MSC co-cultured DC did
not.
DISCUSSION: Collectively, the findings of these experiments raise the possibility
that MSC suppress the migratory function of DC and so they may serve
immunoregulatory activities through the modulation of the Ag-presenting function 
of DC.
