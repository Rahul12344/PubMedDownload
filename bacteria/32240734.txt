T cell receptor (TCR)-like antibodies, obtained with the use of phage display
technology, sandwich the best of the both arms of the adaptive immune system. In 
this study, in vitro selections against the latency associated Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) heat shock protein 16 kDa antigen (16 kDa) presented by
HLA-A*011 and HLA-A*24 were carried out with the use of a human domain phage
antibody library. TCR-like domain antibodies (A11Ab and A24Ab) were successfully 
generated recognizing 16 kDa epitopes presented by HLA-A*011 and HLA-A*24
molecules respectively. Both antibodies were found to be functional in soluble
form and exhibited strong binding capacity against its targets. The results
obtained support the future evaluation of these ligands for the development of
diagnostic and therapeutic tools for tuberculosis infection.
