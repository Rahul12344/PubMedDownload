Phylogenomic reconstruction of archaeal fatty acid metabolism.

Dibrova DV, Galperin MY, Mulkidjanian AY.

While certain archaea appear to synthesize and/or metabolize fatty acids, the
respective pathways still remain obscure. By analysing the genomic distribution
of the key lipid-related enzymes, we were able to identify the likely components 
of the archaeal pathway of fatty acid metabolism, namely, a combination of the
enzymes of bacterial-type β-oxidation of fatty acids [acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase] with
paralogs of the archaeal acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase, an enzyme of the
mevalonate biosynthesis pathway. These three β-oxidation enzymes working in the
reverse direction could potentially catalyse biosynthesis of fatty acids, with
paralogs of acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase performing addition of C2 fragments.
The presence in archaea of the genes for energy-transducing membrane enzyme
complexes, such as cytochrome bc complex, cytochrome c oxidase and diverse
rhodopsins, was found to correlate with the presence of the proposed system of
fatty acid biosynthesis. We speculate that because these membrane complexes
functionally depend on fatty acid chains, their genes could have been acquired
via lateral gene transfer from bacteria only by those archaea that already
possessed a system of fatty acid biosynthesis. The proposed pathway of archaeal
fatty acid metabolism operates in extreme conditions and therefore might be of
interest in the context of biofuel production and other industrial applications.
