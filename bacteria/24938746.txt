Regulatory B (Breg) cells are known to modulate immune responses through
predominantly interleukin-10 (IL-10)-dependent mechanisms and can be
hypothetically divided into innate and adaptive subsets based on the nature of
their activating signals. However, the specific role of different Breg subsets in
modulating immune responses remains ambiguous. Here we have shown that Chlamydia 
induces IL-10-producing splenic B-cell populations consisting of CD43(+) and
CD43(-) subsets of IgM(hi)IgD(lo) innate-like B (ILB) cells in vitro. While
CD43(+)IL-10-producing B cells displayed innate type features and were readily
induced by Chlamydia via Toll-like-receptor (TLR) signaling,
CD43(-)IL-10-producing B cells required additional B-cell activating factor
(BAFF)-mediated signals from dendritic cells (DCs) for their differentiation and 
activation, thereby classifying them as adaptive type Bregs. Importantly,
CD43(-), but not CD43(+), IL-10-producing ILB cells displayed bona fide Breg
activity by potently suppressing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in vitro in an
IL-10-dependent manner. Furthermore, a novel CD43(-)CD1d(hi)CD5(+)
IL-10-producing Breg population was predominantly induced by Chlamydia genital
infection in vivo. Correspondingly, mixed bone marrow chimeric mice with
B-cell-specific IL-10 deficiency exhibited significantly increased type 1 immune 
responses, decreased bacterial burden, and reduced oviduct pathology upon
infection. Our data demonstrate for the first time a distinct role for
CD43(-)CD1d(hi)CD5(+)-adaptive Bregs over CD43(+) innate counterparts in
controlling mucosal responses against intracellular bacterial infection.
