Screening for circumventors of β-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) led us to find 17 novel antibiotics, naphthacemycins
A1-A11, B1-B4 and C1-C2. The naphthacemycins were isolated from a cultured broth 
of Streptomyces sp. KB-3346-5 by repeated silica gel column chromatography and
HPLC. Naphthacemycins enhanced imipenem activity 100-500 times against MRSA at
0.5 μg ml-1, and naphthacemycins A4-A11 themselves showed MIC50 values of
1-4 μg ml-1 against 22 MRSA strains.
