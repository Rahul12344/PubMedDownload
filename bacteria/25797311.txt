The symbiosis of Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 with its host plant Aeschynomene indica
relies on a Nod-factor independent mechanism, wherein the Bradyrhizobium
O-antigen is regarded as a key factor. This O-antigen polysaccharide is composed 
of a unique C10 monosaccharide, namely bradyrhizose, which has a
galactose-inositol trans-fused scaffold, via a homogeneous α-(1 → 7)-linkage.
Herein, we report the first synthesis of bradyrhizose. The scalable synthesis
requires 26 steps in a high overall yield of 9%, with the inositol scaffold being
constructed effectively via a Ferrier II rearrangement from a fully
functionalized C2 and C4 branched pyranose derivative.
