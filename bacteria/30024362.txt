A novel Gram-stain-negative bacterium, designated as type strain 68T, was
isolated from domestic sewage in Tianjin, China. Cells of strain 68T were
aerobic, motile and rod-shaped. The organism grew at 15-42 °C, pH 6.0-11.0 and
with 0-4 % NaCl (w/v). The DNA G+C content was 61.9 mol%. The major fatty acids
(>10 %) were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c or
C16 : 1ω6c), C16 : 0 and C12 : 0. The respiratory quinone was Q9. The major polar
lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminophospholipid. Phylogenetic
analysis based on full 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 68T was a
member of the genus Pseudomonas and showed similarities to Pseudomonas
toyotomiensis HT-3T (98.58 %), Pseudomonas chengduensis MBRT (98.53 %),
Pseudomonas alcaliphila AL15-21T (98.44 %), Pseudomonas composti C2T (97.75 %)
and Pseudomonas anguilliseptica NCIMB 1949T (97.66 %). Strain 68T exhibited low
DNA-DNA hybridization homology with P. alcaliphila AL15-21T (35.40 %), P.
toyotomiensis HT-3T (33.30 %), P. chengduensis MBRT (35.40 %), P. anguilliseptica
NCIMB 1949T (14.40 %) and P. composti C2T (20.40 %). On the basis of phenotypic, 
genotypic and phylogenetic evidence, strain 68T is considered to represent a
novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas
tainjinensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 68T (=CICC 24204T=KCTC
52977T).
