Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) generally occurs in association with
staphylococcal infection. We present the first reported case of IgA-dominant PIGN
after Escherichia coli infection in a renal-transplant recipient. A 65-year-old
patient with stable allograft function and E. coli urosepsis was treated with
ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks with excellent response. One week later he developed
proteinuria 16 g/day. Renal biopsy finding revealed IgA-dominant PIGN. He
received steroid pulses and intravenous imunoglobulins without effect and had
started with hemodialysis.
