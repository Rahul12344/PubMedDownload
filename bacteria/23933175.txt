The recent demonstration of a role of Escherichia coli in the development of
invasive carcinoma in mice ushers a new era of bacterial involvement in cancer
etiology. It has been shown previously that the colonic mucosa of colorectal
carcinoma (CRC) is exclusively colonized by intracellular E. coli instead of
extracellular form found in normal colonic mucosa. Surprisingly, the DNA repair
gene MUTYH, which is a homologue of the E. coli gene mutY, is responsible for
CRC. The current paper discusses the potential role of mutY in CRC etiology and
concludes that research in this area can bring together the diverse threads of
the CRC etiology puzzle.
