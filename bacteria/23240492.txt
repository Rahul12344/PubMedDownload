The origin of halitosis comes from the Latin word "halitus" meaning 'breath,
exhaled air', and in the Hungarian terminology it means bad and smelly breath.
The human body emits a number of volatile molecules, which have a peculiar odour.
Their presence is influenced by several factors, such as genetic, nutritional and
psychological factors. Since bad breath belongs to taboo subjects, halitosis can 
often lead to social isolation. To determine the incidence of halitosis, an exact
diagnosis is needed which sometimes predestinates the possible treatment as well.
Investigators estimate the incidence about 50% in the whole population. The
male/female ratio is the same and the incidence is growing with age. The
diagnosis can be genuine halitosis, pseudo halitosis and halitophobia. We can
divide the genuine type into physiological and pathophysiological subtypes. The
cause of the halitosis usually can be found in the oral cavity. The volatile
sulfur compounds (VSC) produced by some of the oral bacteria are responsible for 
its development. Only 10% of the causes are extraoral, mostly inflammation of
airways or gastrointestinal disorders. The judgment of halitosis is based on
three objective methods: the organoleptic, the sulphide monitoring and the gas
cromatography methods. Since the origin of the halitosis is mainly the oral
cavity, dentists should treat them. Beyond the dental treatments the enhancement 
of the oral hygiene, the continuous motivation and monitoring are also very
important, such as the use of tongue cleansing and special anti-malodour rinses.
