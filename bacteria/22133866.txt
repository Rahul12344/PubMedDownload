OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a new diagnostic index (DI) on
the basis of clinical and laboratory findings including serum C-reactive protein 
(CRP) for tuberculous meningitis (TM) and bacterial meningitis (BM).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: During a 7-year period, 96 adult patients with meningitis
(30 with TM and 66 with BM) were studied retrospectively. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was performed to investigate the diagnostic value of clinical
and laboratory parameters as independent predictors on discrimination of
tuberculous from BM patients.
RESULTS: Six features predictive for diagnosis including age, CSF leukocyte
count, PML dominance, length of illness, serum CRP level and blood WBC count were
used. The DI model developed from these features had very high sensitivity and
specificity rates of 100.0 and 95.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and
speciﬁcity rates were 97.4 and 100%, respectively, in microbiologically proven
cases.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that this new DI which consists of simple
clinical and laboratory parameters had the power to discriminate adult patients
with documented tuberculous and BM (excluding Brucella meningitis). It should,
however, be tested in prospective studies.
