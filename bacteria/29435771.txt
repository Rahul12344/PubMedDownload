Spider mites of the genus Tetranychidae are severe crop pests. In the
Mediterranean a few species coexist, but they are difficult to identify based on 
morphological characters. Additionally, spider mites often harbour several
species of endosymbiotic bacteria, which may affect the biology of their hosts.
Here, we propose novel, cost-effective, multiplex diagnostic methods allowing a
quick identification of spider-mite species as well as of the endosymbionts they 
carry. First, we developed, and successfully multiplexed in a single PCR, primers
to identify Tetranychus urticae, T. evansi and T. ludeni, some of the most common
tetranychids found in southwest Europe. Moreover, we demonstrated that this
method allows detecting multiple species in a single pool, even at low
frequencies (up to 1/100), and can be used on entire mites without DNA
extraction. Second, we developed another set of primers to detect spider-mite
endosymbionts, namely Wolbachia, Cardinium and Rickettsia in a multiplex PCR,
along with a generalist spider-mite primer to control for potential failure of
DNA amplification in each PCR. Overall, our method represents a simple,
cost-effective and reliable method to identify spider-mite species and their
symbionts in natural field populations, as well as to detect contaminations in
laboratory rearings. This method may easily be extended to other species.
