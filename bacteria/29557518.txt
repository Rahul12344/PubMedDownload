Bio-based production of industrially important chemicals provides an eco-friendly
alternative to current petrochemical-based processes. Because of the limited
supply of fossil fuel reserves, various technologies utilizing microbial host
strains for the sustainable production of platform chemicals from renewable
biomass have been developed. Corynebacterium glutamicum is a non-pathogenic
industrial microbial species traditionally used for L-glutamate and L-lysine
production. It is a promising species for industrial production of bio-based
chemicals because of its flexible metabolism that allows the utilization of a
broad spectrum of carbon sources and the production of various amino acids.
Classical breeding, systems, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering
approaches have been used to improve its applications, ranging from traditional
amino-acid production to modern biorefinery systems for production of value-added
platform chemicals. This review describes recent advances in the development of
genetic engineering tools and techniques for the establishment and optimization
of metabolic pathways for bio-based production of major C2-C6 platform chemicals 
using recombinant C. glutamicum.
