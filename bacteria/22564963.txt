OBJECTIVE: Melioidosis is a frequent cause of severe sepsis in Southeast Asia
caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Patients with
melioidosis have elevated circulating levels of tissue-type plasminogen
activator, an important regulator of fibrinolysis. In this study, we aimed to
investigate the role of tissue-type plasminogen activator during melioidosis.
DESIGN: Animal study.
SETTING: University research laboratory.
SUBJECTS: Wild-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator-deficient C57BL/6 mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Mice were intranasally infected with viable Burkholderia
pseudomallei and killed after 24, 48, or 72 hrs for harvesting of lungs, liver,
and blood. Additionally, survival studies were performed.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Experimentally induced melioidosis was associated 
with elevated levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator in lungs of infected
wild-type mice. During infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, tissue-type
plasminogen activator-deficient mice were protected when compared to wild-type
mice as demonstrated by a strongly decreased mortality (62% vs. 100% amongst
wild-type mice, p < .0001), together with decreased pulmonary bacterial loads,
less severe histopathological scores, and decreased fibrinolysis. These results
were accompanied with an early increase in cytokine levels in tissue-type
plasminogen activator-deficient mice.
CONCLUSIONS: During severe gram-negative sepsis caused by Burkholderia
pseudomallei, endogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator has harmful effects
with respect to survival and pulmonary bacterial growth. These effects are
related to tissue-type plasminogen activator-associated plasmin-induced
fibrinolysis and/or a tissue-type plasminogen activator-associated decrease in
proinflammatory cytokine production.
