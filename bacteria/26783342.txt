HLA class I-binding predictions are widely used to identify candidate peptide
targets of human CD8(+) T cell responses. Many such approaches focus exclusively 
on a limited range of peptide lengths, typically 9 aa and sometimes 9-10 aa,
despite multiple examples of dominant epitopes of other lengths. In this study,
we examined whether epitope predictions can be improved by incorporating the
natural length distribution of HLA class I ligands. We found that, although
different HLA alleles have diverse length-binding preferences, the length
profiles of ligands that are naturally presented by these alleles are much more
homogeneous. We hypothesized that this is due to a defined length profile of
peptides available for HLA binding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on this,
we created a model of HLA allele-specific ligand length profiles and demonstrate 
how this model, in combination with HLA-binding predictions, greatly improves
comprehensive identification of CD8(+) T cell epitopes.
