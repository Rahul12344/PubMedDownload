Empyema of the gallbladder: a complication in the natural history of acute
cholecystitis.

Fry DE, Cox RA, Harbrecht PJ.

Empyema of the gallbladder was identified in 34 patients. Patients undergoing
early operation without attempts at nonoperative treatment had less infectious
morbidity and mortality. Delayed operative intervention, extrabiliary abscess,
perforation of the gallbladder and common duct exploration are factors that
contribute to increased risks in these patients.
