Immune responses to Chlamydia trachomatis contribute to protection from infection
and to immunopathologic disease. To test whether subjects' HLA class I (A, B, and
Cw) or class II (DRbeta1 and DQbeta1) types influence risk of trachomatous
scarring from chronic infection with C trachomatis, 153 cases and pair-matched
controls in Gambia were studied. No HLA type was associated with protection from 
scarring, indicating that protective immune responses are not limited to only one
or a few HLA-restricted epitopes in C. trachomatis antigens. One class I antigen,
HLA-A28, was significantly more common among cases than controls (25.8% vs.
15.9%, respectively; McNemar's odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 1.01-3.49; P = .046). In DNA subtyping of the A28 specificity, the A*6801 
allele was equally common among cases and controls, but the A*6802 allele was
significantly overrepresented among cases (McNemar's OR, 3.14; 95% CI =
1.32-7.44; P = .009). This association may be due to an immunopathologic
HLA-A*6802-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.
