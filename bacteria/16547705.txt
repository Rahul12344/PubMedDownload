Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer and the second
leading cancer-related death among men in the Western civilization. Since no
effective therapy exists for this tumor after progression beyond resectable
boundaries, there is an urgent need for new treatment strategies. Prostate
specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents an excellent target on prostate
cancer cells, and therefore specific immunotherapy may be a novel therapeutic
option for the management of this tumor. We constructed a fully recombinant
immunotoxin (A5-PE40) from a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) against
cell-adherent PSMA and a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE40) lacking 
its natural binding domain Ia. The scFv A5 was obtained from a mAb elicited with 
native PSMA by phage display technology and direct selection on cells carrying
the antigen. The bacterially expressed and purified immunotoxin A5-PE40
specifically binds to PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells and induces a 50%
reduction of viability (IC50) at a concentration of 20 pM, while PSMA-negative
cells remain unaffected. Due to its high and specific toxicity this recombinant
immunotoxin is a promising candidate for therapeutic applications in patients
with prostate cancer.
