The aim of this study was to investigate whether the newly synthesized
bisphosphonic acid-linked N-Lost derivative BAD retains bone-seeking and
cytostatic properties. The paper describes experiments on mutagenicity in vitro
and on toxicity in vivo. BAD is characterized by very low mutagenic activity
toward histidine auxotrophic Salmonella typhimurium strains. Cytotoxic effects
were tested in rat osteosarcoma and in Walker carcinosarcoma 256B. The LD50 of
i.v. injected BAD was 146 mg/kg. Acute toxicity is probably caused by calcium
complexing of the bisphosphonate part of the molecule. Labeling experiments
showed moderate accumulation in bone and osteosarcoma, as well as in lung
metastases. BAD effected high tumor growth inhibition in osteosarcoma and Walker 
carcinosarcoma-bearing rats and marked prolongation of survival; histologic and
radiographic examination revealed rapid calcification of osteosarcoma and lung
metastases. BAD-pretreatment produced protective effects against osteolysis
induced by intratibially implanted Walker carcinosarcoma ascites cells. The
cytostatic efficacy of equitoxic doses of BAD in rat osteosarcoma is comparable
to that of dacarbazine and in Walker carcinosarcoma to that of melphalan.
