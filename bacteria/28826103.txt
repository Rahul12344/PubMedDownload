Studies of the molecular determinants of coenzyme specificity help to reveal the 
structure-function relationship of enzymes, especially with regards to coenzyme
specificity-determining sites (CSDSs) that usually mediate complex interactions. 
NADP(H)-dependent 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Clostridium absonum (CA
7α-HSDH), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (SDRs),
possesses positively charged CSDSs that mainly contain T15, R16, R38, and R194,
forming complicated polar interactions with the adenosine ribose C2 phosphate
group of NADP(H). The R38 residue is crucial for coenzyme anchoring, but the
influence of the other residues on coenzyme utilization is still not clear.
Hence, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis and molecular dynamic (MD)
simulations. The results suggest that the natural CSDSs have the greatest
NADP(H)-binding affinity, but not the best activity (kcat) toward NADP+. Compared
with the wild type and other mutants, the mutant R194A showed the highest
catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), which was more than three-times that of the wild 
type. MD simulation and kinetics analysis suggested that the importance of the
CSDSs of CA 7α-HSDH should be in accordance with the following order
R38>T15>R16>R194, and S39 may have a supporting role in NADP(H) anchoring for
mutants R16A/T194A and T15A/R16A/T194A.
