Nano-scale zero-valent iron (nZVI) has been conceived for cost-efficient
degradation of chlorinated pollutants in soil as an alternative to e.g permeable 
reactive barriers or excavation. Little is however known about its efficiency in 
degradation of the ubiquitous environmental pollutant DDT and its secondary
effects on organisms. Here, two types of nZVI (type B made using precipitation
with borohydride, and type T produced by gas phase reduction of iron oxides under
H2) were compared for efficiency in degradation of DDT in water and in a
historically (>45 years) contaminated soil (24 mg kg(-1) DDT). Further, the
ecotoxicity of soil and water was tested on plants (barley and flax), earthworms 
(Eisenia fetida), ostracods (Heterocypris incongruens), and bacteria (Escherichia
coli). Both types of nZVI effectively degraded DDT in water, but showed lower
degradation of aged DDT in soil. Both types of nZVI had negative impact on the
tested organisms, with nZVI-T giving least adverse effects. Negative effects were
mostly due to oxidation of nZVI, resulting in O2 consumption and excess Fe(II) in
water and soil.
