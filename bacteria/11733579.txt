The factors regulating growth and patterning of the spleen are poorly defined. We
demonstrate here that spleens from B cell-deficient mice have 10-fold reduced
expression of the T zone chemokine, CCL21, a threefold reduction in T cell and
dendritic cell (DC) numbers, and reduced expression of the T zone stromal marker,
gp38. Using cell transfer and receptor blocking approaches, we provide evidence
that B cells play a critical role in the early postnatal development of the
splenic T zone. This process involves B cell expression of lymphotoxin
(LT)alpha1beta2, a cytokine that is required for expression of CCL21 and gp38.
Introduction of a B cell specific LTalpha transgene on to the LTalpha-deficient
background restored splenic CCL21 and gp38 expression, DC numbers, and T zone
size. This work also demonstrates that the role of B cells in T zone development 
is distinct from the effect of B cells on splenic T cell numbers, which does not 
require LTalpha1beta2. Therefore, B cells influence spleen T zone development by 
providing: (a) signals that promote T cell accumulation, and: (b) signals,
including LTalpha1beta2, that promote stromal cell development and DC
accumulation. Defects in these parameters may contribute to the immune defects
associated with B cell deficiency in mice and humans.
