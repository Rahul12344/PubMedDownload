T cell receptor recognition of antigen can lead either to T lymphocyte
differentiation and proliferation or to a state of unresponsiveness, which is
dependent on whether appropriate costimulatory signals are provided to the mature
T cell. We have investigated a novel intracellular signaling pathway provided by 
the costimulatory molecule CD28. CD28 engagement triggers the activation of an
acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase), which results in the generation of ceramide,
an important lipid messenger intermediate. A-SMase activation by CD28 occurred in
resting as well as in activated primary T cells or leukemic Jurkat cells. In
contrast, ligation of either CD3 or CD2 did not result in A-SMase activation.
Overexpression of recombinant A-SMase in Jurkat T cells substituted for CD28 with
regard to nuclear factor-kB activation. These data suggest that CD28 provides an 
important costimulatory signal by activation of an acidic sphingomyelinase
pathway.
