BACKGROUND:   Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram negative bacterium that
can cause diseases such as peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. IL-17A, a
proinflammatory cytokine that can induce the production of CXC chemokines for
neutrophil recruitment, has recently been shown to be elevated in both H.
pylori-infected patients and mice. Furthermore, studies in mouse models of
vaccination have reported levels significantly increased over infected,
unimmunized mice and blocking of IL-17A during the challenge phase in immunized
mice reduces protective immunity. Because many aspects of immunity had redundant 
or compensatory mechanisms, we investigated whether mice could be protectively
immunized when IL-17A function is absent during the entire immune response using 
IL-17A and IL-17A receptor knockout (KO) mice immunized against H. pylori.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:   Gastric biopsies were harvested from naïve,
unimmunized/challenged, and immunized/challenged wild type (WT) and KO mice and
analyzed for inflammation, neutrophil, and bacterial levels. Groups of IL-17A KO 
mice were also treated with anti-IFNγ or control antibodies.
RESULTS:   Surprisingly, all groups of immunized KO mice reduced their bacterial 
loads comparably to WT mice. The gastric neutrophil counts did not vary
significantly between IL-17A KO and WT mice, whereas IL-17RA KO mice had on
average a four-fold decrease compared to WT. Additionally, we performed an
immunization study with CXCR2 KO mice and observed significant gastric
neutrophils and reduction in bacterial load.
CONCLUSION:   These data suggest that there are compensatory mechanisms for
protection against H. pylori and for neutrophil recruitment in the absence of an 
IL-17A-CXC chemokine pathway.
