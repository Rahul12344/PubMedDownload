Background: Sequence type 131 (ST131) of Escherichia coli is a pandemic clone
that drives the increasing rates of antibiotic resistance. While the
pervasiveness of ST131 clade C, especially subclades C2 and C1-M27, has been
demonstrated in numerous global surveys, no report about the ST131 clades and
their virotypes has been published from Iran so far.
Methods: A collection of 73 consecutive ST131 isolates from extraintestinal
specimens was investigated for determination of virotypes, antibiotic
susceptibility patterns, resistance/virulence determinants, and clade subsets.
Results: Most of the isolates belonged to subclade C2 (33/73; 45.2%), which had
the highest virulence factor (VF) scores and resistance rates, followed by C1-M27
(18; 24.6%), C1-non-M27 (14; 19.1%), and A (8; 10.9%). The distinctive profiles
of subclade C2 virulence genes were revealed by principle coordinates analysis
testing. The distribution of the hlyA virulence gene among subclade C2 was not
uniform, so that positive strains (21; 63.6%) showed significantly higher rates
of resistance (bla CTX-M-15, bla OXA-1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, aac(6')-Ib, aac(3)-IIa)
and virulence (hra, tia/hek, K5, cnf, papGII, papC) markers and
gentamicin/tobramycin resistance. Virotype C as the most common virotype (34;
46.5%) was predominant among the subclade C1 population, while virotypes E and F 
(21; 28.7%) were detected among subclade C2, which had the highest VF scores and 
aminoglycoside resistance rates.
Conclusions: The appearance of virotypes E and F among subclade C2 strains with
higher rates of aminoglycoside resistance/virulence gene content shows the
shifting dynamics of this pandemic clone in response to antibiotic selection
pressure by establishing subsets with higher survival potential.
