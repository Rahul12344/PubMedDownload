Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a member of the sliding clamp family
of proteins, interacts specifically with DNA replication and repair proteins
through a small peptide motif called the PCNA-interacting protein or PIP box.
PCNA is recognized as one of the key proteins involved in DNA metabolism. In the 
present study, the recombinant PCNA from Litopenaeus vannamei (LvPCNA) was
heterologously overexpressed and purified using metal ion-affinity
chromatography. Crystals suitable for diffraction grew overnight using the
hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. LvPCNA crystals belong to space group C2
with unit-cell parameters a=144.6, b=83.4, c=74.3 Å, β=117.6°. One data set was
processed to 3 Å resolution, with an overall Rmeas of 0.09 and a completeness of 
93.3%. Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using a homology
model of LvPCNA as the search model. Refinement and structural analysis are
underway. This report is the first successful crystallographic analysis of a
marine crustacean decapod shrimp (L. vannamei) proliferating cell nuclear
antigen.
