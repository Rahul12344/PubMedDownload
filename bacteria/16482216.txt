The virulence factor IpgD, delivered into nonphagocytic cells by the type III
secretion system of the pathogen Shigella flexneri, is a phosphoinositide
4-phosphatase generating phosphatidylinositol 5 monophosphate (PtdIns5P). We show
that PtdIns5P is rapidly produced and concentrated at the entry foci of the
bacteria, where it colocalises with phosphorylated Akt during the first steps of 
infection. Moreover, S. flexneri-induced phosphorylation of host cell Akt and its
targets specifically requires IpgD. Ectopic expression of IpgD in various cell
types, but not of its inactive mutant, or addition of short-chain penetrating
PtdIns5P is sufficient to induce Akt phosphorylation. Conversely, sequestration
of PtdIns5P or reduction of its level strongly decreases Akt phosphorylation in
infected cells or in IpgD-expressing cells. Accordingly, IpgD and PtdIns5P
production specifically activates a class IA PI 3-kinase via a mechanism
involving tyrosine phosphorylations. Thus, S. flexneri parasitism is shedding
light onto a new mechanism of PI 3-kinase/Akt activation via PtdIns5P production 
that plays an important role in host cell responses such as survival.
