Several genes, including ADAM33, DPP10, PHF11, GPRA, and TIM-1, have been
implicated in the pathogenesis and susceptibility to atopy and asthma. Advances
have been made in defining the mechanism for the control of allergic airway
inflammation in response to inhaled antigens. There is growing evidence that
associates asthma with a systemic propensity for allergic type 2 T-cell
cytokines. Disordered coagulation and fibrinolysis could also exacerbate asthma
symptoms. Major emphasis on immunotherapy for asthma during the past decade has
been to direct the immune response to a type 1 response. Recent literature
supports the pivotal role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and allergen-specific
T-regulatory cells in the development of tolerance to allergens. In this review
article, we discuss the current information on the pathogenesis of allergic
airway inflammation and potential allergen immunotherapies, which could be
beneficial in the treatment of airway inflammation, allergy, and asthma.
