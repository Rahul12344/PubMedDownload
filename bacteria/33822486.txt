BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin ligases or E3 ligases are well programmed to regulate
molecular interactions that operate at a post-translational level. Skp, Cullin,
F-box containing complex (or SCF complex) is a multidomain E3 ligase known to
mediate the degradation of a wide range of proteins through the proteasomal
pathway. The three-dimensional domain architecture of SCF family proteins
suggests that it operates through a novel and adaptable "super-enzymatic" process
that might respond to targeted therapeutic modalities in cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several F-box containing proteins have been characterized either
as tumor suppressors (FBXW8, FBXL3, FBXW8, FBXL3, FBXO1, FBXO4, and FBXO18) or as
oncogenes (FBXO5, FBXO9, and SKP2). Besides, F-box members like βTrcP1 and
βTrcP2, the ones with context-dependent functionality, have also been studied and
reported. FBXW7 is a well-studied F-box protein and is a tumor suppressor. FBXW7 
regulates the activity of a range of substrates, such as c-Myc, cyclin E, mTOR,
c-Jun, NOTCH, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), AURKA, NOTCH through the
well-known ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation pathway. NOTCH 
signaling is a primitive pathway that plays a crucial role in maintaining normal 
tissue homeostasis. FBXW7 regulates NOTCH protein activity by controlling its
half-life, thereby maintaining optimum protein levels in tissue. However,
aberrations in the FBXW7 or NOTCH expression levels can lead to poor prognosis
and detrimental outcomes in patients. Therefore, the FBXW7-NOTCH axis has been a 
subject of intense study and research over the years, especially around the
interactome's role in driving cancer development and progression. Several studies
have reported the effect of FBXW7 and NOTCH mutations on normal tissue behavior. 
The current review attempts to critically analyze these mutations prognostic
value in a wide range of tumors. Furthermore, the review summarizes the recent
findings pertaining to the FBXW7 and NOTCH interactome and its involvement in
phosphorylation-related events, cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The review concludes by positioning FBXW7 as an effective diagnostic 
marker in tumors and by listing out recent advancements made in cancer
therapeutics in identifying protocols targeting the FBXW7-NOTCH aberrations in
tumors.
