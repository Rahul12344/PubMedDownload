BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.
Tissue repair after pathological injury in the heart remains a major challenge
due to the limited regenerative ability of cardiomyocytes in adults. Stem
cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a promising source for the cell
transplantation-based treatment of injured hearts.
AIM: To explore the function and mechanisms of miR-301a in regulating
cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, and provide
experimental evidence for applying miR-301a to the cardiomyocyte differentiation 
induction from stem cells.
METHODS: mES cells with or without overexpression of miR-301a were applied for
all functional assays. The hanging drop technique was applied to form embryoid
bodies from mES cells. Cardiac markers including GATA-4, TBX5, MEF2C, and
α-actinin were used to determine cardiomyocyte differentiation from mES cells.
RESULTS: High expression of miR-301a was detected in the heart from late
embryonic to neonatal mice. Overexpression of miR-301a in mES cells significantly
induced the expression of cardiac transcription factors, thereby promoting
cardiomyocyte differentiation and beating cardiomyocyte clone formation. PTEN is 
a target gene of miR-301a in cardiomyocytes. PTEN-regulated PI3K-AKT-mTOR-Stat3
signaling showed involvement in regulating miR-301a-promoted cardiomyocyte
differentiation from mES cells.
CONCLUSION: MiR-301a is capable of promoting embryonic stem cell differentiation 
to cardiomyocytes.
