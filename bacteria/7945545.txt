Twenty-one derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline (oxine, 8H, CAS 148-24-3) were
prepared and characterized by UV, IR, MS and NMR spectroscopy. Four of these
derivatives, N-butyl, 8-butyloxyquinolinium bromide (HBD), 8-pentyloxyquinoline
(HPEM), N-pentyl, 8-pentyloxyquinolinium bromide (HPED) and N-benzyl, 8-benzyloxy
quinolinium chloride (HBED) are new and reported for the first time. The
antimicrobial activity of these compounds was carried out in vitro against 11
Gram positive and 18 Gram negative bacteria, and 18 fungi including 9
dermatophytes, 7 other filamentous fungi and 2 Candida species. Three compounds
namely, HPRD, HPED and HBED were found to possess significant antibacterial
activity in order of HPED > HPRD > HBED, whereas 4 were found to possess
significant antifungal activity in order of 8H > HT > HPEM > 8B.
