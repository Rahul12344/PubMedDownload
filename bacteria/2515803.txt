Microcystis strains (2 toxic and 18 nontoxic to mice) were isolated from toxic
waterblooms that had been collected from Lake Kasumigaura, Ibaraki Prefecture,
Japan, in August 1985. Thirteen of the strains (2 toxic and 11 nontoxic) were
Microcystis aeruginosa, 2 (nontoxic) were Microcystis wesenbergii, and the other 
5 were difficult to identify. Six (1 toxic and 4 nontoxic M. aeruginosa and 1 M. 
wesenbergii) of these 20 strains were established as axenic cultures. A toxic and
axenic strain of M. aeruginosa, K-139, was used to study the relationship between
growth conditions and toxicity. Cells in early-to-mid-log phase showed the
highest toxicity (50% lethal dose, 7.5 mg of cells per kg of mouse), and maximum 
toxicity was not affected by growth temperatures between 22 and 30 degrees C.
Purification and characterization of the toxins from K-139 cells were also
conducted, and at least two toxins were detected. One of the toxins (molecular
mass, 980 daltons) has not been reported previously. The main target of the toxin
in mice was the liver. Marked congestion and necrosis in the parenchymal cells
around the central veins of the liver were observed microscopically in specimens 
that had been prepared from the mice with acute toxicity after injection with the
toxin.
