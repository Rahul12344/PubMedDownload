from patients with common variable immunodeficiency.

The patients included in this study belong to a subset of common variable
immunodeficiency (CVID) patients whose peripheral blood T cells have a T cell
receptor (TCR)-mediated activation defect leading to impaired expression of the
interleukin (IL)-2 gene upon stimulation with recall antigens (tetanus toxoid,
Escherichia coli) or superantigens (staphylococcal enterotoxins). In the present 
report we demonstrate that the patients' peripheral blood T cells failed to
generate the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)
following stimulation with superantigen or mAb specific for the monomorphic
region of the TCR beta-chain. Patients' T cell lines were also impaired in
generating Ins(1,4,5)P3 when stimulated with tetanus toxoid-pulsed autologous
monocytes. Addition of a second or third co-stimulatory signal provided by
recombinant IL-2, CD28 or both had no effect on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation of the
patients' antigen-driven T cell lines. The T cell activation defect, however, was
not absolute, as Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation in the patients' T cells after
phytohemagglutinin or aluminium fluoride stimulation was normal. The impairment
in signal transduction via the T cell antigen receptor was limited to the
patients' T cells, as no activation defect after ligation of surface
immunoglobulin, the antigen receptor on B cells, could be detected.
