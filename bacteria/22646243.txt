We report a case of disseminated blastomycosis in a female resident of Delhi, who
acquired the infection during travel to the USA, which was successfully treated
with oral itraconazole. In addition, we present a critical literature review,
indicating that blastomycosis is endemic in India but its areas of endemicity,
prevalence, and the natural habitat of the etiologic agent, remain undetermined. 
The diagnosis of blastomycosis was made by examination of Gomori's methenamine
silver stained sections of tissue obtained from a biopsy of a subcutaneous,
abdominal nodular. These studies revealed thick-walled, broad-based budding yeast
cells compatible with Blastomyces dermatitidis, and consistent with the isolation
of the fungus in cultures inoculated with posterior auricular lymph node
aspirate. Microscopically, the isolate had thin, septate hyphae and
characteristic spherical to pyriform, smooth-walled microconidia. Its identity
was confirmed by conversion to its typical yeast form on pea seed agar at 37Â°C
and by DNA sequencing of ITS and BAD 1 promoter regions.
