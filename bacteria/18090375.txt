OBJECTIVE: Alveolar fibrin deposition is a hallmark of pneumonia. It has been
proposed that natural inhibitors of coagulation, including activated protein C,
antithrombin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, exert lung-protective effects 
via anticoagulant and possibly anti-inflammatory pathways. We investigated the
role of these natural anticoagulants in Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia.
DESIGN: A controlled in vivo laboratory study.
SETTING: Research laboratory of a university hospital.
SUBJECTS: Total of 98 male Sprague-Dawley rats.
INTERVENTIONS: Rats were challenged intratracheally with S. pneumoniae (serotype 
3, 10(6) colony forming units), inducing pneumonia. Rats were randomized to
intravenous treatment with normal saline, activated protein C, antithrombin,
tissue factor pathway inhibitor, heparin, or tissue-type plasminogen activator.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rats infected with S. pneumoniae had increased
thrombin-antithrombin complexes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, with decreased
levels of antithrombin activity and fibrin degradation products. Administration
of activated protein C, antithrombin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor
significantly limited these procoagulant changes. Furthermore, antithrombin
treatment resulted in less bacterial outgrowth of S. pneumoniae and less
histopathologic damage in lungs.
CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant treatment attenuates pulmonary coagulopathy during S. 
pneumoniae pneumonia. Antithrombin seems to exert significant lung-protective
effects in pneumococcal pneumonia in rats.
