L-Amino acid ligase synthesizes various peptides from unprotected L-amino acids
in an ATP-dependent manner. Known L-amino acid ligases catalyze only dipeptide
synthesis, but recently we found that RizB of Bacillus subtilis NBRC 3134
catalyzes oligopeptide synthesis. In the present study, we searched for new
members of the L-amino acid ligase group that catalyze oligopeptide synthesis.
Several hypothetical proteins possessing the ATP-grasp motif were selected by in 
silico analysis. These recombinant proteins were assayed for L-amino acid ligase 
activity. We obtained five L-amino acid ligases showing oligopeptide synthesis
activities. These proteins showed low similarity in amino acid sequence, but
commonly used branched-chain amino acids, such as RizB, as substrates.
Furthermore, the spr0969 protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae synthesized longer
peptides than those synthesized by RizB, and the BAD_1200 protein of
Bifidobacterium adolescentis showed higher activity toward aromatic amino acids
than toward branched-chain ones. We also examined some of their characteristics.
