Commensal gut microflora and dietary fiber protect against colonic inflammation
and colon cancer through unknown targets. Butyrate, a bacterial product from
fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon, has been implicated in this process. 
GPR109A (encoded by Niacr1) is a receptor for butyrate in the colon. GPR109A is
also a receptor for niacin, which is also produced by gut microbiota and
suppresses intestinal inflammation. Here we showed that Gpr109a signaling
promoted anti-inflammatory properties in colonic macrophages and dendritic cells 
and enabled them to induce differentiation of Treg cells and IL-10-producing T
cells. Moreover, Gpr109a was essential for butyrate-mediated induction of IL-18
in colonic epithelium. Consequently, Niacr1(-/-) mice were susceptible to
development of colonic inflammation and colon cancer. Niacin, a pharmacological
Gpr109a agonist, suppressed colitis and colon cancer in a Gpr109a-dependent
manner. Thus, Gpr10a has an essential role in mediating the beneficial effects of
gut microbiota and dietary fiber in colon.
