We recently reported that TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)3, a ubiquitously
expressed adaptor protein, promotes mature B cell apoptosis. However, the
specific function of TRAF3 in T cells has remained unclear. In this article, we
report the generation and characterization of T cell-specific TRAF3(-/-) mice, in
which the traf3 gene was deleted from thymocytes and T cells. Ablation of TRAF3
in the T cell lineage did not affect CD4 or CD8 T cell populations in secondary
lymphoid organs or the numbers or proportions of CD4(+),CD8(+) or double-positive
or double-negative thymocytes, except that the T cell-specific TRAF3(-/-) mice
had a 2-fold increase in FoxP3(+) T cells. In striking contrast to mice lacking
TRAF3 in B cells, the T cell TRAF3-deficient mice exhibited defective IgG1
responses to a T-dependent Ag, as well as impaired T cell-mediated immunity to
infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Surprisingly, we found that TRAF3 was
recruited to the TCR/CD28 signaling complex upon costimulation and that
TCR/CD28-mediated proximal and distal signaling events were compromised by TRAF3 
deficiency. These findings provide insights into the roles played by TRAF3 in T
cell activation and T cell-mediated immunity.
