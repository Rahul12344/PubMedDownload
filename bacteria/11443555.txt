CXC chemokines have been implicated in the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of
infection. To determine the role of CXC chemokines in the host response to
urinary tract infection (UTI), female mice were treated with an antibody against 
the major CXC chemokine receptor in the mouse, CXCR2, before intravesical
inoculation with Escherichia coli. Anti-CXCR2 prevented the influx of neutrophils
in urine and kidneys. The absence of a neutrophil response only temporarily
impaired the clearance of bacteria from the urinary tract, as indicated by 100-
and 1000-fold more E. coli colony-forming units in urine and kidneys of
anti-CXCR2-treated mice at 24 h, but not at 48 h, after the infection. UTI
induced increases in the renal concentrations of the CXCR2 ligands macrophage
inflammatory protein-2 and KC, which were not influenced by anti-CXCR2
administration. CXC chemokines play an important role in the development of a
local inflammatory response to UTI.
