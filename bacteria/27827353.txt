A phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase, TkTrpF, from Thermococcus kodakaraensis 
was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. TkTrpF was
crystallized and its structure was determined by molecular replacement in two
different space groups (C2 and P1) using data to 1.85 and 1.75 Å resolution,
respectively. TkTrpF belongs to the class of TIM-barrel proteins. Structural
comparison with other phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerases (TrpFs) showed the
highest structural similarity to Pyrococcus furiosus TrpF. Similarly to P.
furiosus TrpF, TkTrpF is a monomer in solution, in contrast to other thermophilic
enzymes, which exist as functional dimers. Although in space group P1 TkTrpF
crystallizes with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the interface is highly
improbable in solution. Potential factors for the thermostability of TkTrpF were 
attributed to an increase in helical structure, an increased number of charged
residues and an increase in the number of salt bridges.
