BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are released from the plasma membrane of
activated or dying cells and bear surface molecules from those cells. We examined
whether donor-derived MPs in the peripheral blood of the recipient could serve as
a marker of tissue damage due to rejection of a transplanted hand.
METHODS: Platelet-free plasma from the recipient of the transplanted hand was
analyzed for MPs bearing the donor-specific HLA molecule A*02 using flow
cytometry. Rejection status of the transplanted hand was monitored by
histopathology of skin punch biopsies.
RESULTS: Donor-specific MPs expressing HLA A*02 were quantifiable in the
peripheral blood of the recipient. Levels of these MPs increased with worsening
rejection of the transplanted hand.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the ability to detect donor specific MPs 
through staining of graft cell-specific HLA and promote further investigation
into the potential utility of flow cytometry for donor-derived MPs as a
noninvasive tool to assess rejection in solid organ transplantation patients.
