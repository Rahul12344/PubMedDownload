Substrate concentrations greatly influence bacterial growth and metabolism.
However, optimal nitrogen concentrations for anammox bacteria in nitrogen-limited
environments remain unclear. Here, we observed enhanced nitrogen metabolism and
anabolism of anammox bacteria at low-nitrogen conditions. Efficient nitrogen
removal was achieved at ammonium and nitrite influent concentration of 30 mg/L
under HRT of 1h, with an average nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 0.73 kg N/(m3 ·d)
in I-ABR composed of four compartments. The highest anammox activity of 6.25 mmol
N/ (gVSS·h) was observed in the fourth compartment (C4) with the lowest substrate
levels (ammonium and nitrite of 11.6 mg/L and 7 mg/L). This could be resulted
from the highest expression level of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in C4,
which was 1.49-1.67 times higher than that in other compartments. Besides, the
second compartment (C2) exhibited the most active anabolism at ammonium and
nitrite of 17 mg/L and 13 mg/L, respectively, which contributed to the most
active amino acid synthesis and thus the highest EPS (1.35 times higher) in C2.
This enhanced amino acid auxotrophy between anammox bacteria with heterotrophs,
and consequently, heterotrophs thrived and competed for nitrite. These results
hint at the potential application of anammox process in micro-polluted water.
