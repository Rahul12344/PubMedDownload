Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by synovial
inflammation and joint destruction. Previous studies have shown that natural
killer (NK) cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA.
Interleukin (IL)-15, a pro-inflammatory cytokine which induces proliferation and 
differentiation of NK cells, is overexpressed in RA. In this present study, we
examine various NKRs and adhesion molecule expression on NK cells from RA
patients and their response to IL-15 stimulation. We also sought to study
cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells in RA patients. We established that 
1. RA patients had higher NK cell percentages in peripheral blood and their serum
IL-15 levels were higher compared to healthy volunteers; 2. NK cells from RA
patients showed lower NKp46 expression and an impaired CD69 response to IL-15; 3.
NK cells from RA patients showed higher CD158b and CD158e expression but lower
CD62L expression; 4. exogenous IL-15 up-regulated CD69, CD158b, CD158e but
down-regulated NKp46 and CD62L expression in RA; 5. As to CIML NK cells,
restimulation - induced NK cytotoxicity and IFN-Î³ production was impaired in RA
patients, 6. Reduced NKp46, perforin, and granzyme B expression on NK cells was
found in RA patients with bone deformity and erosion, 7. RA disease activity
(DAS28) showed inverse correlation with the percentages of CD56+CD3- NK cells,
and NKp46 and perforin expression on NK cells, respectively. Taken together, our 
study demonstrated differential expression of various NK receptors in RA
patients. NKp46, CD158e, and perforin expression on NK cells may serve as markers
of RA severity.
