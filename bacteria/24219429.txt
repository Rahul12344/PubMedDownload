BACKGROUND: The chemoautotrophic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha can utilize H2/CO2 
for growth under aerobic conditions. While this microbial host has great
potential to be engineered to produce desired compounds (beyond
polyhydroxybutyrate) directly from CO2, little work has been done to develop
genetic part libraries to enable such endeavors.
RESULTS: We report the development of a toolbox for the metabolic engineering of 
Ralstonia eutropha H16. We have constructed a set of broad-host-range plasmids
bearing a variety of origins of replication, promoters, 5' mRNA stem-loop
structures, and ribosomal binding sites. Specifically, we analyzed the origins of
replication pCM62 (IncP), pBBR1, pKT (IncQ), and their variants. We tested the
promoters P(BAD), T7, P(xyls/PM), P(lacUV5), and variants thereof for inducible
expression. We also evaluated a T7 mRNA stem-loop structure sequence and compared
a set of ribosomal binding site (RBS) sequences derived from Escherichia coli, R.
eutropha, and a computational RBS design tool. Finally, we employed the toolbox
to optimize hydrocarbon production in R. eutropha and demonstrated a 6-fold titer
improvement using the appropriate combination of parts.
CONCLUSION: We constructed and evaluated a versatile synthetic biology toolbox
for Ralstonia eutropha metabolic engineering that could apply to other microbial 
hosts as well.
