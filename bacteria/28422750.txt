G protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) was recently highlighted as a colon-homing 
receptor for murine and human CD4+ T cells. The aim of this study was to explore 
the functional phenotype of human GPR15+CD4+ T cells, focusing on Tregs and
effector T cells (Teffs), and to determine whether GPR15 is the driver for the
migration of T cells to the colon during ulcerative colitis (UC). In the
peripheral blood, GPR15 was expressed on Tregs and Teffs; both GPR15+ T cell
subsets produced less IFN-γ and IL-4 but more IL-17 after stimulation and showed 
a higher migration activity compared with GPR15-CD4+ T cells. In UC patients,
GPR15 expression was increased on Tregs in the peripheral blood but not on Teffs.
Interestingly, the expression of GPR15 was significantly enhanced on colonic T
cells of UC patients in noninflamed biopsies but not in inflamed biopsies. The
differential expression of GPR15 in UC patients was accompanied by a significant 
reduction of bacterial immunoregulatory metabolites in the feces. In conclusion, 
GPR15 expression on CD4+ T cells is altered in UC patients, which may have
implications for the development of therapeutic approaches to target T cell
trafficking to the colon.
