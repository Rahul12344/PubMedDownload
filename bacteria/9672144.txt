Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have immunomodulatory functions
and can suppress a number of proinflammatory, monocyte/macrophage-derived
cytokines. Interleukin-12 is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and
macrophages, which plays an essential role in cell mediated immunity and
stimulates the development of T helper type 1 immune responses. In this study, we
investigated the ability of ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril, to suppress
IL-12 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We show that
both ACE inhibitors significantly inhibit production of IL-12 by PBMC stimulated 
with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC).
Although both ACE inhibitors also suppressed IFN-gamma production by human
anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated T-cells, the addition of exogenous IFN-gamma to the
PBMC stimulation medium does not abrogate the ability of ACE inhibitors to
suppress IL-12 production. Inhibition of IL-12 was not associated with inhibition
of IL-1beta, but correlated with the suppression of ACE. Therefore, suppression
of IL-12 may contribute to the immunomodulatory effect of ACE inhibitors and may 
be responsible for the beneficial effect of captopril and other ACE inhibitors in
inflammatory or autoimmune conditions in which IL-12 is involved.
