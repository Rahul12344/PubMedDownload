In spite of antibiotic treatment, pneumococcal meningitis continues to be
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The complement system is a
key component of innate immunity against invading pathogens. However, activation 
of complement is also involved in tissue damage, and complement inhibition by C1 
inhibitor (C1-inh) is beneficial in animal models of endotoxemia and sepsis. In
the present study, we demonstrate classical pathway complement activation during 
pneumococcal meningitis in rats. We also evaluate the effect of C1-inh treatment 
on clinical illness, bacterial clearance, and inflammatory responses in rats and 
mice with pneumococcal meningitis. C1-inh treatment was associated with reduced
clinical illness, a less-pronounced inflammatory infiltrate around the meninges, 
and lower brain levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. C1-inh
treatment increased bacterial clearance, possibly through an up-regulation of
CR3. Hence, C1-inh may be a useful agent in the treatment of pneumococcal
meningitis.
