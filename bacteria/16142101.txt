INTRODUCTION: Mucormycosis is an exceptional opportunist fungal infection,
despite the ubiquitous nature of its pathogenic agents. It is sometimes revealed 
by primary cutaneous involvement and its prognosis is bad in the case of visceral
dissemination. Our observation illustrates the need for early diagnosis and
treatment of this infection.
OBSERVATION: An immunodepressed, 45 year-old woman, had developed necrotic
hypodermitis lesions on the lower limbs. The skin biopsy led to the diagnosis of 
mucormycosis. Despite treatment with liposomal amphotericin, the fungal infection
worsened, spread to the organs (lungs and brain) and the patient died.
DISCUSSION: This case report underlines the potential severity of mucormycosis,
which is presently emerging in the onco-hematological field. The infection is
sometimes revealed by inaugural ulcerated and/or necrotic cutaneous lesions. Its 
diagnosis must be evoked early so that salvage medical-surgical treatment can be 
initiated.
