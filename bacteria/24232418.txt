Thioploca had been encountered in several locations in Central Europe. Five of
these were revisited to find out ifT. schmidlei andT. ingrica were still present 
in these locations. Of the three locations in Lake Constance with abundant
populations, one (Staad) contained a sparse population of small specimens ofT.
ingrica only; from the others (Ermatingen and Mainau) neither species was
recovered. In Lower Saxony two spots reportedly containedT. ingrica. The first of
these (BÃ¼ckeburg) has been destroyed by human stream improvement. The description
of the other (Bad Nenndorf) was insufficient for relocation. During the search a 
new location containingT. ingrica was discovered, Crater Spring, across highway
B65 from Bad Nenndorf.
