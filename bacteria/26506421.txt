The failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy in breast cancers has been closely
associated with the presence of drug resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus,
screening for small molecules that selectively inhibit growth of CSCs may offer
great promise for cancer control, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. 
In this report, we provide the first demonstration that cardamonin, a small
molecule, selectively inhibits breast CSCs that have been enriched by
chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, cardamonin also sufficiently prevents the
enrichment of CSCs when simultaneously used with chemotherapeutic drugs.
Specifically, cardamonin effectively abolishes chemotherapeutic drug-induced
up-regulation of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 and activation of NF-κB/IKBα and Stat3.
Furthermore, in a xenograft mouse model, co-administration of cardamonin and the 
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin significantly retards tumor growth and
simultaneously decreases CSC pools in vivo. Since cardamonin has been found in
some herbs, this work suggests a potential new approach for the effective
treatment of breast CSCs by administration of cardamonin either concurrent with
or after chemotherapeutic drugs.
