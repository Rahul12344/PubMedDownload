BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence supports the notion of "one airway, one disease."
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) poses adverse
impacts on Chinese adults with bronchiectasis.
METHODS: We enrolled 148 consecutive adults with clinically stable
bronchiectasis. CRS diagnosed based on the 2012 EP3OS criteria. We systematically
evaluated the bronchiectasis etiology, radiology, lung function, sputum
bacteriology, airway inflammatory biomarkers, Bronchiectasis Severity Index,
cough sensitivity and healthcare resource utilization. All patients were
prospectively followed-up for 1 year to examine the frequency of bronchiectasis
exacerbations (BEs).
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (31.8%) were diagnosed as having CRS.
Bronchiectasis etiologies did not vary statistically between CRS and no-CRS
group. There was a trend towards non-statistically higher Bronchiectasis Severity
Index [6.4±3.4 vs. 5.0(6.0), P = 0.19], a higher proportion of patients with BEs 
needing hospitalization before enrollment (48.9% vs. 29.7%, P = 0.13), poorer FVC
[78.2±19.8% vs. 82.2(16.8)%, P = 0.54] and FEV1 [68.2±24.8% vs. 74.8(21.2)%, P = 
0.29], a higher prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated (36.2% vs. 26.7%, P
= 0.27) or colonized in sputum (36.2% vs. 21.8%, P = 0.12) and greater capsaicin 
cough sensitivity [C2: 3.9(123.0) μmol/L vs. 11.7(123.0) μmol/L, P = 0.81; C5:
62.5(996.0) μmol/L vs. 250.0(973.0) μmol/L, P = 0.32]. Patients with CRS had
significantly greater risks of experiencing BEs during follow-up (P = 0.02 for
negative binominal regression test).
CONCLUSION: Chinese adults with bronchiectasis appear to have a lower prevalence 
of CRS than that in western countries. There was a trend towards greater adverse 
impacts on bronchiectasis in patients with CRS. Studies with greater sample sizes
might help to resolve this issue. In future clinical practice, physicians should 
be vigilant to the screening of concomitant CRS in bronchiectasis so as to better
improve patient's healthcare. Our findings may be of clinical significance in
that proper treatment of upper airway symptoms due to CRS will be the prevention 
of infection or re-infection of the tracheobronchial tree, which should be
addressed for the future management of bronchiectasis.
