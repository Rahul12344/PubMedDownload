Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a tumor suppressor with complicated
action mechanisms not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that the
nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) is an unexpected partner of PML: PML
specifically enhanced the transcription activation of NFAT. In PML-null mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, no transcription activity of NFAT could be detected. There
was a selective requirement of PML isoform in NFAT activation: PML-I and PML-VI, 
but not PML-IV, increased NFAT transactivation. PML specifically promoted the
expression of many, but not all, NFAT-targeted genes. We found a specific binding
of PML to NFATc. The interaction of PML with NFATc in vivo was further confirmed 
by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA affinity precipitation assay analysis.
The unexpected coupling of PML with NFAT reveals a novel mechanism underlying the
diverse physiological functions of PML.
