Parallel to the diffusion of conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in children, several
studies have shown a reduction of the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease 
both in the vaccinated and in the unvaccinated. Such an observation is not a
surprise if one considers that a similar phenomenon has taken place also after
the mass introduction of Hib vaccine, at its turn a conjugated polysaccharide
vaccine. Another observation is that also the carriage of vaccinal pneumococci
was reduced in both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, while in some cases the 
carriage of non-vaccinal serotypes, definitely less pathogenic, could be
increased.
