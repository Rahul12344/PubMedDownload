Class II transactivator (CIITA), a coactivator required for class II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) transcription, is expressed in B cells but
extinguished in plasma cells. This report identifies B lymphocyte-induced
maturation protein I (BLIMP-I), a transcriptional repressor that is capable of
triggering plasma cell differentiation, as a developmentally regulated repressor 
of CIITA transcription. BLIMP-I represses the B cell-specific promoter of the
human gene that encodes CIITA (MHC2TA) in a binding site-dependent manner.
Decreased CIITA correlates with increased BLIMP-I during plasma cell
differentiation in cultured cells. Ectopic expression of BLIMP-I represses
endogenous mRNA for CIITA and the CIITA targets, class II MHC, invariant chain
and H2-DM (the murine equivalent of HLA-DM) in primary splenic B cells as well as
18-81 pre-B cells. Thus, the BLIMP-I program of B cell differentiation includes
loss of antigen presentation via extinction of CIITA expression.
