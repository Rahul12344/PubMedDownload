Intersegmental interactions in DNA facilitated by the neutralization of
electrostatic repulsion was studied as a function of salt concentration and DNA
supercoiling. DNA samples with defined superhelical densities were deposited onto
aminopropyl mica at different ionic conditions and imaged in air after drying of 
the samples. Similar to hydrodynamic data, we did not observe a collapse of
supercoiled DNA, as proposed earlier by cryo-EM studies. Instead, the formation
of the contacts between DNA helices within supercoiled loops with no visible
space between the duplexes was observed. The length of such close contacts
increased upon increasing NaCl concentration. DNA supercoiling was a critical
factor for the stabilization of intersegmental contacts. Implications of the
observed effect for understanding DNA compaction in the cell and for regulation
DNA transactions via interaction of distantly separated DNA regions are
discussed.
