Little information is available on the functional activity of leukocytes after
arthroplasty or the expansion of populations with immune suppressive properties
during the acute post-operative period. Synovial fluid and matched pre- and
post-surgical blood samples were collected from total hip and knee arthroplasty
patients (THA and TKA, respectively) to examine the impact of surgery on
peripheral blood leukocyte frequency, bactericidal activity, and inflammatory
mediator expression. For spinal surgeries, inflammatory mediator production by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) pre- and post-surgery was examined. An
expansion of immune suppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(G-MDSCs) was observed following arthroplasty, which correlated with
significantly increased serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. Analysis of synovial
fluid from THA and TKAs revealed reduced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and increased interleukin-6 (IL-6),
monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (CCL2) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand
(Flt-3L) compared to pre- and post-surgical serum. For the spinal surgery cohort,
stimulation of PBMCs isolated post-surgery with bacterial antigens produced
significantly less pro-inflammatory (IL-1α, IL-1β, interleukin-1 receptor
antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-12p40, growth-related oncogene-α/GRO-α (CXCL1) and 6Ckine
(CCL21)) and more anti-inflammatory/tissue repair mediators (IL-10, G-CSF and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) compared to PBMCs
recovered before surgery. The observed bias towards systemic anti-inflammatory
changes without concomitant increases in pro-inflammatory responses may influence
susceptibility to infection following orthopaedic surgery in the context of
underlying co-morbidities or risk factors.
