BACKGROUND: The airway surface liquid (ASL) of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients
contains a lower concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) with respect to
healthy people. It is not known whether this defect may favor lung colonization
by opportunistic pathogens.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have analyzed the effects of extracellular GSH on the
ability of Burkholderia cenocepacia to penetrate and multiply in epithelial
respiratory cells. Extracellular GSH proved to be able to drastically reduce the 
pathogen ability to adhere and invade airway epithelial cells. This effect is
correlated to a GSH-dependent increase in the number of free thiols on the
surface of epithelial cells, suggestive of a change in the oxidoreductive status 
of membrane proteins involved in B. cenocepacia recognition. Moreover, treatments
with GSH led to a consistent reduction of the expression of IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β
in response to B. cenocepacia infection.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Extracellular GSH modulates the interaction between
B. cenocepacia and epithelial respiratory cells and inhibits the bacterial
invasion into these cells. This suggests that therapies aimed at restoring normal
levels of GSH in the ASL might be beneficial to control CF lung infections.
