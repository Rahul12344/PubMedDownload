Listeria abortions were established in foetuses of cattle in 1.2% of the cases
investigated in the Erfurt region and 1.8% in the Cottbus region from 1984 to
1989. The isolated strains have been found biochemically to be L. monocytogenes. 
The serological discrimination revealed a majority of serovar O I, II. Typing by 
phages of a part of isolated strains showed a clear predominance of code number
000 124 by the 1/2 a isolate (corresponds to O I, II). This type of phages seems 
to have a epizootiological importance. Listeria abortions were found in (a lot of
63) flocks in the Erfurt region. Nevertheless there were almost no accumulations 
of listeria abortions and listeria encephalitis at the same time in the analysed 
flocks.
