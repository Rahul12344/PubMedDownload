Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are an innate population of T cells
identified by the expression of an invariant T-cell receptor and reactivity to
lipid-based antigens complexed with CD1d. They account for a small percentage of 
lymphocytes, but are extremely potent and play central roles in immunity to
infection, in some cancers, and in autoimmunity. The list of relevant stimulatory
lipids and glycolipid antigens now includes a range of endogenous self-antigens
including the myelin-derived acetylated galactosylceramides. Recent progress in
studies to identify the nature of lipid recognition for iNKT cells in autoimmune 
diseases like multiple sclerosis is likely to foster the development of
therapeutic strategies aimed at harnessing iNKT cell activity.
