DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane) is one of the pesticides that
are hazardous for the environment and human health. Effective
environmental-friendly treatment using co-cultures of fungi and bacteria is
needed. In this study, the bacteria Bacillus subtilis at various volumes of 1, 3,
5, 7, and 10 mL (1 mL ≈ 6.7 × 108 CFU) were mixed into 10 mL of the brown-rot
fungus Fomitopsis pinicola culture for degrading DDT during a 7-days incubation
period. DDT was degraded by approximately 42% by F. pinicola during the 7-days
incubation period. The addition of 10 mL of B. subtilis into F. pinicola culture 
showed the highest DDT degradation of approximately 86% during the 7-days
incubation period. DDD (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane), DDE
(1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene), and DDMU
(1-chloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene) were detected as metabolic products
from DDT degradation by co-cultures of F. pinicola and B. subtilis.
Transformation pathway was proposed in which DDT was transformed into three
pathways as follows: (1) dechlorination to DDD, (2) dehydrochlorination to DDE,
and (3) formation of DDMU.
