A series of phosphinate transition-state analogues of the L-alanine adding enzyme
(MurC) of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis was prepared and tested as
inhibitors of the Escherichia coli enzyme. Compound 4 was identified as a potent 
inhibitor of MurC from Escherichia coli with an IC(50) of 49nM.
