The virulence regulator PqsR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered as an
attractive target for attenuating the bacterial pathogenicity without eliciting
resistance. However, despite efforts and desires, no promising PqsR antagonist
has been discovered thus far. Now, a surprising functionality change of a highly 
affine PqsR antagonist in P. aeruginosa is revealed, which is mediated by a
bacterial signal molecule synthase and responsible for low cellular potency.
Blockade of the susceptible position led to the discovery of the first
antivirulence compound that is potent in vivo and targets PqsR, thus providing a 
proof of concept for this novel antivirulence therapy.
