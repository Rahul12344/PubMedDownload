8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (OdG) is a prominent DNA lesion that can direct the
incorporation of dCTP or dATP during replication. As the latter reaction can lead
to mutation, the ratio of dCTP/dATP incorporation can significantly affect the
mutagenic potential of OdG. Previous work with the A-family polymerase BF and
seven analogues of OdG identified a major groove amino acid, Ile716, which likely
influences the dCTP/dATP incorporation ratio opposite OdG. To further probe the
importance of this amino acid, dCTP and dATP incorporations opposite the same
seven analogues were tested with two BF mutants, I716M and I716A. Results from
these studies support the presence of clashing interactions between Ile716 and
the C8-oxygen and C2-amine during dCTP and dATP incorporations, respectively.
Crystallographic analysis suggests that residue 716 alters the conformation of
the template base prior to insertion into the active site, thereby affecting
enzymatic efficiency. These results are also consistent with previous work with
A-family polymerases, which indicate they have tight, rigid active sites that are
sensitive to template perturbations.
