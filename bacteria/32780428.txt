Mining the genome of the food-spoiling bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pv.
cocovenenans revealed five nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters, 
including an orphan gene locus (bol). Gene inactivation and metabolic profiling
linked the bol gene cluster to novel bolaamphiphilic lipopeptides with
antimycobacterial activity. A combination of chemical analysis and bioinformatics
elucidated the structures of bolagladin A and B, lipocyclopeptides featuring an
unusual dehydro-β-alanine enamide linker fused to an unprecedented tricarboxylic 
fatty acid tail. Through a series of targeted gene deletions, we proved the
involvement of a designated citrate synthase (CS), priming ketosynthases III
(KS III), a type II NRPS, including a novel desaturase for enamide formation, and
a multimodular NRPS in generating the cyclopeptide. Network analyses revealed the
evolutionary origin of the CS and identified cryptic CS/NRPS gene loci in various
bacterial genomes.
