A Streptomyces strain isolated from a hyper-arid Atacama Desert soil was
characterised using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The strain, designated
C2(T), had chemical and morphological properties typical of the genus
Streptomyces. The isolate formed a branch in the Streptomyces 16S rRNA gene tree 
together with the type strain of Streptomyces chromofuscus and was also loosely
related to Streptomyces fragilis NRRL 2424(T). DNA:DNA relatedness values between
the isolate and its two phylogenetic neighbours showed that it formed a distinct 
genomic species. The strain was readily distinguished from these organisms using 
a combination of morphological and phenotypic data. Based on the genotypic and
phenotypic results, isolate C2(T) represents a novel species in the genus
Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces bullii sp. nov. is proposed. The
type strain is C2(T) (=CGMCC 4.7019(T) = KACC 15426(T)).
