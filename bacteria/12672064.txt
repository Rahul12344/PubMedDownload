Natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill certain tumor cells, virally
infected cells and MHC class I-disparate normal hematopoietic cells. NK cell
cytotoxicity is regulated by a multitude of receptors with either activating or
inhibitory signaling function. We here report the molecular cloning of bovine
CD94 [killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR)-D1] and NKp46 orthologues, four
members of a bovine CD158 [killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)]
family, and a novel KLR. This novel receptor was termed KLRJ1 and is most similar
to Ly-49 (KLRA). The KLRD1 and KLRJ1 loci were mapped to a bovine NK gene complex
on chromosome 5 by radiation hybrid mapping, whereas KIR2DL1 and NKP46 were
localized to chromosome 18. Two of the bovine KIR(KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1) contain
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM), suggesting an inhibitory 
function. Bovine KIR2DS1 and KIR3DS1 lack ITIM but have an arginine-containing
motif in their transmembrane domain, similar to primate KIR2DL4. Thus, KIR
multigene families with divergent signaling motifs do not only exist in primates.
Based on sequence comparison, it appears that the primate and bovine KIR
multigene families may have evolved independently.
