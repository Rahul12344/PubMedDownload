[Infections in agranulocytosis and their treatment].

[Article in French]

Dao Ch.

A quantitative deficiency in polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes, due to aplastic
anemia, exposes to infection. The risk is all the greater when the neutropenia is
more marked and more lasting. The infections have a different distribution from
that commonly observed in normal subjects. There is little inflammatory reaction,
no pus formation and bacterial multiplication invades the parenchyma and may
create necrosis due to arteriolar obstruction. The prognosis is very bad. For
example, pulmonary infections in acute leukemia of adults, have a mortality
greater than 75%. Antibiotic treatment and leukocyte transfusions give
disappointing results. The prevention of infections has permitted spectacular
progress. Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis is not linked to the infection
itself, but to the sub-jacent disease responsible for the agranulocytosis. The
infections become cured in transient toxic aplasia and in leukemia where
chemotherapy permits one to obtain a remission. The infections remain fatal
whatever the treatment used if the medullary aplasia is not curable.
