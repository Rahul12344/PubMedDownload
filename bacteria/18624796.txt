Listeria monocytogenes surface proteins internalin (Inl)A and InlB interact with 
the junctional protein E-cadherin and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor
Met, respectively, on the surface of epithelial cells to mediate bacterial entry.
Here we show that InlA triggers two successive E-cadherin post-translational
modifications, i.e. the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin
followed by its ubiquitination by the ubiquitin-ligase Hakai. E-cadherin
ubiquitination induces the recruitment of clathrin that is required for optimal
bacterial internalization. We also show that the initial clustering of E-cadherin
at the bacterial entry site requires caveolin, a protein normally involved in
clathrin-independent endocytosis. Strikingly clathrin and caveolin are also
recruited at the site of entry of E-cadherin-coated sepharose beads and
functional experiments demonstrate that these two proteins are required for bead 
entry. Together these results not only document how the endocytosis machinery is 
recruited and involved in the internalization of a zippering bacterium, but also 
strongly suggest a functional link between E-cadherin endocytosis and the
formation of adherens junctions in epithelial cells.
