The cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the location of
numerous, chemically specific transporters and recognition elements.
Investigation of this membrane in vivo by atomic force microscopy (AFM) requires 
removal of the cell wall and stable immobilization of the spheroplast. AFM images
demonstrate that spheroplasts can be secured with warm gelatin applied to the
mica substrate just before the addition of a spheroplast suspension. The
resulting preparation can be repeatedly imaged by AFM over the course of several 
hours. Confocal fluorescence imaging confirms the association of the spheroplasts
with the gelatin layer. Gelatin molecules are known to reorder into a network
after heating. Entrapment within this gelatin network is believed to be
responsible for the immobilization of spheroplasts on mica.
