Gyrodactylus salmonis (Yin and Sproston, 1948) parasitizing fry of Salvelinus
fontinalis (Mitchill).

Cusack R, Cone DK.

Fry of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill), were infected under
controlled conditions with Gyrodactylus salmonis (Yin and Sproston, 1948) and the
course of infection followed for 22 days in four groups of 40 fish and for 60
days in a group of 200 fish. Between 15 and 44% mortality occurred among infected
groups compared with less than 5% in noninfected control groups. Intensely
infected moribund fish were cachexic, lethargic, and often darkened in color.
Histologic studies revealed that intensely infected fish had a thinner epidermis 
with fewer goblet cells than control fish. Internally the only obvious lesions
involved the kidney where there was extensive tubular degeneration and necrosis. 
It is hypothesized that attachment and grazing activity by G. salmonis can lead
directly to death of fry through disruption of the osmotic permeability of the
epidermis. There was no evidence of secondary invasion by bacteria or fungi.
