Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2)/leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1 (LIR1) is a receptor,
specific for MHC class I molecules, that inhibits lymphoid and myeloid cells.
Here, we analyzed the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ILT2 modulates T
cell activation in primary CTLs and transfected T cell lines. We found that
cross-linking with the TCR and the activity of Src tyrosine kinase p56(lck) were 
required for phosphorylation of ILT2 and subsequent recruitment of Src homology
protein 1. In contrast, ILT2 triggering resulted in reduced phosphorylation of
TCRzeta and linker for activation of T cells, which led to reduced TCRzeta-ZAP70 
complex formation, as well as extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2
activation. Furthermore, ILT2 inhibited both superantigen and anti-TCR Ab-induced
rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. The inhibitory effect mediated by ILT2
is probably concentrated at the APC-T cell interface because both TCR and ILT2
were strongly polarized toward the APC upon engagement by their specific ligands.
Thus, ILT2 inhibits both signaling and cellular events involved in the activation
of T cells.
