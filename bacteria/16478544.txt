BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative
agent of Johne's disease (JD) persistently infects and survives within the host
macrophages. While it is established that substantial genotypic variation exists 
among MAP, evidence for the correlates that associate specific MAP genotypes with
clinical or sub-clinical disease phenotypes is presently unknown. Thus we studied
strain differences in intracellular MAP survival and host responses in a bovine
monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) system.
RESULTS: Intracellular survival studies showed that a bovine MAP isolate (B1018) 
and a human MAP isolate (Hu6) persisted in relatively higher numbers when
compared with a sheep MAP isolate (S7565) at 24-hr, 48-hr and 96-hr post
infection (PI). MDMs stimulated with B1018 up-regulated IL-10 at the transcript
level and down-regulated TNFalpha at the protein and transcript levels compared
with stimulations by the S7565 and Hu6. MDMs infected with Hu6 showed a down
regulatory pattern of IL-10 and TNFalpha compared to stimulations by S7565. Cells
stimulated with B1018 and Hu6 had low levels of matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP3)
and high levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 (TIMP1) at 96-hr PI
relative to MDMs stimulated by S7565.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, results suggest that the bovine (B1018) and the human
(Hu6) MAP isolates lead to anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive pathways in the
macrophage environment whereas the sheep (S7565) MAP isolate induces a
pro-inflammatory pathway. Thus the infecting strain genotype may play a role in
polarizing the host immune responses and dictate the clinicopathological outcomes
in this economically important disease.
