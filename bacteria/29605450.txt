INTRODUCTION: The limitation of therapeutic effort (LTE) depends on medical,
ethical and individual factors. We describe the characteristics of patients with 
bacteremia in which it was decided to limit the therapeutic effort.
METHOD: Prospective study of bacteremia in a community hospital in 2011. We
collected information regarding patient variable (age, sex, Barthel index,
comorbidities, Charlson Index and exogenous factors) as well as regarding the
infectious episode (etiology, focus, place of adquisition, clinical expressivity,
LTE and hospital mortality). The group in which LTE was performed was compared to
the one that was not.
RESULTS: We collected 233 episodes of bacteremia in 227 patients. We performed
LTE in 19 patients (8.2%). Patients with LTE were older (80.7 vs. 72.6 years,
p=.014), had more comorbidity (Charlson index 4.6 vs. 2.1, p<.001 and most
frequently were severe dependents (57.9% vs. 18.8%, p<.001). We found no
association with sex, place of adquisition or clinical expressivity. The
commonest clinical focus in patients with LTE was the urinary (42.1%) and there
was a predominance of gram positive bacteria (63.2%). The empirical treatment was
started early in 73.7% of cases. All patients except one died.
CONCLUSION: LTE is considered in an important number of patients with bacteremia.
They usually are older, with more comorbidity and functional dependence, bad
functional basal status and important comorbidity. Knowing their differential
characteristics allow us to understand this decision.
