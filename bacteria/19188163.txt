A novel human Her-2/neu chimeric molecule expressed by Listeria monocytogenes can
elicit potent HLA-A2 restricted CD8-positive T cell responses and impact the
growth and spread of Her-2/neu-positive breast tumors.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to efficiently design a novel vaccine for
human Her-2/neu-positive (hHer-2/neu) breast cancer using the live, attenuated
bacterial vector Listeria monocytogenes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three recombinant L. monocytogenes-based vaccines were
generated that could express and secrete extracellular and intracellular
fragments of the hHer-2/neu protein. In addition, we generated a fourth construct
fusing selected portions of each individual fragment that contained most of the
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) epitopes as a combination vaccine (L.
monocytogenes-hHer-2/neu chimera).
RESULTS: Each individual vaccine was able to either fully regress or slow tumor
growth in a mouse model for Her-2/neu-positive tumors. All three vaccines could
elicit immune responses directed toward human leukocyte antigen-A2 epitopes of
hHer-2/neu. The L. monocytogenes-hHer-2/neu chimera was able to mimic responses
generated by the three separate vaccines and prevent spontaneous outgrowth of
tumors in an autochthonous model for Her-2/neu-positive breast cancer, induce
tumor regression in transplantable models, and prevent seeding of experimental
lung metastases in a murine model for metastatic breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: This novel L. monocytogenes-hHer-2/neu chimera vaccine proves to be
just as effective as the individual vaccines but combines the strength of all
three in a single vaccination. These encouraging results support future clinical 
trials using this chimera vaccine and may be applicable to other cancer types
expressing the Her-2/neu molecule such as colorectal and pancreatic cancer.
