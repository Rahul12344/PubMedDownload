The ars operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 produces resistance to arsenicals
in cells of Escherichia coli. The operon encodes an oxyanion pump which is
composed of a membrane subunit, the 45.5-kDa ArsB protein, and a catalytic
subunit, the 63-kDa ArsA protein. Purified ArsA protein is an
arsenite(antimonite)-stimulated ATPase. From its amino acid sequence, as deduced 
from the nucleotide sequence, the ArsA protein has four tryptophanyl residues
which could serve as intrinsic fluorescent probes for the study of
substrate-induced conformational changes. Both static and dynamic measurements of
tryptophan fluorescence were performed with the ArsA protein. Results from static
anisotropy measurements indicated differences in molecular motion with addition
of ATP, SbO2-, or Mg2+. These results were supported by time decay measurements
of fluorescence anisotropy. The results of time decay measurements indicated a
shorter correlation time, reflecting localized motion in the vicinity of the
probe, and a longer correlation time, which could have arisen from rotation of
the major portion of the molecule. The longer correlation time changed with
addition of the various effectors, especially MgCl2, suggesting that binding of
Mg2+ decreases probe mobility.
