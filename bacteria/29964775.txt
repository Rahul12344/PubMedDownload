Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) is a scientific tool used to evaluate health 
of aquatic ecosystems. IBI associates anthropogenic influences with biological
activity in the water body, and is formulated using data developed from
biosurveys. Compared with other biotic assemblage indicators of water quality,
little attention has been paid to the application of microbial community in
ecosystem health assessment for groundwater bodies so far. An approach based on
microbiome index of biotic integrity was developed to assess groundwater
ecosystem health in this study. The method based on Illumina high-throughput DNA 
sequencing was applied to achieve the information of microbial community. The key
environmental factors were selected based on CCA analysis and the optimized
values were calculated for defining the taxonomic genera sensitive and resistant 
to these factors. The resulting candidate biotic factors were used to construct
microbiome index of biotic integrity (M-IBI) evaluating system. The results
showed among the studied sample sites from groundwater of Baogang rare earth
tailings, 33.3% of samples were at "Great" level, 16.7% at "Good" level, most of 
samples (41.7%) at "moderate" level and 8.3% at "Bad" level. The ecosystem
healthy status of the sample sites near the tailings was affected by human
disturbances, while the samples far away the tailings were at healthy level. The 
results of the groundwater ecosystem healthy assessment based on M-IBI system had
a good match with the groundwater quality standard based on chemical properties. 
It indicated that M-IBI could be a potential index to evaluate the health of
groundwater ecosystem.
