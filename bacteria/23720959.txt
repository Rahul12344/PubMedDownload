The effect of univalent cations on activity of key enzymes of C2-metabolism has
been investigated in the producer of biosurfactants, Acinetibacter calcoaceticus 
IMV B-7241 grown on ethanol. It was established that potassium cations are
inhibitors of pyroquinolinequinone-dependent alcohol- and acetaldehyde
dehydrogenases, the enzymes of biosynthesis of surface-active aminolipids
(NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase) and glycolipids (phosphoenopyruvate
(PhEP)-carboxikinase), while ammonium cations are activators of these enzymes and
PhEP-carboxylase. A decrease of potassium cations concentration in the
cultivation medium to 1 mM and increase of the content of amine nitrogen to 10 mM
as a result of potassium nitrate substitution by equimolar, as to nitrogen, urea 
concentration were accompanied by the increase of activity of enzymes of ethanol 
metabolism and SAS biosynthesis, as well as by the 2-fold increase of conditional
concentration of the biosurfactants.
