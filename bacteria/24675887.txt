During mitosis the nuclear envelope breaks down, leading to potential
interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear components. PML bodies are nuclear
structures with tumor suppressor and antiviral functions. Early endosomes, on the
other hand, are cytoplasmic vesicles involved in transport and growth factor
signaling. Here we demonstrate that PML bodies form stable interactions with
early endosomes immediately following entry into mitosis. The 2 compartments
remain stably associated throughout mitosis and dissociate in the cytoplasm of
newly divided daughter cells. We also show that a minor subset of PML bodies
becomes anchored to the mitotic spindle poles during cell division. The study
demonstrates a stable mitosis-specific interaction between a cytoplasmic and a
nuclear compartment.
