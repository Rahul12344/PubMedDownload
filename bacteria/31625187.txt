BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is no standard methodology for post-thaw sample 
preparation for viability analysis of umbilical cord blood units (CBU). A common 
challenge faced by CB bank is for their product to meet the post-thaw cell
viability threshold for CD45+ cells set at 40% by NetCord-FACT. The objective of 
this work was to improve the post-thaw staining method to maximize CD45+ cell
viability so that clinically valuable samples meet the NetCord-FACT threshold
criteria for CD45+ and CD34+ cell viabilities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of CBU buffy coats and CBU segments were thawed
and taken for staining. Various parameters were evaluated on CD45+ and CD34+ cell
viability as measured by 7-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining.
RESULTS: The results revealed that initiating the staining at 20 min post-thaw
instead of 30, shortening the red cell lysis treatment, or performing lysis on
ice and removing this step all together, all improved the viability of CD45+
cells. Using CBU segments, it was shown that the most effective approach in
increasing the viability of CD45+ cells was the complete omission of red cell
lysis step. However, removal of the lysis step can create technical artefacts
during flow cytometry acquisition that results in an underestimation of the
viability of CD34+ cells. This can be avoided and CD34+ cell viability restored
with additional thresholding on CD45 signal.
CONCLUSION: CB CD45+ cells are sensitive to red cell lysis treatment post-thaw;
omission of this step provides the best viability and ultimately better reflects 
the quality of cells used for transplantation.
