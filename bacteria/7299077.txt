Effect of DDT, fauna and flooding on microsomal growth in soil.

Tu CM.

Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of DDT, fauna and
flooding on microbial growth in a sandy loam. Results indicated that soil
microorganisms can tolerate the presence of DDT. Earthworms singly or in
combination with springtails affected the average population of fungi in the
DDT-untreated samples and of aerobic bacteria in the DDT-treated soils. Soil
animals did not appear to have any effect on the populations of anaerobic
bacteria. However, waterlogging brought about a decrease in aerobic bacteria and 
fungal populations, and an increase in anaerobic bacteria in both soils.
