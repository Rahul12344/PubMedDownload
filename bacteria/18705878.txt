Phytophthora infestans remains a problem to production agriculture. Historically 
there have been many controversies concerning its biology and pathogenicity, some
of which remain today. Advances in molecular biology and genomics promise to
reveal fascinating insight into its pathogenicity and biology. However, the
plasticity of its genome as revealed in population diversity and in the abundance
of putative effectors means that this oomycete remains a formidable foe.
