PURPOSE: The intestinal microbiota has emerged as a virtual organ with essential 
functions in human physiology. Antibiotic-induced disruption of the microbiota in
critically ill patients may have a negative influence on key energy resources and
immunity. We set out to characterize the fecal microbiota composition in
critically ill patients both with and without sepsis and to explore the use of
microbiota-derived markers for clinical outcome measurements in this setting.
METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study we analyzed the fecal
microbiota of 34 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Fifteen healthy
subjects served as controls. The fecal microbiota was phylogenetically
characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and associations with clinical outcome
parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: A marked shift in fecal bacterial composition was seen in all septic and
non-septic critically ill patients compared with controls, with extreme
interindividual differences. In 13 of the 34 patients, a single bacterial genus
made up >50% of the gut microbiota; in 4 patients this was even >75%. A
significant decrease in bacterial diversity was observed in half of the patients.
No associations were found between microbiota diversity, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes
ratio, or Gram-positive/Gram-negative ratio and outcome measurements such as
complications and survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed highly heterogeneous patterns of intestinal microbiota
in both septic and non-septic critically ill patients. Nevertheless, some general
patterns were observed, including disappearance of bacterial genera with
important functions in host metabolism. More detailed knowledge of the short- and
long-term health consequences of these major shifts in intestinal bacterial
communities is needed.
