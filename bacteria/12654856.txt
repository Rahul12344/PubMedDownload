To determine the role of endogenous interleukin-10 (IL-10) in local host defense 
during pneumococcal meningitis, the inflammatory responses of
IL-10-gene-deficient and wild-type mice after the induction of meningitis were
compared. The absence of IL-10 was associated with higher cytokine and chemokine 
concentrations and a more pronounced infiltrate, but antibacterial defense or
survival was not influenced.
