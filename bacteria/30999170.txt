Residual dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the environment and a
continuously increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration are two
issues that have received a lot of attention. This study was conducted using a
pot experiment to investigate the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and DDT on 
the uptake of DDT, the physiological responses and the resulting health risks in 
three vegetables. These vegetables included Brassica juncea var. foliosa Bailey
(B. Bailey), Brassica campestris L. var. communis Tsen et Lee Suzhou Qing
(B. Lee) and Brassica campestris L. ssp. pekinensis (Lour.) Olsson Chun Dawang
(B. Olsson). Two levels of CO2 and four DDT treatment levels were set up. Results
showed 5 mg kg-1 DDT significantly reduced the shoot biomass of B. Bailey when
compared to 0 mg kg-1 DDT treatment under ambient CO2 condition. Elevated CO2
concentration stimulated the growth of B. Bailey and B. Lee, increased the DDT
uptake in the shoots of both vegetables and the values of some photosynthesis
indices, and triggered the activity of peroxidase and catalase in the shoots when
compared to the related ambient CO2 treatment. Elevated CO2 concentration
increased the values of hazard indexes for non-carcinogenic and cancer risks of
all vegetables when compared to the individual ambient CO2 treatment (each of
vegetable has an ambient CO2 treatment), especially for B. Bailey (increase
amplitude of 123.81%-127.78% at 5 mg kg-1 DDT). Long-term ingestion with these
DDT-polluted vegetables might result in an elevated carcinogenic risk and
elevated atmospheric CO2 may enhance the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks.
