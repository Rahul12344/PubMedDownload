Candida albicans (CA) is a frequent opportunistic pathogen in cancer patients.
Usually, human surfaces are protected, apart from physical barriers, by the
production of human beta-defensins (hBD). hBD-2 shows a potent antimicrobial
activity against CA. We therefore investigated whether CA induces hBD-2
expression in primary oral cells and if immunosuppressive betamethasone alters
hBD-2 expression. Additionally, we studied, whether a lack of hBD-2 expression
could explain opportunistic infection of tonsillar cancer. Primary oral
epithelial cells and fibroblasts were stimulated with Candida albicans in a time-
and dose-dependent manner with or without betamethasone preincubation. Total RNA 
from oral cells and specimens was isolated and hBD-2 expression was analyzed by
semiquantitative RT-PCR. Our data demonstrate that opportunistic CA induced hBD-2
expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting hBD-2 to be a fast
antifungal, epithelia-derived immune response. Treatment with glucocorticoid
could lead to diminished innate immunity based on suppression of inducible AP.
Malignant transformation induces alteration of hBD-2 expression and leads to a
reduced hBD-2 expression and subsequentially to Candida colonization on oral
SCCs.
