Nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Addition of retinoic acid (RA) to chemotherapy was proposed to
improve survival of some of these patients. Here, we found that RA or arsenic
trioxide synergistically induce proteasomal degradation of mutant NPM1 in AML
cell lines or primary samples, leading to differentiation and apoptosis. NPM1
mutation not only delocalizes NPM1 from the nucleolus, but it also disorganizes
promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Combined RA/arsenic treatment
significantly reduced bone marrow blasts in 3 patients and restored the
subnuclear localization of both NPM1 and PML. These findings could explain the
proposed benefit of adding RA to chemotherapy in NPM1 mutant AMLs, and warrant a 
broader clinical evaluation of regimen comprising a RA/arsenic combination.
