Natural CO2 venting systems can mimic conditions that resemble intermediate to
high pCO2 levels as predicted for our future oceans. They represent ideal sites
to investigate potential long-term effects of ocean acidification on marine life.
To test whether microbes are affected by prolonged exposure to pCO2 levels, we
examined the composition and diversity of microbial communities in oxic sandy
sediments along a natural CO2 gradient. Increasing pCO2 was accompanied by higher
bacterial richness and by a strong increase in rare members in both bacterial and
archaeal communities. Microbial communities from sites with CO2 concentrations
close to today's conditions had different structures than those of sites with
elevated CO2 levels. We also observed increasing sequence abundance of several
organic matter degrading types of Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, which
paralleled concurrent shifts in benthic cover and enhanced primary productivity. 
With increasing pCO2 , sequences related to bacterial nitrifying organisms such
as Nitrosococcus and Nitrospirales decreased, and sequences affiliated to the
archaeal ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota Nitrosopumilus maritimus increased. Our
study suggests that microbial community structure and diversity, and likely key
ecosystem functions, may be altered in coastal sediments by long-term CO2
exposure to levels predicted for the end of the century.
