A microbial electrosynthesis cell comprising two biological cathode chambers
sharing the same anode compartment is used to promote the production of C2-C4
carboxylic acids and alcohols from carbon dioxide. Each cathode chamber provides 
ideal pH conditions to favor acetogenesis/carbon chain elongation (pH = 6.9), and
solventogenesis (pH = 4.9), respectively, without the requirement of external
acid/base dosing.
