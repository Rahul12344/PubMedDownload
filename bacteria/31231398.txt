In 2014, specific recommendations for complement nomenclature were presented by
the complement field. There remained some unresolved designations and new areas
of ambiguity, and here we propose solutions to resolve these remaining issues. To
enable rapid understanding of the intricate complement system and facilitate
therapeutic development and application, a uniform nomenclature for cleavage
fragments, pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) and enzymes of the lectin pathway
and regulatory proteins of the complement system are proposed, and a
standardization of language to designate different activation states of
complement components is recommended.
