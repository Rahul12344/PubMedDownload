Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common gram-negative respiratory
pathogen. To determine the role of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 18
(IL-18) during NTHi pneumonia, normal wild-type (WT) and IL-18 knockout (KO) mice
were intranasally infected with NTHi. IL-18 KO mice displayed a delayed clearance
of NTHi from the respiratory tract, resulting in >20-fold higher bacterial loads 
in their lungs at 24 h after infection, preceded by a strongly attenuated
pulmonary innate immune response as determined by cytokine and chemokine
induction and histopathology. These data identify IL-18 as part of an adequate
innate immune response during NTHi pneumonia.
