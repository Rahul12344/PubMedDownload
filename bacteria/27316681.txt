Previous studies demonstrated that IL-12-driven antitumor activity is
short-circuited by a rapid switch in dendritic cell (DC) function from
immunogenic to tolerogenic activity. This process was dependent on IFN-γ and the 
tolerogenic phenotype was conferred by IDO. Extended monitoring of IDO(+) DC in
the tumor-draining lymph nodes of IL-12 plus GM-CSF-treated tumor-bearing mice
revealed that whereas IFN-γ induction was transient, IDO expression in DC was
maintained long-term. An in vitro system modeling the IFN-γ-mediated change in DC
function was developed to dissect the molecular basis of persistent IDO
expression in post-IL-12 DC. Stimulation of DC with IFN-γ and CD40L resulted in
rapid induction of IDO1 and IDO2 transcription and recapitulated the in vivo
switch from immunogenic to tolerogenic activity. Long-term maintenance of IDO
expression was found to be independent of exogenous and autocrine IFN-γ, or the
secondary cytokines TGF-β, TNF-α, and IL-6. In contrast, both IDO enzymatic
activity and IFN-γ-induced AhR expression were required for continued IDO
transcription in vitro and in vivo. Addition of the tryptophan catabolite
kynurenine to DC cultures in which IDO activity was blocked restored long-term
IDO expression in wild-type DC but not in AhR-deficient DC, establishing the
central role of the kynurenine-AhR pathway in maintaining IDO expression in
tolerogenic DC. These findings shed further light on the cellular and molecular
biology of the post-IL-12 regulatory rebound and provide insight into how
feedback inhibitory mechanisms dominate in the long-term.
