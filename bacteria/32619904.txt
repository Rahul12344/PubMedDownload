The major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) complex functions in innate and
adaptive immunity, mediating surveillance of the subcellular environment. In
humans, MHC-I heavy chains are encoded by three genes: the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. These genes are highly polymorphic, which
results in the expression, typically, of six different HLA class I (HLA-I)
proteins on the cell surface, and the presentation of diverse peptide antigens to
CD8+ T cells for broad surveillance against many pathogenic conditions. Recent
studies of HLA-B allotypes show that the polymorphisms, not surprisingly, also
significantly impact protein folding and assembly pathways. The use of
non-canonical assembly routes and the generation of non-canonical HLA-B
conformers has consequences for immune receptor interactions and disease
therapies.
