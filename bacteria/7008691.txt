Effects of pesticides on the fatty acid and phospholipid composition of
Escherichia coli.

Rosas SB, Secco M, Ghittoni NE.

Cells of Escherichia coli contained an altered phospholipid and fatty acid
composition when grown in the presence of some pesticides. Whereas parathion
increased the concentration of all phospholipid species without changes in their 
polar head groups. DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) decreased the proportion
of neutral serine-derived phosphatides and dieldrin decreased the proportion of
negatively charged phospholipids. The saturated/unsaturated plus cyclopropane
fatty acid ratio was increased in all cases. The changes suggested that cells
adapted their membrane lipids to compensate for the presence of pesticides in the
environment.
