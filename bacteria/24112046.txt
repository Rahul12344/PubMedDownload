The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a validated target for broad spectrum
antibiotics. However, the efficiency of drugs is reduced by resistance. To
discover novel RNAP inhibitors, a pharmacophore based on the alignment of
described inhibitors was used for virtual screening. In an optimization process
of hit compounds, novel derivatives with improved in vitro potency were
discovered. Investigations concerning the molecular mechanism of RNAP inhibition 
reveal that they prevent the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between σ(70) and 
the RNAP core enzyme. Besides of reducing RNA formation, the inhibitors were
shown to interfere with bacterial lipid biosynthesis. The compounds were active
against Gram-positive pathogens and revealed significantly lower resistance
frequencies compared to clinically used rifampicin.
