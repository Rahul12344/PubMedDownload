DDT is reductively dechlorinated to DDD and dehydrochlorinated to DDE; it has
been thought that DDE is not degraded further in the environment. Laboratory
experiments with DDE-containing marine sediments showed that DDE is dechlorinated
to DDMU in both methanogenic and sulfidogenic microcosms and that DDD is
dehydrochlorinated to DDMU three orders of magnitude more slowly. Thus, DDD does 
not appear to be an important precursor of the DDMU found in these sediments.
These results imply that remediation decisions and risk assessments based on the 
recalcitrance of DDE in marine and estuarine sediments should be reevaluated.
