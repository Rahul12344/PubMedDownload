Food ice is used as an ingredient or as a coolant in drinks and in the storage of
food, especially fishery products. Studies show that ice can be polluted both by 
chemical substances and by bacteria and fungi. In particular, the presence of
fungi in these food matrices has acquired an important role in Public Health, as 
it can represent a risk factor for fungal complications in immunocompromised
subjects. In the present study we evaluated the hygiene-sanitary quality of food 
ice from public and collective catering establishments in a large area of
Southern Italy, investigating the mandatory parameters (Escherichia coli,
coliform and Enterococci) and some accessory parameters (Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi) provided for Italian Legislative Decree 31/01. 
Although 54.5% of samples were compliant, the results highlight a vast
contamination of food ice by bacteria and fungi. In particular, 95.8% of samples 
were contaminated by fungi, stressing no difference between compliant and
non-compliant samples. Their presence is generally attributable to the poor
sanitation conditions in the production and/or administration phase and to the
incorrect sanitization and ordinary maintenance procedures. It seems appropriate 
to suggest the need to carry out a specific risk assessment with respect to the
self-control plans.
