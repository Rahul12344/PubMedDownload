DL-2-Haloacid dehalogenase from Methylobacterium sp. CPA1 (DL-DEX Mb) is a unique
enzyme that catalyzes the dehalogenation reaction without the formation of an
ester intermediate. A recombinant form of DL-DEX Mb has been expressed in
Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop
vapour-diffusion method. The crystal belongs to the hexagonal space group P6(3), 
with unit-cell parameters a = b = 186.2, c = 114.4 A. The crystals are likely to 
contain between four and eight monomers in the asymmetric unit, with a V(M) value
of 4.20-2.10 A3 Da(-1). A self-rotation function revealed peaks on the chi = 180 
degrees section. X-ray data have been collected to 1.75 A resolution.
