In this study, we used an HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model to investigate the
effects of pulmonary delivery of a new DNA plasmid encoding eight
HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell epitopes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis formulated 
in chitosan nanoparticles. It was shown that the chitosan-DNA formulation was
able to induce the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) while chitosan solution
alone could not, indicating the DNA was released from the particles and able to
stimulate DCs. Pulmonary administration of the DNA plasmid incorporated in
chitosan nanoparticles was shown to induce increased levels of IFN-gamma
secretion compared to pulmonary delivery of plasmid in solution or the more
frequently used intramuscular immunization route. These results indicate that
pulmonary delivery of DNA vaccines against tuberculosis may provide an
advantageous delivery route compared to intramuscular immunization, and that
increased immunogenicity can be achieved by delivery of this DNA encapsulated in 
chitosan nanoparticles.
