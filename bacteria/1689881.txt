A previously reported acceleration of parathion metabolism in the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract of lindane-pretreated rats could have been due to
either a prolonged residence time of parathion or increased GI nitroreductase
activity or both. Thus to determine the effect on GI nitroreductase and
dechlorinase activity, 20 mg/kg lindane or 535 mg/kg neomycin were administered
daily, by gavage, to weanling F-344 rats. Enzyme activity in the small intestine 
and cecum were assayed after 2 weeks and 5 weeks of treatment. Neomycin treatment
inhibited the activity of both enzymes in the cecum but had no significant effect
on enzyme activity in the small intestine, suggesting the presence of mucosal
nitroreductase and dechlorinase in the small intestine. In contrast, lindane,
which had no effect on enzyme activity in the cecum, significantly increased
nitroreductase activity in the small intestine after treatment for 5 weeks. This 
increased nitroreductase may account for the previously reported
lindane-parathion interaction and could influence the metabolism, toxicity, and
risk assessment of many other environmental nitro-compounds that become toxic,
mutagenic or carcinogenic upon reduction of their nitro-groups.
