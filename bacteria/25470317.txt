The biosynthetic origins of epoxyquinols A (1) and B (2) produced by an
unidentified fungus have attracted considerable interest because these compounds 
could be assembled from a biosynthetic precursor, epoxycyclohexenone aldehyde
(3), via an electrocyclization/intermolecular Diels-Alder dimerization cascade
reaction. Furthermore, very little is known about the biosynthetic origins of
naturally occurring epoxyquinone moieties. We herein describe the incorporation
of (13)C at specific positions within the structure of a shunt product,
epoxycyclohexenone (4), using stable isotope feeding experiments with sodium
[1-(13)C]-acetate and sodium [1,2-(13)C2]-acetate. The results of these
experiments strongly suggest that the epoxyquinone skeleton is assembled by a
polyketide synthase.
