In this study, four modified gp100 peptides were designed by combining amino
acids from the melanoma peptide antigen gp100((209-217)) with preferred primary
and auxiliary HLA-A *0201 anchor residues previously identified from
combinatorial peptide library screening with recombinant HLA-A*0201. These
modified peptides demonstrated stronger binding affinity for the HLA-A*0201
molecule compared to wild-type gp100 peptide. Nine CTL lines generated from
patients immunized with the g209-2 M peptide and one CTL line from a
non-immunized patient were tested for the ability to respond to these modified
gp100 peptides. Stimulation of CTL by two of four modified peptides induced
higher levels of IFN-gamma secretion than the wild-type gp100 peptide,
demonstrating that higher peptide binding affinity for HLA molecules does not
necessarily equate to functional activity of CTL. Two major and one minor CTL
recognition pattern were observed, irrespective of previous peptide immunization,
suggesting that multiple, rationally designed modified tumor peptides for the
same epitope stimulate a broad CTL response by activating multiple CTL capable of
cross-reacting with the natural antigenic peptide.
