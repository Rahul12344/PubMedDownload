As the regulatory environment for compounding pharmacies continues to evolve,
facilities can take immediate steps to strengthen their quality-control
microbiology and environmental monitoring programs. Robust programs that are
timely, comprehensive, and effective will minimize risk and help support positive
patient outcomes. This article provides a roadmap for putting in place a robust
quality-control microbiology program in the face of United States Pharmacopeia
Chapter 797 standards, and highlights several technologies for environmental
monitoring that support a successful program.
