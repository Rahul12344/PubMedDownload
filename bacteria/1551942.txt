Leprosy patients undergoing phase II trials in two hospitals of New Delhi, India,
were HLA typed to see the association of HLA with differential responsiveness to 
Mycobacterium w vaccine. The vaccine comprises an atypical, nonpathogenic
mycobacterium, Mycobacterium w, which has cross-reactive antigens with M. leprae.
Multibacillary patients who are lepromin negative are vaccinated at an interval
of 3 months. Considerable improvement is evident in the patients in terms of a
decline in bacterial indices and histopathological and immunological upgrading.
But all the patients do not respond to the vaccine in the same manner; some are
slow responders, while others are good responders. HLA-A28 and DQw3 (DQw8 + 9)
were found to be associated with slow responsiveness, while DQw1 and DQw7 were
found to be associated with a more rapid responsiveness to the M. w vaccine.
However, these associations were not significant after P correction for the
number of antigens tested for each locus except for HLA-DQw3 (DQw8 and DQw9) and 
DQw7. DQw7, a new defined split of HLA-DQw3, seems to be associated with the
responsiveness to M. w vaccine.
