The gene product of braB encoding the Na+(Li+)-coupled carrier protein for
L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-valine (LIV-II carrier) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
PML strain was identified and overexpressed using a T7 RNA polymerase/promoter
plasmid system. The gene product was pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine as a
protein of an apparent Mr of 34,000 on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel. Cell membranes overproducing the LIV-II carrier were solubilized with
n-dodecyl beta-D-maltopyranoside. The carrier protein was purified from the
detergent extract by two purification steps: (i) immunoaffinity column
chromatography using purified polyclonal antibody directed against synthetic
13-mer peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus region of the carrier and
(ii) subsequent DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The detergent was replaced 
by n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside prior to the first elution and phospholipid was
present during purification. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified
LIV-II carrier exhibited Na+ or Li+ concentration gradient-driven transport of
leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These results show that the LIV-II carrier was
purified to be in a functional form.
