BACKGROUND: Beside their role in hemostasis, platelets serve as sentinel cells in
host defense during infection. In sepsis, platelets have been implicated in both 
beneficial (antibacterial) and detrimental responses (thrombosis and organ
damage). Toll-like receptors and their common adaptor, myeloid differentiation
factor 88 (MyD88), are essential for pathogen recognition and protective
immunity. Platelets express functional Toll-like receptors and MyD88, which
participate in platelet responsiveness to bacterial agonists.
OBJECTIVE: Considering the pivotal involvement of platelets and MyD88 in the host
response to bacteria, we studied the role of platelet MyD88 in gram-negative
sepsis using intravenous and airway infections with the common human sepsis
pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae.
METHODS: Platelet-specific Myd88(-/-) mice were generated by crossing mice with a
conditional Myd88 flox allele with mice expressing Cre recombinase controlled by 
the platelet factor 4 promoter. In a reverse approach, full Myd88(-/-) mice were 
transfused with wild-type platelets.
RESULTS: In both settings, platelet MyD88 did not impact on bacterial growth or
dissemination. In addition, platelet MyD88 did not influence hallmark sepsis
responses such as thrombocytopenia, coagulation or endothelial activation, or
distant organ injury. Platelet MyD88 played no role in lung pathology during
pneumonia-derived sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Despite known literature, platelet MyD88-dependent TLR signaling does
not contribute to the host response during gram-negative sepsis.
