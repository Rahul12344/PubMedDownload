The tyrosine phosphatase YopH is an essential virulence factor produced by
pathogenic Yersinia species. YopH is translocated into host cells via a type III 
secretion system and its dephosphorylating activity causes disruption of focal
complex structures and blockage of the phagocytic process. Among the host cell
targets of YopH are the focal adhesion proteins Crk-associated substrate
(p130Cas) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in epithelial cells, and p130Cas and
Fyn-binding protein (Fyb) in macrophages. Previous studies have shown that the
N-terminal domain of YopH acts as a substrate-binding domain. In this study, the 
mechanism and biological importance of the targeting of YopH to focal complexes
relative to its interaction with p130Cas/Fyb was elucidated. Mutants of YopH that
were defective in p130Cas/Fyb binding but otherwise indistinguishable from wild
type were constructed. Mutants unable to bind p130Cas did not localize to focal
complex structures in infected cells, indicating that the association with
p130Cas is critical for appropriate subcellular localization of YopH. These yopH 
mutants were also clearly attenuated in virulence, showing that binding to
p130Cas and/or Fyb is biologically relevant in Yersinia infections.
