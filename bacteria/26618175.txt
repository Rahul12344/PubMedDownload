Imatinib resistance is an emerging problem in the therapy of chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML). Because imatinib induces apoptosis, which may be coupled with
mitochondria and DNA damage is a prototype apoptosis-inducing factor, we
hypothesized that imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells might
differentially express apoptosis-related mitochondrially encoded genes in
response to genotoxic stress. We investigated the effect of doxorubicin (DOX), a 
DNA-damaging anticancer drug, on apoptosis and the expression of the
mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 3 (MT-ND3) and cytochrome b (MT-CYB) in model
CML cells showing imatinib resistance caused by Y253H mutation in the BCR-ABL1
gene (253) or culturing imatinib-sensitive (S) cells in increasing concentrations
of imatinib (AR). The imatinib-resistant 253 cells displayed higher sensitivity
to apoptosis induced by 1 μM DOX and this was confirmed by an increased activity 
of executioner caspases 3 and 7 in those cells. Native mitochondrial potential
was lower in imatinib-resistant cells than in their sensitive counterparts and
DOX lowered it. MT-CYB mRNA expression in 253 cells was lower than that in S
cells and 0.1 μM DOX kept this relationship. In conclusion, imatinib resistance
may be associated with altered mitochondrial response to genotoxic stress, which 
may be further exploited in CML therapy in patients with imatinib resistance.
