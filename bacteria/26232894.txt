OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess salivary, serum biomarkers, and
subgingival bacteria as putative candidates in the potential association between 
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and periodontal disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were grouped according to the severity 
of OSAS: 13 participants served as controls, 17 patients had mild-to-moderate
OSAS, and 22 severe OSAS. Serum, saliva, and subgingival plaque samples were
collected, and clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Salivary, serum
concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α),
osteoprotegerin, soluble Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand
(sRANKL), and apelin were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Bacterial counts were determined by real-time QPCR on plaque microbial DNA
preparations.
RESULTS: There was a significant change in the composition of microbes in plaque 
particularly in severe OSAS samples (p < 0.01). Statistical analyses indicated
significantly higher salivary IL-6 levels in both OSAS groups compared to
controls (p < 0.05). Salivary apelin levels were significantly higher in the
severe OSAS group compared to the control group. Serum levels of these biomarkers
and salivary osteoprotegerin, sRANKL levels were similar in the study groups. The
incidence and duration of apnea positively correlated with clinical periodontal
parameters (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: OSAS appeared to alter the tested bacteria in plaque, correlate with 
increasing periodontal disease severity, have additive effect on salivary IL-6.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: OSAS is likely to associate with periodontal disease.
