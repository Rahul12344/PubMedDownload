The environmental behaviour and the bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are strongly affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM) in
aquatic environments. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the
bioavailability and character of the intracellular DOM (IDOM) from Microcystis
aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa-IDOM) during 10 days oxic and anoxic incubations by
spectroscopy. Subsequently, the binding affinity of pyrene with the
initial/altered M. aeruginosa-IDOM was estimated by fluorescence quenching
method. The incubation results indicated that changes in dissolved organic carbon
(DOC) concentration and selected spectral descriptors of the M. aeruginosa-IDOM
under oxic condition were different from those of anoxic condition. The microbial
transformation of the M. aeruginosa-IDOM resulted in an enhancement of the
organic carbon-normalized binding coefficient (K DOC) of pyrene in both oxic and 
anoxic treatments. Moreover, only for the oxic condition, Pearson correlation
analysis demonstrated that aromaticity (specific UV absorbance at 254 nm,
SUVA254), humification degree (humification index, HIX) and the percent
distribution of humic-like component 2 (%C2) presented significantly positive
correlations with the pyrene K DOC, while the percent distribution of
protein-like component 1 (%C1) exhibited a negative correlation with the K DOC.
However, no significant correlation was observed between any spectral descriptor 
and the K DOC under anoxic condition. This result suggested that the binding
affinity of pyrene may be primarily influenced by the altered M. aeruginosa-IDOM 
characteristics associated with the biological transformation. Hence, our results
provided potential evidence for resolving the inconsistency in the relationships 
between DOM characteristics and the binding affinities of PAHs.
