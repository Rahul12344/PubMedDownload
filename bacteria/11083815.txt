mice.

Elevated concentrations of interleukin-1 (IL-1) were found in tissue surrounding 
biomaterials infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis. To determine the role of
IL-1 in biomaterial-associated infection (BAI), IL-1 receptor type I-deficient
(IL-1R(-/-)) and wild-type mice received subcutaneous implants of silicon
elastomer (SE) or polyvinylpyrrolidone-grafted SE (SEpvp), combined with an
injection of 10(6) CFU of S. epidermidis or sterile saline. Neither mouse strain 
was susceptible to BAI around SE. IL-1R(-/-) mice with SEpvp implants had a no
abscess formation and a reduced susceptibility to persistent S. epidermidis
infection. The normal foreign body response, characterized by giant-cell
formation and encapsulation, was delayed around SEpvp in wild-type mice but not
in IL-1R(-/-) mice. This coincided with enhanced local IL-4 production in
IL-1R(-/-) mice. These data suggest that inhibition of local IL-1 activity may be
beneficial for the outcome of BAI.
