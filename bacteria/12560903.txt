PURPOSE: The levels of thyroid hormones decrease in septic, critically ill, and
major trauma patients who show a bad prognosis. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effects of thyroid hormone supplementation on the sepsis criteria
and mortality in an experimental sepsis model.
METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar-Albino rats were divided into four experimental
groups. A cecum ligation and puncture was used as a sepsis model. Group I: sham; 
group II: a cecum ligation and puncture (control); group III: a cecum ligation
and puncture +T3 (0.4 microg/100 g body weight/day) intraperitoneally; group IV: 
a cecum ligation and puncture +T4 (1 500 ng/100 g body weight/day)
intramuscularly. The PCO(2), leukocyte count, peritoneal bacterial content,
neutropenia, and mortality rates were assessed in all groups.
RESULTS: The PCO(2) levels decreased only in the control group ( P < 0.05). The
leukocyte counts were lower in the therapy groups ( P < 0.05). The rate of
neutropenia was seen much more in the control group ( P < 0.05). The peritoneal
bacteria content decreased in the therapy groups ( P < 0.05). The mortality rate 
significantly decreased in the thyroid hormone-treated animals ( P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid hormone supplementation in septic rats had a beneficial
effect on the sepsis criteria and also resulted in a lower rate of mortality.
