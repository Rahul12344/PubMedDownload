Although there have been many reports on the relationship between the activation 
of telomerase and carcinogenesis, the role of telomerase in normal cellular
growth is still unclear. Recently, the telomerase upregulation during the process
of liver regeneration has been reported, but the precise time course of its
activity and factors contributing to the activation of telomerase have not yet
been fully elucidated. In the present review, we demonstrate the relationship
between the activation of the telomerase, the cell cycle progression and the
growth-related signaling during the liver regeneration process using an in vivo
mouse partial hepatectomy model. Moreover, the importance of the role of the MAPK
pathways on the telomerase activity in regenerating hepatocytes is also displayed
by using an in vitro culture model. In conclusion, the telomerase activity is
upregulated before hepatocytes enter the S phase, and some growth factors such as
EGF and HGF contribute to this process. The activation of the growth-related
signaling pathways seems to play essential roles in the upregulation of the
telomerase activity.
