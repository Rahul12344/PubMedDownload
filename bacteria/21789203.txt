A small soluble cytochrome c-554 purified from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b
has been purified and analyzed by amino acid sequencing, mass spectrometry,
visible, CD and EPR spectroscopies. It is found to be a mono heme protein with a 
characteristic cytochrome c fold, thus fitting into the class of cytochrome c(2),
which is the bacterial homologue of mitochondrial cytochrome c. The heme iron has
a Histidine/Methionine axial ligation and exhibits a highly anisotropic/axial low
spin (HALS) EPR signal, with a g(max) at 3.40, and ligand field parameters V/ξ = 
0.99, Δ/ξ = 4.57. This gives the rhombicity V/Δ = 0.22. The structural basis for 
this HALS EPR signal in Histidine/Methionine ligated hemes is not resolved. The
ligand field parameters observed for cytochrome c-554 fits the observed pattern
for other cytochromes with similar ligation and EPR behaviour.
