Bionanotechnology aims to impart new properties to materials from unique
functionalities present in biomolecules. However, the promise of
bionanotechnology has not materialized beyond the biomedical field due in large
part to issues of scalability, purity, and cost of manufacturing. In this work we
demonstrate an approach to co-engineer production and system functionality into a
single polypeptide. We designed a system to anchor particles onto hair via a
multifunctional polypeptide composed of two domains, one with affinity to hair
and the other capable of strong interactions with the particle surface. These
strong interactions, exemplified by resistance to anionic surfactants, stem from 
the ability to self-assemble into higher order structures, which were observed by
atomic force microscopy. At the same time, the controlled solubility properties
of the particle binding domain permit the scalable production in Escherichia coli
via inclusion bodies and cost effective purification. We believe this is a
significant advance toward the development of bionanotechnology for industrial
applications.
