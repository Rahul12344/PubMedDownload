Soil samples were taken from different agricultural fields and analyzed for
organochlorine pesticide residues by gas chromatography. The analysis indicated
that the soil samples contained some common organochlorine pesticides DDT, DDD,
DDE, HCH and Aldrin. gamma-HCH was detected as 47.35 ppb whereas the
concentrations of alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, p('),p(')-DDE, o('),p(')-DDT were 38.81,
1.79, 7.10 and 13.30 ppb, respectively, in the same soil. Two Pseudomonas strains
isolated from agricultural soil were found to possess gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane
degrading ability when the isolates were grown in a mineral salt medium
containing gamma-HCH as the sole source of carbon and a number of metabolites
were produced and detected by the gas chromatography. These bacterial isolates
were further tested for carbohydrate and amino acid utilization as well as for
their susceptibility against 10 commonly used antibiotics namely amoxycillin,
chloramphenicol, cloxacillin, doxycycline, methicillin, nalidixic acid, neomycin,
nitrofurantoin, streptomycin and tetracycline. Both the isolates were also
screened for plasmid DNA and found to harbour a single plasmid.
