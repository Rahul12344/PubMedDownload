Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by chronic infection and
inflammation. The inflammatory response in CF is dominated by the activation of
the innate immune system. Bacteria and fungi represent the key pathogens
chronically colonizing the CF airways. In response, innate immune pattern
recognition receptors, expressed by airway epithelial and myeloid cells, sense
the microbial threat and release chemoattractants to recruit large numbers of
neutrophils into CF airways. However, neutrophils fail to efficiently clear the
invading pathogens, but instead release harmful proteases and oxidants and
finally cause tissue injury. Here, we summarize and discuss current concepts and 
controversies in the field of innate immunity in CF lung disease, facing the
ongoing questions of whether inflammation is good or bad in CF and how innate
immune mechanisms could be harnessed therapeutically.
