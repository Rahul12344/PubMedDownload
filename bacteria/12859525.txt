Understanding the regulatory events involved in the activation and inactivation
of T cells is crucial to develop therapeutic approaches for autoimmune diseases
and for organ transplantation. Co-stimulatory signals delivered through the CD28 
receptor and inhibitory signals through CTLA-4 are required for the proper
modulation of T cell responses and the induction and maintenance of peripheral
tolerance. Manipulation of these signals is emerging as a potential strategy to
prevent allograft rejection in different animal models. Recent data on the
compartmentalization and the structural features of CTLA-4 within T cells
provides critical information not only on the molecular basis of T cell
inactivation by CTLA-4, but also on the key requirements for the successful
development of therapeutic strategies targeting this molecule.
