BACKGROUND: Colonization or infection with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria is
considered detrimental to the outcome of neurological and neurosurgical early
rehabilitation patients.
METHODS: In a German multi-center study, 754 neurological early rehabilitation
patients were enrolled and and reviewed in respect to MDR status, length of stay 
(LOS) and the following outcome variables: Barthel Index (BI), Early
Rehabilitation Index (ERI), Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOSE), Coma Remission
Scale (CRS), Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC).
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 68.0 ± 14.8 years. Upon
admission, the following prevalence for MDRs was observed: MRSA (methicillin
resistant staphylococcus aureus) 7.0% (53/754), ESBL- (extended spectrum
beta-lactamase) producing bacteria strains 12.6% (95/754), VRE (vancomycin
resistant enterococci) 2.8% (21/754). Patients colonized or infected with MDR
bacteria (MDR+) were significantly more frequently diagnosed with a critical
illness polyneuropathy - CIP - than non-colonized (MDR-) patients: 29.0% vs.
14.8%. In addition, they were more frequently mechanically ventilated (MDR+:
55/138, 39.9%; MDR- 137/616, 22.2%). MDR+ patients were referred to
rehabilitation earlier, had a longer LOS in early rehabilitation, lower BI on
admission and at discharge, lower ERI on admission and lower CRS at discharge
than MDR- patients. There was a highly significant correlation of the BI upon
admission with the BI at discharge (rs = 0.492, p < 0.001). GOSE at discharge
differed significantly between both groups (χ 2-test, p < 0.01). Perhaps of
greatest importance, mortality among MDR+ was higher in comparison to MDR- (18.1%
vs. 7.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of neurological early rehabilitation patients colonized 
or infected with MDR bacteria including MRSA or ESBL producing strains is
significantly poorer than by non-colonized patients. There is some evidence that 
the poor outcome could be related to the higher morbidity and lower functional
status upon admission.
