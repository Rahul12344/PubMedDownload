BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the host immune response is a pathognomonic feature 
of sepsis. Abnormal physiological conditions are understood to shift efficient
linear splicing of protein-coding RNA towards non-canonical splicing,
characterized by the accumulation of non-coding circularized (circ)RNA. CircRNAs 
remain unexplored in specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during
sepsis. We here sought to identify and characterize circRNA expression in
specific PBMCs of patients with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
relative to healthy subjects.
METHODS: The study comprised a discovery cohort of six critically ill patients
diagnosed with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia and four (age, gender
matched) healthy subjects. PBMCs were isolated, and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting was used to purify CD14+ monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells
for RNA sequencing. CD14+ monocytes from independent six healthy volunteers were 
purified, and total RNA was treated with or without RNase R.
RESULTS: RNA sequencing of sorted CD14+ monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ 
B cells from CAP patients and healthy subjects identified various circRNAs with
predominantly cell-specific expression patterns. CircRNAs were expressed to a
larger extent in monocytes than in CD4+, CD8+ T cells, or B cells. Cells from CAP
patients produced significantly higher levels of circRNA as compared to healthy
subjects. Considering adjusted p values, circVCAN (chr5:83519349-83522309) and
circCHD2 (chr15:93000512-93014909) levels in monocytes were significantly altered
in sepsis. Functional inference per cell-type uncovered pathways mainly attuned
to cell proliferation and cytokine production. In addition, our data does not
support a role for these circRNAs in microRNA sequestration. Quantitative PCR
analysis in purified monocytes from an independent group of healthy volunteers
confirmed the existence of circVCAN and circCHD2.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a benchmark map of circRNA expression dynamics in
specific immune cell subsets of sepsis patients secondary to CAP. CircRNAs were
more abundant in immune cells of sepsis patients relative to healthy subjects.
Further studies evaluating circRNA expression in larger cohorts of sepsis
patients are warranted.
