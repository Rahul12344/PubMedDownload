Several complications may be encountered after rotator cuff (RC) repair. A
thorough knowledge of surgical interventions, normal postoperative findings, and 
postoperative complications is crucial to provide a timely diagnosis, improving
the clinical outcome of patients. Postoperative complications may involve RC,
implanted device, osteochondral tissue, surgical-site infection, peripheral
nerves, soft tissues, and vascular structures. In this review, we discuss the
usual and unusual complications detectable after RC repair.
