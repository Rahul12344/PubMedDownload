The Fanconi anemia pathway is required for repair of DNA interstrand cross-links 
(ICL). Fanconi anemia pathway-deficient cells are hypersensitive to DNA
ICL-inducing drugs such as cisplatin. Conversely, hyperactivation of the Fanconi 
anemia pathway is a mechanism that may underlie cellular resistance to DNA ICL
agents. Modulating FANCD2 monoubiquitination, a key step in the Fanconi anemia
pathway, may be an effective therapeutic approach to conferring cellular
sensitivity to ICL agents. Here, we show that inhibition of the Nedd8 conjugation
system increases cellular sensitivity to DNA ICL-inducing agents.
Mechanistically, the Nedd8 inhibition, either by siRNA-mediated knockdown of
Nedd8-conjugating enzymes or treatment with a Nedd8-activating enzyme inhibitor
MLN4924, suppressed DNA damage-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination and CHK1
phosphorylation. Our data indicate that inhibition of the Fanconi anemia pathway 
is largely responsible for the heightened cellular sensitivity to DNA ICLs upon
Nedd8 inhibition. These results suggest that a combination of Nedd8 inhibition
with ICL-inducing agents may be an effective strategy for sensitizing a subset of
drug-resistant cancer cells.
