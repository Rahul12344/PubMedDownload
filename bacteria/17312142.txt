Naive T cells migrate extensively within lymph node (LN) T zones to scan for
Ag-bearing dendritic cells. However, the extracellular signals controlling T cell
motility in LNs are not well defined. In this study, by real-time imaging of LNs,
we show that the inhibition of Gi signaling in T cells severely impairs their
migration. The chemokine CCL21, a ligand of CCR7, strongly induces chemokinesis
in vitro, and T cell motility in LNs from CCR7 ligand-deficient plt/plt mice was 
reduced. CCR7-deficient T cells in wild-type LNs showed a similar reduction in
motility, and antagonism of CXCR4 function did not further decrease their
motility. The effect of CCR7 or CCR7-ligand deficiency could account for
approximately 40% of the Gi-dependent motility. These results reveal a role for
CCR7 in promoting T cell migration within lymphoid organ T zones, and they
suggest the additional involvement of novel Gi-coupled receptors in promoting T
cell motility at these sites.
