Background & Aims: Gastric Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled
receptor 5 (Lgr5) cells exert important functions during injury and homeostasis. 
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling regulates gastric inflammation and
epithelial homeostasis. We investigated if BMP signaling controls the fate of
Lgr5+ve cells during inflammation.
Methods: The H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase β-subunit promoter was used to
express the BMP inhibitor noggin (Nog) in the stomach (H+/K+-Nog mice).
Inhibition of BMP signaling in Lgr5 cells was achieved by crossing
Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2 (Lgr5-Cre) mice to mice with floxed alleles of BMP
receptor 1A (Lgr5-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox mice). Lgr5/GFP+ve cells were isolated
using flow cytometry. Lineage tracing studies were conducted by crossing Lgr5-Cre
mice to mice that express Nog and tdTomato (Lgr5-Cre;H+/K+-Nog;Rosa26-tdTom).
Infection with Helicobacter felis was used to induce inflammation. Morphology of 
the mucosa was analyzed by H&E staining. Distribution of H+/K+-adenosine
triphosphatase-, IF-, Ki67-, CD44-, CD44v9-, and bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells
was analyzed by immunostaining. Expression of neck and pit cell mucins was
determined by staining with the lectins Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia
lectin II and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1, respectively. Id1, Bmpr1a, Lgr5,
c-Myc, and Cd44 messenger RNAs were measured by quantitative
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Lgr5-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox mice showed diminished expression of Bmpr1a in 
Lgr5/GFP+ve cells. Infection of Lgr5-Cre;Bmpr1aflox/flox mice with H felis led to
enhanced inflammation, increased cell proliferation, parietal cell loss, and to
the development of metaplasia and dysplasia. Infected
Lgr5-Cre;H+/K+-Nog;Rosa26-tdTom mice, but not control mice, showed the presence
of tomato+ve glands lining the lesser curvature that stained positively with
Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia lectin II and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1,
and with anti-IF, -CD44, -CD44v9, and -bromodeoxyuridine antibodies.
Conclusions: Inflammation and inhibition of BMP signaling activate Lgr5+ve cells,
which give rise to metaplastic, dysplastic, proliferating lineages that express
markers of mucus neck and zymogenic cell differentiation.
