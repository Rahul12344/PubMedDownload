Magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria have been widely used in studies of
magnetic domains and in commercial applications. The iron content of
magnetotactic bacteria is ∼100 times higher than that of Escherichia coli.
Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 can still take up iron even at high
intracellular concentrations. Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global
iron-responsive regulator that affects magnetosome formation, iron transport and 
oxygen metabolism. However, the mechanism of iron uptake and homeostasis by M.
gryphiswaldense MSR-1 Fur is not clear. Here, the expression, purification and
crystallization of apo and SeMet Fur from M. gryphiswaldense MSR-1 are reported. 
The crystals belonged to space group C2. Matthews coefficient analysis and
size-exclusion chromatography showed that the asymmetric unit probably contains
one dimer of Fur. Diffraction data were optimized to 1.58 Å resolution for apo
Fur and to 1.9 Å resolution for SeMet Fur.
