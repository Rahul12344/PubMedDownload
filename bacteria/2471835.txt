Strains of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections and meningitis
were characterised by their O:K serotype, haemolysin production,
mannose-resistant haemagglutination, and the serotype of the P-fimbriae. The
P-fimbriae of 71% of the mannose-resistant haemagglutination-positive strains
from urinary tract infection and meningitis could be determined with specific
monoclonal antibodies. Many strains expressed multiple P-fimbriae serotypes. The 
serotypes of P-fimbriae found most frequently among mannose-resistant
haemagglutination-positive E. coli from urinary tract infections were the F11, F7
and F8 fimbriae, and among meningitic strains, F11, F8 and F9 fimbriae. The
expression of certain F-serotypes did not correlate with O:K antigens.
