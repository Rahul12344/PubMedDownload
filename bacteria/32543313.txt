NRBF2 is a RAB7 effector required for autophagosome maturation and mediates the
association of APP-CTFs with active form of RAB7 for degradation.

NRBF2 is a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K)
complex. Our previous study has revealed its role in regulating ATG14-associated 
PtdIns3K activity for autophagosome initiation. In this study, we revealed an
unknown mechanism by which NRBF2 modulates autophagosome maturation and
APP-C-terminal fragment (CTF) degradation. Our data showed that NRBF2 localized
at autolysosomes, and loss of NRBF2 impaired autophagosome maturation.
Mechanistically, NRBF2 colocalizes with RAB7 and is required for generation of
GTP-bound RAB7 by interacting with RAB7 GEF CCZ1-MON1A and maintaining the GEF
activity. Specifically, NRBF2 regulates CCZ1-MON1A interaction with PI3KC3/VPS34 
and CCZ1-associated PI3KC3 kinase activity, which are required for CCZ1-MON1A GEF
activity. Finally, we showed that NRBF2 is involved in APP-CTF degradation and
amyloid beta peptide production by maintaining the interaction between APP and
the CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 module to facilitate the maturation of APP-containing
vesicles. Overall, our study revealed a pivotal role of NRBF2 as a new RAB7
effector in modulating autophagosome maturation, providing insight into the
molecular mechanism of NRBF2-PtdIns3K in regulating RAB7 activity for
macroautophagy/autophagy maturation and Alzheimer disease-associated protein
degradation.
