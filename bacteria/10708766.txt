ArsA protein is the soluble subunit of the Ars anion pump in the Escherichia coli
membrane which extrudes arsenite or antimonite from the cytoplasm. The molecular 
weight of the subunit is 63 kDa. In the cell it hydrolyzes ATP, and the energy
released is used by the membrane-bound subunit ArsB to transport the substrates
across the membrane. We have obtained two-dimensional crystals of ArsA in the
presence of arsenite on negatively-charged lipid monolayer composed of DMPS and
DOPC. These crystals have been studied using electron microscopy of
negatively-stained specimens followed by image processing. The projection map
obtained at 2.4 nm resolution reveals a ring-like structure with threefold
symmetry. Many molecular assemblies with the same ring-shape and dimensions were 
also seen dispersed on electron microscopy grids, prepared directly from purified
ArsA protein solution. Size-exclusion chromatography of the protein sample with
arsenite present revealed that the majority of the protein particles in solution 
have a molecular weight of about 180 kDa. Based on these experiments, we conclude
that in solution the ArsA ATPase with substrate bound is mainly in a trimeric
form.
