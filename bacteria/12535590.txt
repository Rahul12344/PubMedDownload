Orchards (n=13) were sampled as part of a larger survey investigating
agrichemical residues (pesticides and trace elements) in cropping soils in the
Auckland region, New Zealand. SigmaDDT concentrations in orchard soils ranged
from <0.03 to 24.41 mg kg(-1). DDT (o,p'- and p,p'-) comprised at least 40% of
the SigmaDDT residues in 67% of orchards in which DDT residues were detected.
There was a highly significant negative correlation (-0.924, P<0.001) between
copper concentration (21-490 mg kg-1) and the ratio of DDE:DDT (0.4-5.2) in pip
and stonefruit orchard soils. In further investigations involving five pip and
stone fruit orchard sites and one grazing paddock it was found that soil
respiration and the ratio of soil microbial carbon to soil carbon (%Cmic/Org-C)
in orchard soils decreased with increasing copper concentration. These findings
are consistent with the conclusion that elevated soil copper concentrations in
pip and stone fruit orchard soils in the Auckland region may have reduced the
ability of the indigenous soil microbial community to degrade DDT to DDE
