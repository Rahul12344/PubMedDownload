The normal thymus contributes to T lymphocytes differentiation and induction of
tolerance to self-antigens. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by abnormal
thymic hyperplasia. To assess the potential influence of MG-thymus on the
differentiation of T lymphocytes differentiation, we used the MG-thymus
transplanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice model to evaluate the
human cord blood stem cells differentiation. Thymus fragments from MG patient and
human cord blood stem cells were transplanted into SCID mice successively. SCID
mice were observed to develop sustained human T lymphocytes and a functional
anti-tumor immune. The levels of various T cell subsets in SCID mice with
MG-thymus were different from that of control group. Among that, the frequency of
CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells was significant lower in SCID mice with MG-thymus. The
deficiency of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells seens to contribute to the pathogenesis of
MG.
