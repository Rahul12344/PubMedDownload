Loss of ζ-associated protein 70 (Zap70) results in severe immunodeficiency in
humans and mice because of the critical role of Zap70 in T-cell receptor (TCR)
signalling. Here we describe a novel mouse strain generated by
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, with the reduced protein stability (rps)
mutation in Zap70. The A243V rps mutation resulted in decreased Zap70 protein and
a reduced duration of TCR-induced calcium responses, equivalent to that induced
by a 50% decrease in catalytically active Zap70. The reduction of signalling
through Zap70 was insufficient to substantially perturb thymic differentiation of
conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells, although Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells
demonstrated altered thymic production and peripheral homeostasis. Despite the
mild phenotype, the Zap70(A243V) variant lies just above the functional threshold
for TCR signalling competence, as T cells relying on only a single copy of the
Zap70(rps) allele for TCR signalling demonstrated no intracellular calcium
response to TCR stimulation. This addition to the Zap70 allelic series indicates 
that a rate-limiting threshold for Zap70 protein levels exists at which
signalling capacity switches from nearly intact to effectively null.
