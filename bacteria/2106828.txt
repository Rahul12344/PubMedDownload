The effect of adaptation to saline growth of a fresh water cyanobacterium
Synechococcus 6311 on components of the cytoplasmic membranes and thylakoids was 
investigated. Significant changes in membrane surface charge, lipid, fatty acid, 
and carotenoid composition were observed upon transfer of the cells from a low
salt (0.015 M NaCl) to a high salt (0.50 M NaCl) growth medium. Very similar
changes in the polar lipid classes and fatty acid composition were observed in
both membranes, but changes in fluidity and surface charge and a significant
shift in the protein to lipid ratio were only apparent in the cytoplasmic
membranes. The fluidity and surface charge data correlate well with functional
studies and we can attribute the cytoplasmic membrane as the major site of
interaction and adaptation to the saline environment.
