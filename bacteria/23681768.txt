Chasing the active impurity: In the validation of a screening hit it was
discovered that a polymeric trace impurity was responsible for the biological
activity. Such a side product can be formed with similar compounds. During the
investigations it was discovered that the negatively charged macromolecule
interacts very efficiently with the protein surface of E. coli RNAP via
electrostatic interactions.
