Helicobacter pylori, present in half of the world's population, is a very
successful pathogen. It can survive for decades in the human stomach with few
obvious consequences to the host. However, it is also the cause of gastric
diseases ranging from gastritis to ulcers to gastric cancer and has been
classified a type 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization. We have
previously shown that phosphorylation of a 145-kDa protein and activation of
signal transduction pathways are associated with the attachment of H. pylori to
gastric cells. Here we identify the 145-kDa protein as the H. pylori CagA
protein. We also show that CagA is necessary to induce a growth-factor-like
phenotype (hummingbird) in host gastric cells similar to that induced by
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Additionally, we identify a second cellular
phenotype induced after attachment by H. pylori, which we call SFA (stress fiber 
associated). SFA is CagA independent and is produced by type I and type II H.
pylori.
