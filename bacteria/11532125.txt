Group A streptococcus (GAS) induces its own entry into eukaryotic cells in vitro 
and in vivo. Fibronectin (Fn) bound to protein F1, a GAS surface protein, acts as
a bridge connecting the bacterium to host cell integrins. This triggers
clustering of integrins, which acquire a polar pattern of distribution similar to
that of protein F1 on the GAS surface. A unique and transient adhesion complex is
formed at the site of GAS entry, which does not contain alpha-actinin. Vinculin
is recruited to the site of GAS entry but is not required for uptake. The
invading GAS recruits focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is required for uptake
and is tyrosine phosphorylated. The Src kinases, Src, Yes and Fyn, enhance the
efficiency of GAS uptake but are not absolutely required for GAS entry. In
addition, Rac and Cdc42, but not Rho, are required for the entry process. We
suggest a model in which integrin engagement by Fn-occupied protein F1 triggers
two independent signalling pathways. One is initiated by FAK recruitment and
tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the other is initiated by the recruitment and
activation of Rac. The two pathways subsequently converge to trigger actin
rearrangement leading to bacterial uptake.
