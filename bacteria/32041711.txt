Antimalarial drug resistance in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite poses a
constant challenge for drug development. To mitigate this risk, new antimalarial 
medicines should be developed as fixed-dose combinations. Assessing the
pharmacodynamic interactions of potential antimalarial drug combination partners 
during early phases of development is essential in developing the targeted
parasitological and clinical profile of the final drug product. Here, we have
studied the combination of M5717, a P. falciparum translation elongation factor 2
inhibitor, and pyronaridine, an inhibitor of hemozoin formation. Our test cascade
consisted of in vitro isobolograms as well as in vivo studies in the P.
falciparum severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. We also analyzed
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, including genomic sequencing of
recrudescent parasites. We observed no pharmacokinetic interactions with the
combination of M5717 and pyronaridine. M5717 did not negatively impact the rate
of kill of the faster-acting pyronaridine, and the latter was able to suppress
the selection of M5717-resistant mutants, as well as significantly delay the
recrudescence of parasites both with suboptimal and optimal dosing regimens.
