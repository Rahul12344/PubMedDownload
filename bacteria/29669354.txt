BACKGROUND: Our aims were to assess the real life effectiveness and safety of the
new bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in a large population of patients
infected by Helicobacter pylori.
METHODS: Consecutive dyspeptic H. pylori-positive patients were enrolled, both
naïve for treatment and already unsuccessfully treated. Patients were treated
with Pylera® 3 capsules 4 times/daily plus omeprazole 20 mg or esomeprazole 40 mg
2 times/daily for 10 days. Eradication was confirmed using a urea-breath test (at
least 30 days after the end of the treatment). Efficacy and safety were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were treated. H. pylori eradication was achieved
in 316 (90.5%, 95% CIs 80.8-1.0) patients in the intention-to-treat population,
and in 93.5% (95% CIs 83.5-1.0) in the per-protocol population. No difference in 
the eradication rate was found between naïve and previously treated patients
(91.3 vs. 90.0%, p = 0.901). Adverse events occurred in 55 patients (15.8%, 95%
CIs 11.9-20.1). Five patients discontinued treatment: 2 patients suffered from
severe abdominal pain, one patient from headache, one patient from diarrhea, and 
one patient from diffuse urticarial rush.
CONCLUSIONS: Pylera® achieved a remarkable eradication rate in real life both as 
first treatment and as a rescue therapy, with a good safety profile.
