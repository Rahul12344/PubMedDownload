Similarities between DDT and pyrethroid insecticides have led to widespread
concern that cross-resistance between them might limit the usefulness of the
latter. Both types of insecticide have similarities in chemical structure, both
have a negative temperature coefficient (ie. they are more active at lower
temperatures), both act as neurotoxins on sodium channels, and both produce the
twin effects of knockdown and kill. As discussed by Tom Miller (see pages S8-S12)
there is firm evidence for Pyrethroid resistance in some species of medical and
veterinary importance - especially in the horn fly, Haemotobia irritans. But in
the case of anopheline mosquitoes, the evidence for pyrethroid resistance is much
less strong. As Colin Malcolm explains here, a critical analysis of available
data indicates that true physiological resistance of anophelines to pyrethroids
is much less widespread than previous commentaries suggest. Moreover, the risk of
cross-resistance between pyrethroids and DDT may have been over-emphasized, since
different resistance mechanisms appear to be involved.
