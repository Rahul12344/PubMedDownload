Lipid-A was isolated by mild acid hydrolysis from lipopolysaccharides extracted
from cells of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, strain SMR1, and from two mutants
deficient in the biosynthesis of rhamnose (rmlB⁻ and rmlC⁻). Structural analyzes 
were carried out using MALDI-TOF and derivatization by per-O-trimethylsilylation 
followed by GC-MS in order to determine monosaccharide and fatty acid
composition. De-O-acylation was also performed to determine the presence of
N-linked fatty acids. Lipid-A from H. seropedicae SMR1 showed a major structure
comprising 2-amino-2-deoxy-glucopyranose-(1→6)-2-amino-2-deoxy-glucopyranose
phosphorylated at C4' and C1 positions, each carrying a unit of
4-amino-4-deoxy-arabinose. C2 and C2' positions were substituted by amide-linked 
3-hydroxy-dodecanoic acids. Both rhamnose-defective mutants showed similar
structure for their lipid-A moieties, except for the lack of
4-amino-4-deoxy-arabinose units attached to phosphoryl groups.
