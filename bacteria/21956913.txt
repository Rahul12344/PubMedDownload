An increasing number of dominantly inherited diseases have now been linked with
expansion of short repeats within specific genes. Although some of these
expansions affect protein function or result in haploinsufficiency, a significant
portion cause pathogenesis through production of toxic RNA molecules that alter
cellular metabolism. In this review, we examine the criteria that influence
toxicity of these mutant RNAs and discuss new developments in therapeutic
approaches.
