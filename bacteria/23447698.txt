Intestinal colonization by antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecium is the first
step in a process that can lead to infections in hospitalized patients. By
comparative genome analysis and subsequent polymerase chain reaction screening,
we identified a locus that encodes a putative phosphotransferase system (PTS).
The PTS locus was widespread in isolates from hospital outbreaks of infection
(84.2%) and nonoutbreak clinical infections (66.0%) but absent from human
commensal isolates. Deletion of pstD, which is predicted to encode the enzyme IID
subunit of this PTS, significantly impaired the ability of E. faecium to colonize
the murine intestinal tract during antibiotic treatment. This is the first
description of a determinant that contributes to intestinal colonization in
clinical E. faecium strains.
