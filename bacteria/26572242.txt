We have applied a serologic proteomic workflow involving three complementary MS
approaches to a tissue-specific Kras(G12D) -knockin mouse model of pancreatic
cancer that consistently forms precancerous lesions by 4 months of age. The three
proteomics applications were highly complementary and allowed us to survey the
entire range of low to high molecular weight serologic proteins. Combined, we
identified 121 (49↓, 72↑) unique and statistically relevant serologic biomarkers 
with 88% previously reported to be associated with cancer and 38% specifically
correlated with pancreatic cancer. Four markers, lysozyme C2, cytokeratin 19,
Serpina1A and Pcf11, were further verified by Western blotting. When applying
systems analysis, the top-associated gene ontology functions were tied to wound
healing, RXR signaling, growth, differentiation and innate immune activation
through the JAK/STAT pathway. Upon further investigation of the apparent immune
response using a multiplex cytokine screen, we found that IFN-γ, VEGF and GM-CSF 
were significantly increased in serum from the Kras(G12D) animals compared to
littermate controls. By combining three complementary MS applications, we were
able to survey the native intact peptidome and the global proteome in parallel,
unveiling pathways that may be biologically relevant to promotion of pancreatic
cancer progression and serologic markers of noninvasive early-stage neoplasia.
