Antimicrobial peptides such as human β-defensins (hBDs) and cathelicidins are
critical for protection against infection and can be induced by activation of
TLRs, a pathway that also activates cyclooxygenase(Cox)-2 expression. We
hypothesized that Cox-2 is induced by TLR activation and is necessary for optimal
AMP production, and that inhibitors of Cox-2 may therefore inhibit antimicrobial 
action. Normal human keratinocytes (NHEKs) stimulated with a TLR2/6 ligand,
macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2, or a TLR3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic
acid, increased Cox-2 mRNA and protein and increased PGE(2), a product of Cox-2. 
Treatment with a Cox-2 selective inhibitor (SC-58125) or Cox-2 small interfering 
RNA attenuated hBD2 and hBD3 production in NHEKs when stimulated with
macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, or UVB (15 
mJ/cm(2)), but it did not attenuate vitamin D3-induced cathelicidin. SC-58125
also inhibited TLR-dependent NF-κB activation. Conversely, treatment with
Cox-derived prostanoids PGD(2) or 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-PGJ(2) induced hBD3 or hBD2
and hBD3, respectively. The functional significance of these observations was
seen in NHEKs that showed reduced anti-staphylococcal activity when treated with 
a Cox-2 inhibitor. These findings demonstrate a critical role for Cox-2 in hBD
production and suggest that the use of Cox-2 inhibitors may adversely influence
the risk for bacterial infection.
