Here, we describe the capacity of Bacillus anthracis peptidoglycan (BaPGN) to
trigger an antimicrobial response in human white blood cells (WBCs). Analysis of 
freshly isolated human blood cells found that monocytes and neutrophils, but not 
B and T cells, were highly responsive to BaPGN and produced a variety of
cytokines and chemokines. This BaPGN-induced response was suppressed by anthrax
lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET), with the most pronounced effect on human 
monocytes, and this corresponded with the higher levels of anthrax toxin receptor
1 (ANTXR1) in these cells than in neutrophils. The supernatant from BaPGN-treated
cells altered the growth of B. anthracis Sterne, and this effect was blocked by
LT, but not by ET. An FtsX mutant of B. anthracis known to be resistant to the
antimicrobial effects of interferon-inducible Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR)-negative CXC
chemokines was not affected by the BaPGN-induced antimicrobial effects.
Collectively, these findings describe a system in which BaPGN triggers expression
of antimicrobial factors in human WBCs and reveal a distinctive role, not shared 
with ET, in LT's capacity to suppress this response.
