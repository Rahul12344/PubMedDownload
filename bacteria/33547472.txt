INTRODUCTION: Escherichia coli ST131 is the most common multidrug-resistant (MDR)
E. coli clone causing bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Calgary. This study
describes patient characteristics and spatial distribution of ST131 subclades C1 
and C2 causing BSIs in Calgary.
METHODS: E. coli from blood (n = 685) obtained in Calgary, Canada, (2016) were
PCR screened for ST131 and positives (n = 141) underwent whole genome sequencing.
Patient characteristics were analysed using Fisher's Exact/t-tests and spatial
analysis was used to identify clusters.
RESULTS: Overall, 21% of E. coli was identified as ST131 and clade C dominated
the population. ST131-C2 was associated with blaCTX-M-15 and significantly more
MDR than ST131-C1. The spatial distribution in Calgary showed that ST131-C1 was
mainly present in long-term care (LTC) residents whereas ST131-C2 clustered in a 
specific North East (NE) Calgary sector comprising of six neighbourhoods without 
LTC centres. This NE sector has high immigration and travel rates from the Indian
subcontinent.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that ST131 C subclades have different geographical
distribution patterns in Calgary. We believe that recent travel to and
immigration from certain high-risk regions for antimicrobial resistance are
responsible for the ST131-C2 NE Calgary clustering pattern.
