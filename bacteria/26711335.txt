Ogg1 and Mutyh DNA glycosylases cooperate to prevent mutations caused by 8-oxoG, 
a major premutagenic DNA lesion associated with cognitive decline. We have
examined behavior and cognitive function in mice deficient of these glycosylases.
Ogg1(-/-)Mutyh(-/-) mice were more active and less anxious, with impaired
learning ability. In contrast, Mutyh(-/-) mice showed moderately improved memory.
We observed no apparent change in genomic 8-oxoG levels, suggesting that Ogg1 and
Mutyh play minor roles in global repair in adult brain. Notably, transcriptome
analysis of hippocampus revealed that differentially expressed genes in the
mutants belong to pathways known to be involved in anxiety and cognition. Esr1
targets were upregulated, suggesting a role of Ogg1 and Mutyh in repression of
Esr1 signaling. Thus, beyond their involvement in DNA repair, Ogg1 and Mutyh
regulate hippocampal gene expression related to cognition and behavior,
suggesting a role for the glycosylases in regulating adaptive behavior.
