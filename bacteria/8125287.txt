Here, we describe the construction of plasmid vectors facilitating expression of 
cloned genes in bacteria and in cells of mammalian and insect origin. Two types
of multiple cloning site (MCS) were designed based on the MCS in the expression
vector lambda gt11Sfi-Not. In the first set of vectors a start Met codon was
included in the same reading frame as in lambda gt11Sfi-Not to support expression
of partial cDNA clones. Thus a cDNA insert of lambda gt11Sfi-Not could be
shuttled among the new vectors for expression. The other set of vectors without a
start codon were suitable for expression of cDNA carrying their own start Met
codon. By Western blot analysis and by transactivation of a reporter plasmid in
co-transfections we show that cDNA is very efficiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells
under control of the elongation factor 1 alpha promoter.
