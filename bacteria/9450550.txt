We have purified a form of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) from HeLa cell nuclei, in 
which the phosphatase is complexed to a regulatory subunit termed p99. We report 
here the cloning and characterisation of the p99 component. p99 mRNA is widely
expressed in human tissues and immunofluorescence analysis with anti-p99
antibodies showed a punctate nucleoplasmic staining with additional accumulations
within the nucleolus. The C-terminus of p99 contains seven RGG RNA-binding
motifs, followed by eleven decapeptide repeats containing six or more of the
following conserved residues (GHRPHEGPGG), and finally a putative zinc finger
domain. Recombinant p99 suppresses the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 
by > 90% and the canonical PP1-binding motif on p99 (residues 396-401) is unusual
in that the phenylalanine residue is replaced by tryptophan.
