BACKGROUND & AIMS: CD1d-restricted natural killer (NK) T cells are a subset of
immunoregulatory T cells that comprise type I (express the semi-invariant T-cell 
receptor [TCR] and can be detected using the α-galactosylceramide/CD1d tetramer) 
and type II (express diverse TCRs and cannot be directly identified). Studies in 
mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease revealed a complex role for type I NKT
cells in the development of colitis. Type II NKT cells have been associated with 
intestinal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: To investigate whether dysregulation of type II NKT cells, caused by
increased expression of CD1d, can contribute to colitis, we generated transgenic 
mice that express high levels of CD1d and a TCR from an autoreactive, type II NKT
cell (CD1dTg/24αβTg mice).
RESULTS: CD1dTg/24αβTg mice had reduced numbers of 24αβ T cells compared with
24αβTg mice, indicating that negative selection increases among type II NKT cells
engaged by abundant self-antigen. The residual 24αβ T cells in CD1dTg/24αβTg mice
had an altered surface phenotype and acquired a cytokine profile distinct from
that of equivalent cells in 24αβTg mice. Interestingly, CD1dTg/24αβTg mice
spontaneously developed colitis; adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that
type II NKT cells that develop in the context of increased CD1d expression are
pathogenic.
CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant type II NKT cell responses directly contribute to
intestinal inflammation in mice, indicating the importance of CD1d expression
levels in the development and regulation of type II NKT cells.
