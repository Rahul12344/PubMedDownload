There is increasing evidence that reversible phosphorylation of histidine
residues regulates numerous important cellular processes. The first protein
histidine phosphatase (PHP) from vertebrates was discovered just recently. Here, 
we report on amino acids and domains essential for activity of PHP. Point
mutations of conserved residues and deletions of the N- and C-termini of PHP were
analyzed using [(32)P-his]ATP-citrate lyase as a substrate. Individual or joint
replacement of all cysteine residues by alanine did not affect PHP activity.
Deletion of 9 N-terminal amino acids resulted in inactive PHP. Furthermore, only 
4 C-terminal residues could be deleted without losing PHP activity. Single or
multiple mutations of the glycine-rich domain (Gly(75), Gly(77)) of a putative
nucleotide binding site of PHP (GxGxxG/S) caused inactivation of PHP. Wildtype
PHP could be labeled with [alpha-(32)P]ATP. Such radiolabeling was not detectable
for catalytically inactive PHP-G75A and PHP-G77A. These data suggest further
studies on the interaction between PHP and ATP.
