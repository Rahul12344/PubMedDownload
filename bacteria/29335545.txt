Lipids, either endogenously synthesized or exogenous, have been linked to human
cancer. Here we found that PML is frequently co-deleted with PTEN in metastatic
human prostate cancer (CaP). We demonstrated that conditional inactivation of Pml
in the mouse prostate morphs indolent Pten-null tumors into lethal metastatic
disease. We identified MAPK reactivation, subsequent hyperactivation of an
aberrant SREBP prometastatic lipogenic program, and a distinctive lipidomic
profile as key characteristic features of metastatic Pml and Pten double-null
CaP. Furthermore, targeting SREBP in vivo by fatostatin blocked both tumor growth
and distant metastasis. Importantly, a high-fat diet (HFD) induced lipid
accumulation in prostate tumors and was sufficient to drive metastasis in a
nonmetastatic Pten-null mouse model of CaP, and an SREBP signature was highly
enriched in metastatic human CaP. Thus, our findings uncover a prometastatic
lipogenic program and lend direct genetic and experimental support to the notion 
that a Western HFD can promote metastasis.
