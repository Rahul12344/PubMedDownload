Pneumocystis jiroveci is an important pathogen in patients undergoing SOT and
HSCT. Universal prophylaxis is recommended for all adults and children with SOT
and HSCT, considering that its use significantly reduces the occurrence and
mortality associated with pneumonia by this agent. The drug of choice is
cotrimoxazole (A1) three times a week, low-dose scheme, that has proved equally
effective and better tolerated than the daily regimen and/or at high doses.
Prophylaxis starts 7 to 14 days post transplant in SOT recipients and
post-implant in HSCT, with an average duration of 6 months except in liver and
lung transplant as in HSCT with significant degree of immunosuppression, that
lasts for 1 year. Alternatives for prophylaxis are dapsone (B2), aerosolized
pentamidine (B2) and atovaquone (C2).
