The murine chemokine receptor 2 (mCXCR2) controls resistance to urinary tract
infection. We have previously shown that mCXCR2 knockout mice develop severe
acute pyelonephritis and renal tissue damage with sub-epithelial neutrophil
entrapment. In this study we examined the relative importance of neutrophil- and 
epithelial-specific mCXCR2 expression for bacterial clearance in bone marrow
chimeric mice infected with uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Mice expressing
mCXCR2 on their neutrophils responded rapidly to experimental urinary tract
infection, clearing the infection from the kidneys. Mice lacking epithelial
mCXCR2, however, showed delayed exit of neutrophils from the tissues. Mice
lacking neutrophil mCXCR2 and mice with no mCXCR2 had no neutrophil recruitment
and bacterial clearance. Mice expressing mCXCR2 only in their epithelial cells
had a transient epithelial chemokine response; however, neutrophil recruitment
was inhibited and bacteria grew without constraint. Our study shows that the
expression of mCXCR2 on hematopoietic cells was crucial for bacterial clearance, 
while its expression on non-bone marrow-derived cells influenced the neutrophil
response. These results emphasize the importance of mCXCR2 for the innate defense
against urinary tract infection.
