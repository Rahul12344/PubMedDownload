CD40 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and
autoimmunity. B cell CD40 directly activates cells, which can result in
autoantibody production. T cells can also express CD40, with an increased
frequency and amount of expression seen in CD4(+) T lymphocytes of autoimmune
mice, including T cells from mice with collagen-induced arthritis. However, the
mechanisms of T cell CD40 function have not been clearly defined. To test the
hypothesis that CD40 can serve as a costimulatory molecule on T lymphocytes,
CD40(+) T cells from collagen-induced arthritis mice were examined in parallel
with mouse and human T cell lines transfected with CD40. CD40 served as
effectively as CD28 in costimulating TCR-mediated activation, including induction
of kinase and transcription factor activities and production of cytokines. An
additional enhancement was seen when both CD40 and CD28 signals were combined
with AgR stimulation. These findings reveal potent biologic functions for T cell 
CD40 and suggest an additional means for amplification of autoimmune responses.
