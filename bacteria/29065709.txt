Cow's milk fermented with Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 (FM-CBAL74) exerts a
preventive effect against infectious diseases in children. We evaluated if this
effect is at least in part related to a direct modulation of non-immune and
immune defence mechanisms in human enterocytes. Human enterocytes (Caco-2) were
stimulated for 48 h with FM-CBAL74 at different concentrations. Cell growth was
assessed by colorimetric assay; cell differentiation (assessed by lactase
expression), tight junction proteins (zonula occludens1 and occludin), mucin 2,
and toll-like receptor (TRL) pathways were analysed by real-time PCR; innate
immunity peptide synthesis, beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) and cathelicidin (LL-37) were
evaluated by ELISA. Mucus layer thickness was analysed by histochemistry. FMCBA
L74 stimulated cell growth and differentiation, tight junction proteins and mucin
2 expression, and mucus layer thickness in a dose-dependent fashion. A
significant stimulation of HBD-2 and LL-37 synthesis, associated with a
modulation of TLR pathway, was also observed. FM-CBAL74 regulates non-immune and 
immune defence mechanisms through a direct interaction with the enterocytes.
These effects could be involved in the preventive action against infectious
diseases demonstrated by this fermented product in children.
