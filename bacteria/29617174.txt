We previously reported that mice intracerebrally inoculated with the
mouse-adapted scrapie strain ME7 have markedly diminished T zones in the spleen
due to the decreased expression of CCL19 and CCL21. In addition, follicular
dendritic cell networks in germinal centers were larger in ME7-infected spleens
compared to uninfected spleens. As an extension of that study, we set out to
determine how ME7 infection affects spleen structure and follicular helper T
(Tfh) cell responses in mice. For this study, mice were intraperitoneally
inoculated with brain homogenate of the ME7 inoculum and spleens were analyzed
50, 130, and 200Â days after inoculation and compared with those from uninfected
mice. The result showed that ME7- infected mice had increased Tfh cell responses 
which were maintained until end-stage prion disease. Although CD4 T cells
decreased in white pulps, they increased in germinal centers, and expressed
higher levels of the Tfh-related genes, such as Bcl6, Il21, Cxcr5, Icos, and
Pdcd1. In addition, ME7-infected spleens had increased numbers of CD4 memory T
cells. These data indicate that although ME7 infection led to impaired splenic
white pulp structure, CD4 memory T cells were increased and Tfh cell responses
were required and prolonged to provide help for the replication and accumulation 
of pathogenic prion protein in germinal centers.
