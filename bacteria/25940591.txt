BACKGROUND: Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is an idiosyncratic reaction to
infection with Histoplasma capsulatum with a prevalence of 3:100,000 people
infected. The rarity of post-histoplasmosis fibrosing mediastinitis (PHFM) in
areas where H. capsulatum is endemic suggests that an abnormal immunological host
response may be responsible for the development of fibrosis. Our group previously
reported an association between subjects with PHFM and human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-A*02. We sought to confirm or extend those findings with application of
high resolution HLA typing in a cohort of subjects with PHFM.
METHODS: High-resolution HLA typing was performed on DNA samples from a new
cohort 34 patients with PHFM. Control cohorts included 707 subjects from the
"European American" subset of the National Marrow Donor Program(Â®) (NMDP) and 700
subjects from Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI). The carriage frequencies of the HLA
alleles identified in the PHFM, NMDP, and DCI cohorts were calculated and then
all were compared.
RESULTS: We found an increase in the carriage frequency of HLA-DQB1*04:02 in PHFM
subjects relative to the controls (0.15 versus 0.07 in DCI and 0.05 in NMDP; p = 
0.08 and 0.03). Multiple logistic regression showed that DQB1*04:02 was
statistically significant (p = 0.04), while DQB1*03:02 and C*03:04 had point
estimates of OR > 1, though they did not reach statistical significance. The
HLA-A*02 association was not replicated.
CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQB1*04:02 is associated with PHFM, which supports the premise
that an aberrant host immune response contributes to the development of PHFM.
