Flavobacterium psychrophilum, a Gram-negative bacterium, is the etiological agent
of rainbow trout fry syndrome and bacterial cold water disease, septicemic
infections in reared salmonids. In humans Flavobacterium spp. have been
associated with neonatal meningitis and septicemia, catheter-associated
bacteremia, and pneumonia. Recently, several F. psychrophilum surface molecules, 
including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been implicated in its pathogenesis and 
identified as potential vaccine and diagnostic candidate macromolecules. Studies 
on the LPS produced by the bacterium are reported herein. The structure of the
antigenic O-polysaccharide contained in the LPS of F. psychrophilum was deduced
by the application of analytical NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, glycose and
methylation analysis, and partial hydrolysis degradations, and was found to be an
unbranched polymer of trisaccharide repeating units composed of L-rhamnose
(L-Rhap), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-L-fucose (L-FucpNAc) and
2-acetamido-4-((3S,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhexanamido)-2,4-dideoxy-D-quinovose
(D-Quip2NAc4NR, 2-N-acetyl-4-N-((3S,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoyl)-D-bacillosamine)
(1 : 1 : 1) and having the structure:
-->4)-alpha-L-FucpNAc-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Quip2NAc4NR-(1-->2)- alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->
where R is (3S,5S)-CH3CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CO-.
