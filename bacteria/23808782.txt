Hobnail hemangioma is a benign vascular lesion and intraoral of the lesions are
relatively rare. Histopathologically, it shows distinctive biphasic pattern with 
vascular channels lined by endothelial cells showing characteristic "hobnail"
cytomorphology. Since hobnail hemangioma shares similar clinical and
histopathologic features with many other benign and malignant vascular tumors,
accurate diagnosis is mandatory for proper treatment and prognosis. In the
present study, emphasis was given to discuss the differential diagnosis and
delineate the hobnail hemangioma from other vascular lesions. Further,
immunohistochemical study was performed which showed strong immunopositivity for 
CD31 and factor VIII in all endothelial cells lining the vascular channels. CD34 
was moderately immunopositive and vascular endothelial growth factor was
negative.
