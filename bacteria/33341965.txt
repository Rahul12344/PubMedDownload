BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Red blood cell concentrates (RBCC) are susceptible to 
bacterial contamination despite cold storage. A reliable evaluation of strategies
to minimize the risk of RBCC-associated bacterial transmission requires the use
of suitable reference bacteria. Already existing Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria
Reference Strains (TRBRS) for platelet concentrates fail to grow in RBCC.
Consequently, the ISBT TTID, Working Party, Bacterial Subgroup, conducted an
international study on TRBRS for RBCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six bacterial strains (Listeria monocytogenes PEI-A-199,
Serratia liquefaciens PEI-A-184, Serratia marcescens PEI-B-P-56, Pseudomonas
fluorescens PEI-B-P-77, Yersinia enterocolitica PEI-A-105, Yersinia
enterocolitica PEI-A-176) were distributed to 15 laboratories worldwide for
enumeration, identification, and determination of growth kinetics in RBCC at days
7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 of storage after low-count spiking (10-25 CFU/RBCC).
RESULTS: Bacterial proliferation in RBCC was obtained for most strains, except
for S. marcescens, which grew only at 4 of 15 laboratories. S. liquefaciens,
S. marcescens, P. fluorescens and the two Y. enterocolitica strains reached the
stationary phase between days 14 and 21 of RBCC storage with a bacterial
concentration of approximately 109  CFU/ml. L. monocytogenes displayed slower
growth kinetics reaching 106 -107  CFU/ml after 42 days.
CONCLUSION: The results illustrate the importance of conducting comprehensive
studies to establish well-characterized reference strains, which can be a tool to
assess strategies and methods used to ameliorate blood safety. The WHO Expert
Committee on Biological Standardization adopted the five successful strains as
official RBCC reference strains. Our study also highlights the relevance of
visual inspection to interdict contaminated RBC units.
