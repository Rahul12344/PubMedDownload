An arginine residue in loop 4 connecting beta strand 4 and alpha-helix 4 is
conserved in glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) xylanases. The arginine
residues, Arg(204) in xylanase A from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (XynA) and
Arg(196) in xylanase B from Clostridium stercorarium F9 (XynB), were replaced by 
glutamic acid, lysine, or glutamine residues (XynA R204E, K and Q, and XynB
R196E, K and Q). The pH-k(cat)/K(m) and the pH-k(cat) relationships of these
mutant enzymes were measured. The pK(e2) and pK(es2) values calculated from these
curves were 8.59 and 8.29 (R204E), 8.59 and 8.10 (R204K), 8.61 and 8.19 (R204Q), 
7.42 and 7.19 (R196E), 7.49 and 7.18 (R196K), and 7.86 and 7.38 (R196Q)
respectively. Only the pK(es2) value of arginine derivatives was less than those 
of the wild types (8.49 and 9.39 [XynA] and 7.62 and 7.82 [XynB]). These results 
suggest that the conserved arginine residue in GH10 xylanases increases the pK(a)
value of the proton donor Glu during substrate binding. The arginine residue is
considered to clamp the proton donor and subsite +1 to prevent structural change 
during substrate binding.
