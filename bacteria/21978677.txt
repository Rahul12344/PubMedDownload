3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) synthase catalyses the first 
step of the shikimate pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of
aromatic amino acids in microorganisms and plants. This enzyme catalyses an aldol
reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate and D-erythrose 4-phosphate to generate
DAH7P. Both 2-deoxyerythrose 4-phosphate and 3-deoxyerythrose 4-phosphate were
synthesised and tested as alternative substrates for the enzyme. Both compounds
were found to be substrates for the DAH7P synthases from Escherichia coli,
Pyrococcus furiosus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, consistent with an acyclic
mechanism for the enzyme for which neither C2 nor C3 hydroxyl groups are required
for catalysis. The enzymes all showed greater tolerance for the loss of the C2
hydroxyl group than the C3 hydroxyl group.
