The mammalian peripheral stalk subunits of the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases
(V-ATPases) possess several isoforms (C1, C2, E1, E2, G1, G2, G3, a1, a2, a3, and
a4), which may play significant role in regulating ATPase assembly and
disassembly in different tissues. To better understand the structure and function
of V-ATPase, we expressed and purified several isoforms of the human V-ATPase
peripheral stalk: E1G1, E1G2, E1G3, E2G1, E2G2, E2G3, C1, C2, H, a1NT, and a2NT. 
Here, we investigated and characterized the isoforms of the peripheral stalk
region of human V-ATPase with respect to their affinity and kinetics in different
combination. We found that different isoforms interacted in a similar manner with
the isoforms of other subunits. The differences in binding affinities among
isoforms were minor from our in vitro studies. However, such minor differences
from the binding interaction among isoforms might provide valuable information
for the future structural-functional studies of this holoenzyme.
