The production of lymphokines by T cells is dependent on TCR signalling and is
enhanced by costimulatory signals through CD28. In IL-2 producing T cells clones 
(Th1 cells), TCR signalling in the absence of costimulatory signals renders these
cells unable to product IL-2 in response to subsequent stimulation through the
TCR and CD28. Using a differential screening approach we independently cloned
murine lymphotactin from a cDNA library produced from an unresponsive Th1 cell.
Resting Th1 clones and freshly isolated CD8+ T cells produced lymphotactin mRNA
maximally in response to TCR stimulation alone and expression was surprisingly
inhibited by CD28 costimulation, at least early after activation. In addition,
Th1 cells made unresponsive by prior TCR stimulation, produced lymphotactin but
not IL-2 mRNA when restimulated through the TCR and CD28. Sequence analysis of
the lymphotactin gene and mapping of the transcription initiation sites have
delineated the promoter region and the boundaries of exons and introns. Studies
on post-translational modification of lymphotactin demonstrate the cleavage of
the signal peptide containing the first two cysteine residues in the predicted
amino acid sequence and suggests that the secreted lymphotactin is an
O-glycosylated protein.
