Low bone mass and an increased risk of fracture are predictors of osteoporosis.
Individuals who share the same bone-mineral density (BMD) vary in their fracture 
risk, suggesting that microstructural architecture is an important determinant of
skeletal strength. Here, we utilized the rich diversity of the Collaborative
Cross mice to identify putative causal genes that contribute to the risk of
fractures. Using microcomputed tomography, we examined key structural features
that pertain to bone quality in the femoral cortical and trabecular compartments 
of male and female mice. We estimated the broad-sense heritability to be 50-60%
for all examined traits, and we identified five quantitative trait loci (QTL)
significantly associated with six traits. We refined each QTL by combining
information inferred from the ancestry of the mice, ranging from RNA-Seq data and
published literature to shortlist candidate genes. We found strong evidence for
new candidate genes, particularly Rhbdf2, whose close association with the
trabecular bone volume fraction and number was strongly suggested by our
analyses. We confirmed our findings with mRNA expression assays of Rhbdf2 in
extreme-phenotype mice, and by phenotyping bones of Rhbdf2 knockout mice. Our
results indicate that Rhbdf2 plays a decisive role in bone mass accrual and
microarchitecture.
