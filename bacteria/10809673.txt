By virtue of its control over major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) 
gene expression, CIITA represents a key molecule in the regulation of adaptive
immune responses. It was first identified as a factor that is defective in MHC-II
deficiency, a hereditary disease characterized by the absence of MHC-II
expression. CIITA is a highly regulated transactivator that governs all spatial, 
temporal, and quantitative aspects of MHC-II expression. It has been proposed to 
act as a non-DNA-binding transcriptional coactivator, but evidence that it
actually functions at the level of MHC-II promoters was lacking. By means of
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show here for the first time that CIITA 
is physically associated with MHC-II, as well as HLA-DM, Ii, MHC-I, and beta(2)m 
promoters in vivo. To dissect the mechanism by which CIITA is recruited to the
promoter, we have developed a DNA-dependent coimmunoprecipitation assay and a
pull-down assay using immobilized promoter templates. We demonstrate that CIITA
recruitment depends on multiple, synergistic protein-protein interactions with
DNA-bound factors constituting the MHC-II enhanceosome. CIITA therefore
represents a paradigm for a novel type of regulatory and gene-specific
transcriptional cofactor.
