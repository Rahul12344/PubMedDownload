Zoliflodacin is a novel spiropyrimidinetrione with activity against bacterial
type II topoisomerases that inhibits DNA biosynthesis and results in accumulation
of double-strand cleavages in bacteria. We report results from two phase 1
studies that investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
zoliflodacin and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) after
single doses in healthy volunteers. In the single ascending dose study,
zoliflodacin was rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum concentration of drug
in serum (T max) between 1.5 and 2.3 h. Exposure increased dose proportionally up
to 800 mg and less than dose proportionally between 800 and 4,000 mg. Urinary
excretion of unchanged zoliflodacin was <5.0% of the total dose. In the fed
state, absorption was delayed (T max, 4 h), accompanied by an increase in the
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at 1,500- and 3,000-mg doses. In
the ADME study (3,000 mg orally), the PK profile of zoliflodacin had exposure
(AUC and maximum concentration of drug in serum [C max]) similar to that of the
ascending dose study and a median T max of 2.5 h. A total of 97.8% of the
administered radioactivity was recovered in excreta, with urine and fecal
elimination accounting for approximately 18.2% and 79.6% of the dose,
respectively. The major clearance pathway was via metabolism and elimination in
feces with low urinary recovery of unchanged drug (approximately 2.5%) and
metabolites accounting for 56% of the dose excreted in the feces. Zoliflodacin
represented 72.3% and metabolite M3 accounted for 16.4% of total circulating
radioactivity in human plasma. Along with the results from these studies and
based upon safety, PK, and PK/pharmacodynamics targets, a dosage regimen was
selected for evaluation in a phase 2 study in urogenital gonorrhea. (The studies 
discussed in this paper have been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under
identifiers NCT01929629 and NCT02298920.).
