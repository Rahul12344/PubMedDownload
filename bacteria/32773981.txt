Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare condition affecting the gingiva 
and may or may not be a clinical feature of other syndromes. It has been
classified as a nondental biofilm-induced gingival disease. The pathogenesis of
this condition has been poorly understood till date. Although different genetic
mutations have been implicated to play a role, there is considerable interest on 
an addition mutation of Son of Sevenless-1 (SOS-1) gene. We report a case of a
27-year-old male patient who came to us with the complaint of enlarged gums of
several years' duration. There were other members in his family who were
similarly affected. After the clinical diagnosis of HGF was confirmed, the
patient and his available family members were subjected to a genetic analysis for
identification of mutation in SOS-1 gene, which turned out to be negative. The
patient was treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy and is under regular
follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess SOS-1 
mutation in an Indian family.
