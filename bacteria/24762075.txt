NKT cells are a subpopulation of T lymphocytes with phenotypic properties of both
T and NK cells and a wide range of immune effector properties. In particular, one
subset of these cells, known as invariant NKT cells (iNKT cells), has attracted
substantial attention because of their ability to be specifically activated by
glycolipid antigens presented by a cell surface protein called CD1d. The
development of synthetic α-galactosylceramides as a family of powerful glycolipid
agonists for iNKT cells has led to approaches for augmenting a wide variety of
immune responses, including those involved in vaccination against infections and 
cancers. Here, we review basic, preclinical and clinical observations supporting 
approaches to improving immune responses through the use of iNKT cell-activating 
glycolipids. Results from preclinical animal studies and preliminary clinical
studies in humans identify many promising applications for this approach in the
development of vaccines and novel immunotherapies.
