The nine identified human homologues of E. coli AlkB 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and
Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase, ALKBH1-8 and FTO, display different substrate
specificities and diverse biological functions. Here we discovered the combined
overexpression of members of the ALKBH family in head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC). We found direct correlation of ALKBH3 and FTO expression with
primary HNSCC tumor size. We observed unidentified thus far cytoplasmic
localization of ALKBH2 and 5 in HNSCC, suggesting abnormal role(s) of ALKBH
proteins in cancer. Further, high expression of ALKBHs was observed not only in
HNSCC, but also in several cancerous cell lines and silencing ALKBH expression in
HeLa cancer cells resulted in dramatically decreased survival. Considering the
discovered impact of high expression of ALKBH proteins on HNSCC development, we
screened for ALKBH blockers among newly synthetized anthraquinone derivatives and
demonstrated their potential to support standard anticancer therapy.
