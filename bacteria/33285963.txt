The dynamics of cellular aggregates is driven by the interplay of mechanochemical
processes and cellular activity. Although deterministic models may capture
mechanical features, local chemical fluctuations trigger random cell responses,
which determine the overall evolution. Incorporating stochastic cellular behavior
in macroscopic models of biological media is a challenging task. Herein, we
propose hybrid models for bacterial biofilm growth, which couple a two phase
solid/fluid mixture description of mechanical and chemical fields with a dynamic 
energy budget-based cellular automata treatment of bacterial activity. Thin film 
and plate approximations for the relevant interfaces allow us to obtain numerical
solutions exhibiting behaviors observed in experiments, such as accelerated
spread due to water intake from the environment, wrinkle formation, undulated
contour development, and the appearance of inhomogeneous distributions of
differentiated bacteria performing varied tasks.
