Prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prFMN) is a recently discovered cofactor
required by the UbiD family of reversible decarboxylases involved in ubiquinone
biosynthesis, biological decomposition of lignin, and biotransformation of
aromatic compounds. This cofactor is synthesized by UbiX-like prenyltransferases 
catalyzing the transfer of the dimethylallyl moiety of
dimethylallyl-monophosphate (DMAP) to FMN. The origin of DMAP for prFMN
biosynthesis and the biochemical properties of free prFMN are unknown. We show
that in Escherichia coli cells, DMAP can be produced by phosphorylating prenol
using ThiM or dephosphorylating DMAPP using Nudix hydrolases. We produced
14 active prenyltransferases whose properties enabled the purification and
characterization of protein-free forms of prFMN. In vitro assays revealed that
the UbiD-like ferulate decarboxylase (Fdc1) can be activated by free prFMNiminium
or C2'-hydroxylated prFMNiminium under both oxidized and reduced conditions.
These insights into the biosynthesis and properties of prFMN will facilitate
further elucidation of the biochemical diversity of reversible UbiD
(de)carboxylases.
