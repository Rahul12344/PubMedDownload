BACKGROUND: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is involved in the
accumulation and activation of leukocytes in inflammatory sites through binding
to beta2 integrins expressed on leukocytes. We investigated whether or not
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the periodontopathic bacterium
Porphyromonas gingiualis affects ICAM-1 expression on human gingival fibroblasts 
(HGF). CD14 is a receptor for LPS on monocytes and macrophages and is also
present in serum as a soluble protein. We further examined the effects of serum
and soluble CD14 (sCD14) on ICAM-1 expression in HGF stimulated with P.
gingivalis LPS.
METHODS: HGF were prepared from explants of human gingival tissues and incubated 
in 96-well culture plates before LPS stimulation. LPS derived from Escherichia
coli O55:B5 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 LPS were employed. sCD14 was purified
from normal human serum (NHS) by affinity chromatography using an anti-CD14
monoclonal antibody. ICAM-1 expression on HGF was measured by a cell
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: P. gingivalis LPS induced ICAM-1 on HGF in a dose-dependent manner in
the presence of either 10% fetal calf serum or 2% NHS. The ability of P.
gingivalis LPS to induce ICAM-1 was comparable to that of LPS from E. coli at
high LPS concentrations. In the absence of NHS, ICAM-1 induction was negligible
in HGF stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, reaching a maximum at 2% NHS. The
ICAM-1 expression induced by P. gingivalis LPS was inhibited by a monoclonal
antibody to CD14. Supplementation of serum-free medium with sCD14 alone restored 
the capacity of HGF to respond to P. gingivalis LPS.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that P. gingivalis LPS induces ICAM-1
expression in HGF in an sCD14-dependent manner. The overexpression of ICAM-1 on
fibroblasts in gingiva induced by P. gingivalis LPS seems to be involved in the
retention of inflammatory cells in periodontitis lesions.
