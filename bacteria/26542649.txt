BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe clinical
characteristics of Salmonella bacteremia in adult patients and analyze
ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates.
METHODS: A total of 101 Salmonella blood isolates from adult patients were
collected from January 2011 to December 2013 in MacKay Memorial Hospital. Eight
ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible Salmonella blood isolates were screened for
carbapenemase and other β lactamase genes. Isolates were examined by PCR for the 
quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of all subunits for DNA gyrase
(gyrA and gyrB) genes and topoisomerase IV (parC and parE) genes.
RESULTS: There were 22 (21.78%) S. enterica serovar B, 5 (4.95%) S. enterica
serovar C1, 7 (6.93%) S. enterica serovar C2, 65 (64.36%) S. enterica serovar D, 
and 2 (1.98%) S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi) isolates. β-lactamase gene
screening and sequencing yielded only one blaCMY-2-positive isolate. In
multivariate risk factor analysis, renal insufficiency [odds ratio (OR) 3.774;
p = 0.020] and heart disease (OR 2.922; p = 0.027) were more common among elderly
patients (≥65 years). Independent risk factors for ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible
strains included S. enterica serovar C2 (OR 28.430; p = 0.032), renal
insufficiency (OR 13.927; p = 0.032), and immunosuppression agent usage (OR
60.082; p = 0.006). 87.50% (7/8) of isolates had gyrA mutation, 62.50% (5/8) had 
parC mutation, and none had gyrB and parE mutations. Isolates with both
Ser83Phe/Asp87Asn gyrA and Thr57Ser/Ser80Ile parC mutation genes were highly
ciprofloxacin-resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration ≥4 mg/L).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with renal insufficiency and heart disease were at 
risk for Salmonella bacteremia. Those for ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strains
included S. enterica serovar C2, renal insufficiency, and immunosuppression agent
usage. The 8 ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates carried gyrA and parC
mutations, which cause resistance that poses a major concern.
