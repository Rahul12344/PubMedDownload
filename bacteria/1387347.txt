A CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ T cell clone (A35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of
a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica.
This clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had
been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. There was no
restriction by polymorphic parts of HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules and a HLA class
II-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart,
whereas infected HLA class I-deficient cells (Daudi cells) were not. The clone
showed crossreaction between Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells
preincubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. MAb to CD2, CD3, and CD8
efficiently blocked A35, whereas the addition of mAb to HLA class II or to HLA
class I did not. This clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism
against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the
immunopathology of reactive arthritis.
