Diarrhea is a major cause of infantile morbidity and mortality in developing
countries. A community-based, case control study was conducted in a southern
Mexican Mayan village for 3 weeks during the peak diarrhea period to
prospectively identify the infectious agents associated with childhood diarrheal 
disease. Several enteropathogens were isolated from stools of 34 of 58 cases,
although none was significantly associated with diarrhea. For the 24 cases from
which no enteropathogens were isolated, diffuse-adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) 
strains were significantly associated with diarrheal disease (P less than .02;
odds ratio = 6; 95% confidence limit, 1.08-99.0). DAEC were highly heterogeneous 
with respect to plasmid content and serotype. Three DNA probes designed to
differentiate E. coli exhibiting localized, diffuse, or aggregative adherence
were compared with results from a standard HeLa cell binding assay to assess the 
utility of these probes in the field. This study provides evidence for the
potential pathogenic capacity of DAEC and underscores the variety of diarrheal
agents operating within a community.
