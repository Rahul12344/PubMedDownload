BALB/c mice were immunized with the recombinant Brucella abortus L7/L12 ribosomal
protein fused to maltose binding protein (MBP). Vaccinated animals mounted a
specific immune response to the recombinant fusion protein as demonstrated by
immunoblot analyses. Additionally, B. abortus L7/L12 ribosomal protein conferred 
a significant degree of protection when compared to mice vaccinated with adjuvant
alone, adjuvant plus MBP or B. abortus. These results indicate that a recombinant
B. abortus protein, previously identified as T-cell-reactive, engendered
protective immunity to mice against brucellosis.
