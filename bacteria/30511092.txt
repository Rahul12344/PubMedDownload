To fight infection, arthropods rely on the deployment of an innate immune
response but also upon physical/chemical barriers and avoidance behaviours.
However, most studies focus on immunity, with other defensive mechanisms being
relatively overlooked. We have previously shown that the spider mite Tetranychus 
urticae does not mount an induced immune response towards systemic bacterial
infections, entailing very high mortality rates. Therefore, we hypothesized that 
other defence mechanisms may be operating to minimize infection risk. Here, we
test (a) if spider mites are also highly susceptible to other infection
routes-spraying and feeding-and (b) if they display avoidance behaviours towards 
infected food. Individuals sprayed with or fed on Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas
putida survived less than the control, pointing to a deficient capacity of the
gut epithelium, and possibly of the cuticle, to contain bacteria. Additionally,
we found that spider mites prefer uninfected food to food contaminated with
bacteria, a choice that probably does not rely on olfactory cues. Our results
suggest that spider mites may rely mostly on avoidance behaviours to minimize
bacterial infection and highlight the multi-layered nature of immune strategies
present in arthropods.
