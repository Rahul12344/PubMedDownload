A major cause of yield loss in wheat worldwide is the fungal pathogen
Zymoseptoria tritici, a hemibiotrophic fungus which causes Septoria leaf blotch, 
the most destructive wheat disease in Europe. Resistance in commercial wheat
varieties is poor, however, a link between reduced nitrogen availability and
increased Septoria tolerance has been observed. We have shown that Septoria load 
is not affected by nitrogen, whilst the fungus is in its first, symptomless stage
of growth. This suggests that a link between nitrogen and Septoria is only
present during the necrotrophic phase of Septoria infection. Quantitative
real-time PCR data demonstrated that WRKYs, a superfamily of plant-specific
transcription factors, are differentially expressed in response to both reduced
nitrogen and Septoria. WRKY39 was downregulated over 30-fold in response to
necrotrophic stage Septoria, whilst changes in the expression of WRKY68a during
the late biotrophic phase were dependent on the concentration of nitrogen under
which wheat is grown. WRKY68a may therefore mediate a link between nitrogen and
Septoria. The potential remains to identify key regulators in the link between
nitrogen and Septoria, and as such, elucidate molecular markers for wheat
breeding, or targets for molecular-based breeding approaches.
