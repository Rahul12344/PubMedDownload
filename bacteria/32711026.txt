Neuroblastoma is the most commonly diagnosed extracranial solid tumor in
children. The patients with aggressive metastatic disease or refractory/relapsed 
neuroblastoma currently face a dismally low chance of survival. Thus, there is a 
great need for more effective therapies for this illness. In previous studies,
we, as well as others, showed that the immune cell chemoattractant C-C motif
chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) is effective as an intratumoral therapy able to slow 
the growth of cancers. In this current study, we developed and tested an
injectable, slow-release, uniform, and optimally loaded alginate nanoformulation 
of CCL21 as a means to provide prolonged intratumoral treatment. The
alginate-nanoformulated CCL21, when injected intratumorally into mice bearing
neuroblastoma lesions, significantly prolonged survival and decreased the tumor
growth rate compared to CCL21 alone, empty nanoparticles, or buffer. Notably, we 
also observed complete tumor clearance and subsequent full protection against
tumor rechallenge in 33% of nanoformulated CCL21-treated mice. Greater
intratumoral presence of nanoformulated CCL21, compared to free CCL21, at days 1 
and 2 after treatment ended was confirmed through fluorescent labeling and
tracking. Nanoformulated CCL21-treated tumors exhibited a general pattern of
prolonged increases in anti-tumor cytokines and relatively lower levels of
pro-tumor cytokines in comparison to tumors treated with CCL21 alone or buffer
only. Thus, this novel nanoformulation of CCL21 is an effective treatment for
neuroblastoma, and may have potential for the delivery of CCL21 to other types of
solid tumors in the future and as a slow-release delivery modality for other
immunotherapies.
