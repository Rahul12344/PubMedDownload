We used human tuberculosis as a model to investigate the role of NK cytotoxic
mechanisms in the immune response to intracellular infection. Freshly isolated NK
cells and NK cell lines from healthy donors lysed Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-infected monocytes to a greater extent than uninfected monocytes.
Lysis of infected monocytes was associated with increased expression of mRNA for 
the NKp46 receptor, but not the NKp44 receptor. Antisera to NKp46 markedly
inhibited lysis of infected monocytes. NK cell-mediated lysis was not due to
reduced expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of infected monocytes 
or to enhanced production of IL-18 or IFN-gamma. NK cell lytic activity against
M. tuberculosis-infected monocytes and NKp46 mRNA expression were reduced in
tuberculosis patients with ineffective immunity to M. tuberculosis compared with 
findings in healthy donors. These observations suggest that 1) the NKp46 receptor
participates in NK cell-mediated lysis of cells infected with an intracellular
pathogen, and 2) the reduced functional capacity of NK cells is associated with
severe manifestations of infectious disease.
