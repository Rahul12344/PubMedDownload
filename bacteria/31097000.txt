BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is initiated and maintained by a unique,
small subset of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). LSCs are characterized by
unrestricted self-renewal and contribute to the malignancy of leukemia. Aberrant 
protein fucosylation is associated with AML progression. However, it is still
less understood that the miR-29b/Sp1/FUT4 crosstalk involved in the
fucosylation-mediated LSCs malignancy in AML.
METHODS: AML cell lines were sorted by magnetic microbeads to obtain the
CD34 + CD38- sub-population. The key biomarkers for LSCs were identified by flow 
cytometry. Fucosyltransferase genes were screened by qRT-PCR, and FUT4 was
focused. Effect of FUT4 on LSCs malignancy was determined by CCK8 assay, sphere
formation assay, immunofluorescence staining, apoptosis and in vivo xenografts
experiments. The linkage of FUT4 promoter and Sp1 was confirmed by
dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. ChIP-PCR assay was used to show the directly
binding of Sp1 and FUT4 promoter. Activity of Wnt//β-catenin pathway was
determined by western blot. Overall survival curves were diagrammed by
Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Here, the expressional profiles of 11 fucosyltransferase genes were
different comparing LSCs and non-LSCs of KG-1a and MOLM13 cells, whereas
CD34 + CD38- cells exhibited higher expression of FUT4. Functionally, alteration 
of FUT4 in CD34 + CD38- cells modulated LSCs malignant behaviors both in vitro
and in vivo. Transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Act D) or translational
inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) prevented LSCs progression, and Sp1 was identified 
as the efficient regulator of FUT4 transcription. Moreover, miR-29b directly
affected the binding of Sp1 and FUT4 promoter region, which further mediated LSCs
proliferation, apoptosis and drug-resistance through fucosylated-CD44 via
activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Clinically, Sp1 and FUT4 were up-regulated
and positively correlated with poor overall survival of AML patients.
CONCLUSION: These data indicated that miR-29b/Sp1/FUT4 axis promoted the
malignant behaviors of LSCs by regulating fucosylated CD44 via Wnt/β-catenin
pathway. Identifying LSCs surface markers and targeting LSCs were important for
the development of potential therapies in AML.
