T cells that are gene-modified with tumor-specific T cell receptors are a
promising treatment for metastatic melanoma patients. In a clinical trial, we
treated seven metastatic melanoma patients with autologous T cells transduced to 
express a tyrosinase-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) (TIL 1383I) and a truncated
CD34 molecule as a selection marker. We followed transgene expression in the
TCR-transduced T cells after infusion and observed that both lentiviral- and
retroviral-transduced T cells lost transgene expression over time, so that by
4 weeks post-transfer, few T cells expressed either lentiviral or retroviral
transgenes. Transgene expression was reactivated by stimulation with
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads and cytokines. TCR-transduced T cell lentiviral and
retroviral transgene expression was also downregulated in vitro when T cells were
cultured without cytokines. Transduced T cells cultured with interleukin (IL)-15 
maintained transgene expression. Culturing gene-modified T cells in the presence 
of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors maintained transgene expression and
functional TCR-transduced T cell responses to tumor. These results implicate
epigenetic processes in the loss of transgene expression in lentiviral- and
retroviral-transduced T cells.
