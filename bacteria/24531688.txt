The rough coat (rc) spontaneous mutation causes sebaceous gland (SG) hypertrophy,
hair loss, and extracutaneous abnormalities including growth retardation. The rc 
mice have a missense mutation in the predicted Ig protein Myelin Protein
Zero-Like 3 (Mpzl3). In this study, we generated Mpzl3 knockout mice to determine
its functions in the skin. Homozygous Mpzl3 knockout mice showed unkempt and
greasy hair coat and hair loss soon after birth. Histological analysis revealed
severe SG hypertrophy and increased dermal thickness, but did not detect
significant changes in the hair cycle. Mpzl3-null mice frequently developed
inflammatory skin lesions; however, the early-onset skin abnormalities were not
the result of immune defects. The abnormalities in the Mpzl3 knockout mice
closely resemble those observed in rc/rc mice, and in mice heterozygous for both 
the rc and Mpzl3 knockout alleles, indicating that rc and Mpzl3 are allelic.
Using a lacZ reporter gene, we detected Mpzl3 promoter activity in the companion 
layer and inner root sheath of the hair follicle, SG, and epidermis. Loss of
MPZL3 function also caused a striking reduction in cutaneous and overall adipose 
tissue. These data reveal a complex role for Mpzl3 in the control of skin
development, hair growth, and adipose cell functions.
