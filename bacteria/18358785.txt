CD8(+) T cells play an important role in the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D)
in NOD mice and humans. IGRP (islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic
subunit-related protein) has emerged in recent years as a major antigen in NOD
mice. Therefore, we aimed to determine if IGRP is an antigen in T1D patients and 
to identify the HLA-A2-restricted IGRP epitopes targeted. Using IFN-gamma ELISPOT
assay, we tested PBMC from recent-onset pediatric T1D patients and healthy
controls for reactivity to four IGRP peptides directly ex vivo. Importantly, 65% 
of patients and 0% of controls were positive for at least one IGRP peptide. Two
of these have not been reported previously. These data provide evidence that IGRP
is a CD8(+) T cell antigen in humans, contributing to the understanding of the
underlying disease process as well as to future directions for diagnosis and
monitoring disease progression in T1D patients.
