We report, the surface presentation of organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) and green
fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions by employing the
adhesin-involved-in-diffuse-adherence (AIDA-I) translocator domain as a
transporter and anchoring motif. The surface location of the OPH-GFP fusion
protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and protease
accessibility, followed by Western blotting analysis. The investigation of growth
kinetics and stability of resting cultures showed that the presence of the AIDA-I
translocator domain in the outer membrane neither inhibits cell growth nor
affects cell viability. Furthermore, the surface-exposed OPH-GFP was shown to
have enzymatic activity and a functional fluorescence moiety. These results
suggest that AIDA-I autotransporter is a useful tool to present heterologous
macromolecule passenger proteins on the bacterial surface. Our strategy of
linking GFP to OPH and the possibility to employ various bacterial species as
host has enormous potential for enhancing field use.
