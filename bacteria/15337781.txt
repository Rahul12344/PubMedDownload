Listeria monocytogenes uptake by nonphagocytic cells is promoted by the bacterial
invasion proteins internalin and InlB, which bind to their host receptors
E-cadherin and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF-R)/Met, respectively. Here,
we present evidence that plasma membrane organization in lipid domains is
critical for Listeria uptake. Cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
reversibly inhibited Listeria entry. Lipid raft markers, such as
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, a myristoylated and palmitoylated
peptide and the ganglioside GM1 were recruited at the bacterial entry site. We
analyzed which molecular events require membrane cholesterol and found that the
presence of E-cadherin in lipid domains was necessary for initial interaction
with internalin to promote bacterial entry. In contrast, the initial interaction 
of InlB with HGF-R did not require membrane cholesterol, whereas downstream
signaling leading to F-actin polymerization was cholesterol dependent. Our work, 
in addition to documenting for the first time the role of lipid rafts in Listeria
entry, provides the first evidence that E-cadherin and HGF-R require lipid domain
integrity for their full activity.
