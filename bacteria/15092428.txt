This paper deals with the interactions of different physico-chemical parameters
in the water profile, and the bioconcentration of zinc and lead in Husainsagar
Lake, India. The concentrations of both the metals are within the permissible
limits (Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India (1975). Manual of
Standards of Quality for Drinking Water Supplies. ICMR Special Report, p. 44).
The concentration of Zn and Pb in the vertical profile were highest in the bottom
stratum of the lake and least in the surface stratum. Their concentrations were
two to three thousand-fold more in surficial sediments than in the overlying
water column. The concentration of Zn increased with increasing trophic level
from nanoplankton to zooplankton, but not to fish, and the concentration of Pb
decreased with increasing trophic level: nanoplankton --> phytoplankton -->
zooplankton --> fish, illustrating no bioconcentration of metals in the classic
sense of the term as has been noted for mercury and chlorinated hydrocarbons
(DDT).
