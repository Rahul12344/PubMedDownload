Human exposure to nanoparticles (NPs) is inevitable as NPs become more widely
applied and, as a result, nanotoxicology study is now gaining attention. Herein, 
the interaction of zero valent iron NPs (ZVFe-NPs) with human hemoglobin (Hb) was
evaluated using a variety of techniques including fluorescence spectroscopy, far 
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy as well as docking study. Also, the
cytotoxicity of ZVFe-NPs on the human lymphocyte cell line as a model of blood
system cell line was investigated by 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), acridine
orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR
assays. Fluorescence studies revealed that ZVFe-NPs bind to Hb via hydrogen bonds
and induced conformational changes of Hb in a static denaturation mechanism. CD
experiment showed that Hb retained its native structure in the presence of
ZVFe-NP. Molecular docking study also demonstrated that polar residues of Hb
provide convenient medium to establish hydrogen bonds with water molecules on
ZVFe-NP surface. Likewise, it was also revealed that ZVFe-NPs impaired the
viability of lymphocyte cells through apoptotic pathway. For NPs to move into the
clinical area, it is crucial that nanotoxicology research provide pivotal
information about the adverse effect of NPs against biological systems.
