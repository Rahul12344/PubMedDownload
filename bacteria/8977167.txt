HLA-DM- APC are unable to present soluble Ags to T cells in the context of class 
II DR molecules. This defect in DM- APC can be overcome by receptor-mediated
delivery of Ag into cells. Ag conjugated to ligands for cell surface receptors,
such as transferrin or goat anti-human Ig, was processed and presented by DM-
T2.DR4 cells. Intracellular processing of Ag conjugates was required, as receptor
cross-linking alone did not restore presentation by DM- APC. Ag conjugates
targeted by transferrin receptors to endosomes or via surface Ig to endosomal and
lysosomal compartments, were each efficiently presented by DM- cells. These Ag
conjugates were predominantly localized in light density endosomes in T2.DR4
cells. This study demonstrates that the facilitated uptake and sorting of
exogenous Ag by cell surface receptors allow efficient class II-restricted
presentation even in the absence of HLA-DM.
