Identification of new genes in a cell envelope-cell division gene cluster of
Escherichia coli: cell envelope gene murG.

Salmond GP, Lutkenhaus JF, Donachie WD.

We report the identification, cloning, and mapping of a new cell envelope gene,
murG. This lies in a group of five genes of similar phenotype (in the order murE 
murF murG murC ddl) all concerned with peptidoglycan biosynthesis. This group is 
in a larger cluster of at least 10 genes, all of which are involved in some way
with cell envelope growth.
