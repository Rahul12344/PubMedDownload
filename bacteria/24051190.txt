Infectious micro-organisms may be transmitted by a variety of routes, and some
may be spread by more than one route. Respiratory and facial protection is
required for those organisms that are usually transmitted via the
droplet/airborne route, or when airborne particles have been artificially
created, such as during 'aerosol-generating procedures'. A range of personal
protective equipment that provides different degrees of facial and respiratory
protection is available. It is apparent from the recent experiences with severe
acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza that healthcare
workers may have difficulty in choosing the correct type of facial and
respiratory protection in any given clinical situation. To address this issue,
the Scientific Development Committee of the Healthcare Infection Society
established a short-life working group to develop guidance. The guidance is based
upon a review of the literature, which is published separately, and expert
consensus.
