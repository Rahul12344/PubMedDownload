Myo-inositol dehydrogenase(s) from Acetomonas oxydans.

Criddle WJ, Fry JC, Keaney MM, Lucas CM, Tovey JA.

Experimental studies have been undertaken with a view of isolation of the
enzyme(s) responsible for the stereospecific oxidation of myo-inositol. A partial
fractionation has been achieved and the properties of this extract examined.
Results show that the active enzyme may well have a cytochrome component and
there is indication that the stereospecificity of Acetomonas oxydans results from
permease as opposed to dehydrogenase activity. Kinetic experiments suggest that
only one type of active enzyme site is involved in the dehydrogenation of
myo-inositol.
