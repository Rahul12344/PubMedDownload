T cell receptor engagement and the B7-CD28 / CTLA-4 signaling pathways play
critical roles in T cell activation and regulation. CD28 engagement results in T 
cell activation, differentiation and survival while CTLA-4 signals block IL-2
production, cell cycle progression and T cell differentiation. We explored the
role of CTLA-4 in peripheral tolerance induced by intravenous administration of
ethylene carbodiimide-fixed, antigen-coupled splenocytes in the PLP139 -
151-induced relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis system. Tolerance
induction with PLP139 - 151-coupled splenocytes correlates with low B7 expression
on the fixed antigen-presenting cells, conditions that would favor
CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. Administration of CTLA-4Ig or anti-CTLA-4 concomitant
with the 'tolerogenic' stimulus, however, failed to reverse tolerance induction. 
In contrast, blocking CTLA-4 at the time of secondary 'immunogenic' encounter
with antigen reversed the tolerant state. These findings indicate that CTLA-4 is 
required to maintain the unresponsive state of the tolerized T cells upon
antigenic stimulation under inflammatory conditions and, therefore, have
important implications for therapeutic regulation of autoimmune disease.
