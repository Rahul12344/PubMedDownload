Ribosomes tightly interact with protein-conducting channels in the plasma
membrane of bacteria (SecYEG) and in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes
(Sec61 complex). This interaction is mediated by multiple junctions and is highly
conserved during evolution. Although it is well known that both ribosomal
proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are involved in the ribosome-channel
interaction, detailed analyses on how these components contribute to this binding
are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that the evolutionary conservation of ribosome 
binding is solely mediated by rRNA. Moreover, we show that in vitro transcribed
23 S rRNA binds with similar characteristics to protein translocation channels as
native 23 S rRNA or 50 S ribosomal subunits. This indicates that base
modifications, which exist in native rRNA, do not crucially influence the
binding. In two of the ribosome-channel junctions (c1 and c2), exclusively rRNA
helices are involved. Using in vitro transcribed rRNA mutants, we now provide
evidence that large parts of the rRNA can be deleted without altering its binding
properties, as long as the rRNA helices of the c1 and c2 junctions remain intact.
We demonstrate that the connection sites c1 and c2 generate high-affinity binding
sites that act independently of each other. This could explain why membrane-bound
ribosomes have an extremely low off-rate.
