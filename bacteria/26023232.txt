Members of the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 protein family mediate membrane protein insertion, 
and this process is initiated by the assembly of YidC·ribosome nascent chain
complexes at the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The positively charged C
terminus of Escherichia coli YidC plays a significant role in ribosome binding
but is not the sole determinant because deletion does not completely abrogate
ribosome binding. The positively charged cytosolic loops C1 and C2 of YidC may
provide additional docking sites. We performed systematic sequential deletions
within these cytosolic domains and studied their effect on the YidC insertase
activity and interaction with translation-stalled (programmed) ribosome.
Deletions within loop C1 strongly affected the activity of YidC in vivo but did
not influence ribosome binding or substrate insertion, whereas loop C2 appeared
to be involved in ribosome binding. Combining the latter deletion with the
removal of the C terminus of YidC abolished YidC-mediated insertion. We propose
that these two regions play an crucial role in the formation and stabilization of
an active YidC·ribosome nascent chain complex, allowing for co-translational
membrane insertion, whereas loop C1 may be involved in the downstream chaperone
activity of YidC or in other protein-protein interactions.
