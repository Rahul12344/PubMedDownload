Objective. To define otomycosis and determine the predisposing factors and
microbiology in primary otomycosis. Study Design. Prospective study of two years 
and review of the literature. Setting. Academic Department of Otolaryngology in a
coastal city in India. Patients. 150 immunocompetent individuals of whom 100
consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis are considered as
the study group and 50 consecutive patients with no otomycosis are considered as 
the control group. Results and Observations. Instillation of coconut oil (42%),
use of topical antibiotic eardrops (20%), and compulsive cleaning of external ear
with hard objects (32%) appeared to be the main predisposing factors in
otomycosis. Aspergilli were the most common isolates (80%) followed by
Penicillium (8%), Candida albicans (4%), Rhizopus (1%), and Chrysosporium (1%),
the last being reported for the first time in otomycosis. Among aspergilli, A.
niger complex (38%) was the most common followed by A. fumigatus complex (27%)
and A. flavus complex (15%). Bacterial isolates associated with fungi in
otomycosis were S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Proteus spp. In 42% of healthy
external ears fungi were isolated. Conclusion. Aspergillus spp. were the most
common fungi isolated, followed by Penicillium. Otomycotic ears are often
associated with bacterial isolates when compared to normal ears. Fungi are also
present in a significant number of healthy external auditory canals and their
profiles match those in cases of otomycosis. The use of terms "primary" and
"secondary" otomycosis is important to standardize reporting.
