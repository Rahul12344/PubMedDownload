European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) production is often hampered by bacterial
infections such as photobacteriosis caused by Photobacterium damselae subsp.
piscicida (Phdp). Since diet can impact fish immunity, this work investigated the
effect of dietary supplementation of 5% Gracilaria sp. aqueous extract (GRA) on
seabass antioxidant capacity and resistance against Phdp. After infection,
mortality was delayed in fish fed GRA, which also revealed increased lysozyme
activity levels, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation, suggesting higher
antioxidant capacity than in fish fed a control diet. Dietary GRA induced a
down-regulation of hepatic stress-responsive heat shock proteins (grp-78,
grp-170, grp-94, grp-75), while bacterial infection caused a down-regulation in
antioxidant genes (prdx4 and mn-sod). Diet and infection interaction
down-regulated the transcription levels of genes associated with oxidative stress
response (prdx5 and gpx4) in liver. In head-kidney, GRA led to an up-regulation
of genes associated with inflammation (il34, ccr9, cd33) and a down-regulation of
genes related to cytokine signalling (mif, il1b, defb, a2m, myd88). Additionally,
bacterial infection up-regulated immunoglobulins production (IgMs) and
down-regulated the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide leap2 in head
kidney. Overall, we found that GRA supplementation modulated seabass resistance
to Phdp infection.
