In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of human β-defensin-1
(hBD-1), human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) and human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) against three 
internationally common probiotic strains of lactic acid bacterium. Our results
indicated that hBD-1, hBD-2 and hBD-3 at the range of 0.08-10 μg/mL do not have
obvious antimicrobial activity against these strains. Viability of
Bifidobacterium longum JDM301 (B. longum JDM301), Bifidobacterium lactis HN019
(B. lactis HN019) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) were still very high even 
at concentration of 10 μg hBD/mL. Then, we explored the mechanism of resistance
by using carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to inhibit efflux pumps.
In the presence of CCCP, hBD-1, hBD-2 and hBD-3 exhibited enhanced antibacterial 
effect against B. longum JDM301 and B. lactis HN019, but not against LGG. Efflux 
pumps in B. longum JDM301 and B. lactis HN019 may partly contribute to their
resistance to hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3.
