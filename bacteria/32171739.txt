Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in the host defense against 
various microbes. One of the most efficient human AMPs is the human beta
defensin-3 (hBD-3) which is produced by, e.g. keratinocytes and lung epithelial
cells. However, the structure-function relationship for AMPs and in particular
for defensins with their typical three disulfide bonds is still poorly
understood. In this study the importance of the three disulfide bonds for the
activity of the AMPs is investigated with biological assays and with biophysical 
experiments utilizing different membrane reconstitution systems. The activities
of natural hBD-3, hBD-3-c (cyclic variant with one disulfide bond), and hBD-3-l
(linear variant without disulfide bonds) and fragments thereof were tested
against specific Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, hemolytic and cytotoxic
activities were analyzed as well as the potency to neutralize immune cell
stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Experiments using reconstituted lipid
matrices composed of phospholipids or LPS purified from the respective
Gram-negative bacteria, showed that the membrane activity of all three hBD-3
peptides is decisive for their capability to kill bacteria and to neutralize LPS.
In most of the test systems the linear hBD-3-l showed the highest activity. It
was also the only peptide significantly active against polymyxin B-resistant
Proteus mirabilis R45. However, the stability of hBD-3 against protease activity 
decreases with decreasing number of disulfide bonds. This study demonstrates that
the refining of AMP structures can generate more active compounds against certain
strains.
