The special features of cold-adapted lipolytic biocatalysts have made their use
possible in several industrial applications. In fact, cold-active enzymes are
known to be able to catalyze reactions at low temperatures, avoiding side
reactions taking place at higher temperatures and preserving the integrity of
products. A lipolytic gene was isolated from the Arctic marine bacterium
Rhodococcus sp. AW25M09 and expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies.
The recombinant enzyme (hereafter called RhLip) showed interesting cold-active
esterase activity. The refolded purified enzyme displayed optimal activity at 30 
°C and was cold-active with retention of 50% activity at 10 °C. It is worth
noting that the optimal pH was 11, and the low relative activity below pH 10
revealed that RhLip was an alkaliphilic esterase. The enzyme was active toward
short-chain p-nitrophenyl esters (C2-C6), displaying optimal activity with the
butyrate (C4) ester. In addition, the enzyme revealed a good organic solvent and 
salt tolerance. These features make this an interesting enzyme for exploitation
in some industrial applications.
