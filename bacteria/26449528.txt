Forced expression of defined transcriptional factors has been well documented as 
an effective method for cellular reprogramming or directed differentiation.
However, transgene expression is not amenable for therapeutic application due to 
potential insertional mutagenesis. Here, we have developed a bacterial type III
secretion system (T3SS)-based protein delivery tool and shown its application in 
directing pluripotent stem cell differentiation by a controlled delivery of
transcription factors relevant to early heart development. By fusing to an
N-terminal secretion sequence for T3SS-dependent injection, three transcriptional
factors, namely Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (abbreviated as GMT), were translocated
into murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where the proteins are effectively
targeted to the nucleus with an average intracellular half-life of 5.5â€‰hours.
Exogenous GMT protein injection activated the cardiac program, and multiple
rounds of GMT protein delivery significantly improved the efficiency of ESC
differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Combination of T3SS-mediated GMT delivery
and Activin A treatment showed an additive effect, resulting in on average 60% of
the ESCs differentiated into cardiomyocytes. ESC derived cardiomyocytes displayed
spontaneous rhythmic contractile movement as well as normal hormonal responses.
This work serves as a foundation for the bacterial delivery of multiple
transcription factors to direct cell fate without jeopardizing genomic integrity.
