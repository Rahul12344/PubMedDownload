BACKGROUND: Neutrophils have a short live in circulation and accelerate greatly
local immune responses via increased granulopoiesis and migration at high numbers
to infected or inflamed tissue.
HYPOTHESIS: Since neutrophils produce a variety of factors with destructive and
pro-inflammatory potential the regulation of their homeostasis and functions
might be eventually beneficial in inflammation-related pathological conditions.
Herein we investigated the effect of natural-derived verbascoside (Verb) and its 
positional isomer isoverbascoside (IsoVerb) on neutrophil functions.
METHODS: We used purified murine bone marrow (BM) neutrophils to study cell
responsiveness to priming or activation via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4.
The expression of CD11b, chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2), the
intracellular level of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in neutrophils were determined by flow
cytometry while the release of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in culture
supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: We found that Verb appeared less powerful inhibitor of TLR2 and
TLR4-mediated apoptosis than IsoVerb. However at concentrations below 16 µM and
in LPS priming conditions Verb was more selective inhibitor of CD11b and CXCR2
expression than IsoVerb. Both compounds showed similar activity on
integrin/chemokine receptor expression when neutrophils were stimulated with ZY
or were activated with LPS. Verb sustained CXCR2 expression and turnover via
regulation of the cell responsiveness to its ligand KC (CXCL1) and via the
release of MIP-2 (CXCL2). Both Verb and IsoVerb increased TNF-α production and
inhibited p38 phosphorylation in TNF-α+ cells. We fail to discriminate sharply
between Verb's and IsoVerb's efficacy when studying p38 phosphorylation in LPS
stimulated neutrophils. The multi-parametric analysis provides critical insight
on the range of on-target effects of Verb and IsoVerb.
CONCLUSION: The strength and selectivity of Verb and IsoVerb depended on the
degree of activation and functional state of neutrophils, and both compounds are 
with potential to affect neutrophil-related pathologies/conditions in heterogenic
populations.
