The activation of naive CD4+ T cells requires both TCR engagement and a second
costimulatory signal mediated by the interaction of CD28 with CD80/CD86 expressed
on professional APC. However, the situation for naive CD8+ T cells is less clear.
Although evidence indicates that induction of CD8+ T cell responses is also
dependent on professional APC, the ability of some tumors, which do not express
CD80/CD86, to induce CTL suggests that other pathways of costimulation exist for 
the activation of CD8+ T cells. We examined the ability of tumor cells expressing
different levels of a tumor-specific Ag to directly prime CD8+ T cells. We
demonstrate that CD8+ T cells are directly activated by tumor cells in a
CD80/CD86-CD28 independent manner. In this system, costimulation requires
ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. This results in the generation of CTL capable of
inhibiting tumor growth in vivo, and maintaining long-term survival.
