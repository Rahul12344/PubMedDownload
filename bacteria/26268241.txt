Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a common subtype of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with a poor prognosis. We performed targeted resequencing 
on 92 cases of PTCL and identified frequent mutations affecting RHOA, TET2,
DNMT3A, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). Although IDH2 mutations are
largely confined to AITL, mutations of the other 3 can be found in other types of
PTCL, although at lower frequencies. These findings indicate a key role of
epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of AITL. However, the epigenetic
alterations induced by these mutations and their role in AITL pathogenesis are
still largely unknown. We correlated mutational status with gene expression and
global DNA methylation changes in AITL. Strikingly, AITL cases with IDH2(R172)
mutations demonstrated a distinct gene expression signature characterized by
downregulation of genes associated with TH1 differentiation (eg, STAT1 and IFNG) 
and a striking enrichment of an interleukin 12-induced gene signature. Ectopic
expression of IDH2(R172K) in the Jurkat cell line and CD4(+) T cells led to
markedly increased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate, histone-3 lysine methylation,
and 5-methylcytosine and a decrease of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Correspondingly, 
clinical samples with IDH2 mutations displayed a prominent increase in H3K27me3
and DNA hypermethylation of gene promoters. Integrative analysis of gene
expression and promoter methylation revealed recurrently hypermethylated genes
involved in T-cell receptor signaling and T-cell differentiation that likely
contribute to lymphomagenesis in AITL.
