Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an effective anti-fibrotic factor because of
its bioactivity in inhibiting fibrosis-related proteins in the development of
hepatic fibrosis. However, high-level production of bioactive mature form HGF is 
difficult because of its complex structure. Here, we report a non-fusion protein 
expression system to obtain truncated variant of N-terminal hairpin and first
kringle domains of HGF (tvNK1) in Escherichia coli to determine its anti-fibrotic
effects on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Under the selected conditions of
cultivation and isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction, the expression
level of tvNK1 accounted for approximately 65 % of the total cellular protein and
50 % of fusion protein in the supernatant of whole cell lysates. The recombinant 
protein could be purified in one step with Ni(2+)-affinity chromatograph.
Finally, about 65 mg recombinant tvNK1 was obtained from 1 l fermentation culture
with no <95 % purity. In vitro, the final purified tvNK1 was shown to inhibit the
proliferation of HSCs and decrease the mRNA and protein expression levels of
fibrosis-related COL1A1 and α-smooth muscle actin genes.
