Inhalation exposure to indoor air pollutants and cigarette smoke increases the
risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). Whether exposure to ambient air pollution
particulate matter (PM) alters protective human host immune responses against
Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been little studied. Here, we examined the effect 
of PM from Iztapalapa, a municipality of Mexico City, with aerodynamic diameters 
below 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10) on innate antimycobacterial immune
responses in human alveolar type II epithelial cells of the A549 cell line.
Exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 deregulated the ability of the A549 cells to express
the antimicrobial peptides human β-defensin 2 (HBD-2) and HBD-3 upon infection
with M. tuberculosis and increased intracellular M. tuberculosis growth (as
measured by CFU count). The observed modulation of antibacterial responsiveness
by PM exposure was associated with the induction of senescence in PM-exposed A549
cells and was unrelated to PM-mediated loss of cell viability. Thus, the
induction of senescence and downregulation of HBD-2 and HBD-3 expression in
respiratory PM-exposed epithelial cells leading to enhanced M. tuberculosis
growth represent mechanisms by which exposure to air pollution PM may increase
the risk of M. tuberculosis infection and the development of TB.
