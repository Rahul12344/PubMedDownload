The natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp30 (CD337) is a key player for NK cell
immunosurveillance of infections and cancer. The molecular details of ligand
recognition and its connection to CD3ζ signaling remain unsolved. Here, we show
that the stalk domain (129KEHPQLGAGTVLLLR143) of NKp30 is very sensitive to
sequence alterations, as mutations lead to impaired ligand binding and/or
signaling capacity. Surprisingly, the stalk domains of NKp30 and NKp46, another
NCR employing CD3ζ for signaling, were not exchangeable without drastic
deficiencies in folding, plasma membrane targeting, and/or ligand-induced
receptor signaling. Further mutational studies, N-glycosylation mapping, and
plasma membrane targeting studies in the absence and presence of CD3ζ suggest two
interconvertible types of NCR-CD3ζ assemblies: 1) a signaling incompetent
structural NKp30-CD3ζ complex and 2) a ligand-induced signaling competent
NKp30-CD3ζ complex. Moreover, we propose that ligand binding triggers
translocation of Arg-143 from the membrane interface into the membrane to enable 
alignment with oppositely charged aspartate residues within CD3ζ and activation
of CD3ζ-signaling.
