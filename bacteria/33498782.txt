Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy type 2 (CGL2) is the most severe form of
lipodystrophy and is caused by mutations in the BSCL2 gene. Affected patients
exhibit a near complete lack of adipose tissue and suffer severe metabolic
disease. A recent study identified infection as a major cause of death in CGL2
patients, leading us to examine whether Bscl2 loss could directly affect the
innate immune response. We generated a novel mouse model selectively lacking
Bscl2 in the myeloid lineage (LysM-B2KO) and also examined the function of
bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) isolated from global Bscl2 knockout (SKO) 
mice. LysM-B2KO mice failed to develop lipodystrophy and metabolic disease,
providing a model to study the direct role of Bscl2 in myeloid lineage cells.
Lipopolysaccharide-mediated stimulation of inflammatory cytokines was not
impaired in LysM-B2KO mice or in BMDM isolated from either LysM-B2KO or SKO mice.
Additionally, intracellular fate and clearance of bacteria in SKO BMDM challenged
with Staphylococcus aureus was indistinguishable from that in BMDM isolated from 
littermate controls. Overall, our findings reveal that selective Bscl2 deficiency
in macrophages does not critically impact the innate immune response to
infection. Instead, an increased susceptibility to infection in CGL2 patients is 
likely to result from severe metabolic disease.
