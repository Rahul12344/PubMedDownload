The aim of this study was to construct a bifunctional fusion protein consisting
of staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) and enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP). We inserted EGFP and SEC2 fragments into the pET-28a(+) vector to create 
the expression plasmid vector, pET-28a(+)-SEC2-EGFP, using a two-step method.
After verification of the plasmid, successful isolation of the fusion protein,
SEC2-EGFP, was achieved by Ni+-affinity chromatography. Fluorescence microscopy, 
methylthiazol tetrazolium, and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that the
constructed fusion protein not only retained the fluorescence signal of EGFP but 
also exhibited SEC2 bioactivity. Therefore, SEC2-EGFP is a promising tool for the
study of the detailed temporal and spatial distributions of SEC2 in cells. Future
studies with this vector may help uncover novel therapeutic strategies to treat
or manage SEC2-associated diseases and be a new clinical tool for exploiting SEC2
in immunotherapy.
