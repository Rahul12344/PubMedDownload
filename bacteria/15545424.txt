In a screening campaign to isolate strains with the ability to remove the bad
smell associated with animal faeces, strain MA001(T) was isolated from a soil
sample obtained from Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The isolate grew at pH 6-9 but
not at pH 10. Cells were Gram-positive, straight rods with peritrichous flagella 
and produced ellipsoidal spores. The isolate was positive for catalase and
oxidase tests but negative for indole production, deamination of phenylalanine
and H(2)S production. The isolate did not produce acid from any carbohydrates
tested and could not grow in more than 2 % NaCl. The DNA G+C content was 39.4
mol%. The cellular fatty acids profile consisted of significant amount of C(15)
branched-chain fatty acids, iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(15 : 0). Phylogenetic
analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that strain MA001(T) was
closely related to Bacillus simplex and Bacillus psychrosaccharolyticus. DNA-DNA 
hybridization revealed a low relatedness of the isolate to several
phylogenetically close neighbours (less than 9 %). On the basis of the phenotypic
characteristics observed, phylogenetic data based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and
DNA-DNA relatedness data, it is concluded that the isolate should be classified
as representing a novel species, for which the name Bacillus asahii is proposed. 
The type strain is MA001(T) (=JCM 12112(T)=NCIMB 13969(T)).
