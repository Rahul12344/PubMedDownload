Borrelia burgdorferi evades complement-mediated killing by interacting with
complement regulators through distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface
proteins (CRASPs). Here, we extend our analyses to the contribution of CRASP-4 in
mediating complement resistance of B. burgdorferi and its interaction with human 
complement regulators. CRASP-4 (also known as ErpC) was immobilized onto magnetic
beads and used to capture proteins from human serum. Following Western blotting, 
factor H (CFH), CFH-related protein 1 (CFHR1), CFHR2, and CFHR5 were identified
as ligands of CRASP-4. To analyze the impact of native CRASP-4 on mediating
survival of serum-sensitive cells in human serum, a B. garinii strain was
generated that ectopically expresses CRASP-4. CRASP-4-producing bacteria bound
CFHR1, CFHR2, and CFHR5 but not CFH. In addition, transformed spirochetes
deposited significant amounts of lethal complement components on their surface
and were susceptible to human serum, thus indicating that CRASP-4 plays a
subordinate role in complement resistance of B. burgdorferi.
