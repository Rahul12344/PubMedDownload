BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus can cause life-threatening infections. Human
susceptibility to S. aureus infection may be influenced by host genetic
variation.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a large health plan-based
cohort included biologic specimens from 4701 culture-confirmed S. aureus cases
and 45 344 matched controls; 584 535 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 
genotyped on an array specific to individuals of European ancestry. Coverage was 
increased by imputation of >25 million common SNPs, using the 1000 Genomes
Reference panel. In addition, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotypes were also
imputed.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis, performed under the assumption of an
additive genetic model, revealed several imputed SNPs (eg, rs115231074: odds
ratio [OR], 1.22 [P = 1.3 × 10(-10)]; rs35079132: OR, 1.24 [P = 3.8 × 10(-8)])
achieving genome-wide significance on chromosome 6 in the HLA class II region.
One adjacent genotyped SNP was nearly genome-wide significant (rs4321864: OR,
1.13; P = 8.8 × 10(-8)). These polymorphisms are located near the genes encoding 
HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1. Results of further logistic regression analysis, in which
the most significant GWAS SNPs were conditioned on HLA-DRB1*04 serotype, showed
additional support for the strength of association between HLA class II genetic
variants and S. aureus infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results are the first reported evidence of human genetic
susceptibility to S. aureus infection.
