BACKGROUND: Normal thymocyte precursors in secondary lymphoid organs have
previously been described. It is important to recognize normal thymocyte
precursors by flow cytometry to differentiate them from T-cell lymphoblastic
leukemia.
METHODS: A 3-year-old boy status 2 years post-allogenic cardiac transplant
underwent adenoidectomy to exclude post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. 
Microscopic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometry analyses of the adenoid were
performed.
RESULTS: By flow cytometry, a population of CD45+(dim)/CD7+(bright)/CD3- cells
were observed at 1.0% of lymphocytes. These cells expressed CD10, partial CD34,
and exhibited acquisition of CD4 followed by CD8. Within the brighter CD45+
lymphocytes, a population of CD3-/CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes and a similarly sized
population of CD4+/CD8+ cells exhibiting acquisition of low-density CD3 were
identified. By immunostaining, clusters of TdT+/CD1a+/CD4+/CD8+ T-cells were
identified in the interfollicular areas. Compared to normal thymus, thymocytes in
the adenoid tissue lacked the classic CD4xCD8 winged differentiation profile but 
showed a normal early precursor pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: Thymocytes in adenoid show a similar differentiation pattern to
thymus and thymoma. However, the classic winged pattern of common thymocyte
differentiation may not be readily apparent in thymocytes differentiating outside
of the thymus. Recognition of the early thymocyte precursor antigen acquisition
profile can be crucial to correct interpretation. © 2017 International Clinical
