The antigenic peptides processed by β-cells and presented through surface HLA
class I molecules are poorly characterized. Each HLA variant (e.g., the most
common being HLA-A2 and HLA-A3) carries some peptide-binding specificity. Hence, 
features that, despite these specificities, remain shared across variants may
reveal factors favoring β-cell immunogenicity. Building on our previous
description of the HLA-A2/A3 peptidome of β-cells, we analyzed the
HLA-A3-restricted peptides targeted by circulating CD8+ T cells. Several peptides
were recognized by CD8+ T cells within a narrow frequency (1-50/106), which was
similar in donors with and without type 1 diabetes and harbored variable
effector/memory fractions. These epitopes could be classified as conventional
peptides or neoepitopes, generated either via peptide cis-splicing or mRNA
splicing (e.g., secretogranin-5 [SCG5]-009). As reported for HLA-A2-restricted
peptides, several epitopes originated from β-cell granule proteins (e.g., SCG3,
SCG5, and urocortin-3). Similarly, H-2Kd-restricted CD8+ T cells recognizing the 
murine orthologs of SCG5, urocortin-3, and proconvertase-2 infiltrated the islets
of NOD mice and transferred diabetes into NOD/scid recipients. The finding of
granule proteins targeted in both humans and NOD mice supports their disease
relevance and identifies the insulin granule as a rich source of epitopes,
possibly reflecting its impaired processing in type 1 diabetes.
