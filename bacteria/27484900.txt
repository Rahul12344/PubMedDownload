BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence and clinical studies in breast cancer suggest
that some anti-tumor therapy regimens generate stimulation of the immune system
that accounts for tumor clinical responses, however, demonstration of the
immunostimulatory power of these therapies on cancer patients continues to be a
formidable challenge. Here we present experimental evidence from a breast cancer 
patient with complete clinical response after 7 years, associated with
responsiveness of tumor specific T cells.
METHODS: T cells were obtained before and after anti-tumor therapy from
peripheral blood of a 63-years old woman diagnosed with ductal breast cancer
(HER2/neu+++, ER-, PR-, HLA-A*02:01) treated with surgery, followed by
paclitaxel, trastuzumab (suspended due to cardiac toxicity), and radiotherapy. We
obtained a leukapheresis before surgery and after 8 months of treatment. Using in
vitro cell cultures stimulated with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells
(DCs) that produce high levels of IL-12, we characterize by flow cytometry the
phenotype of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) HER2/neu and NY-ESO 1 specific T
cells. The ex vivo analysis of the TCR-Vβ repertoire of TAA specific T cells in
blood and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) were performed in order to
correlate both repertoires prior and after therapy.
RESULTS: We evidence a functional recovery of T cell responsiveness to polyclonal
stimuli and expansion of TAAs specific CD8+ T cells using peptide pulsed DCs,
with an increase of CTLA-4 and memory effector phenotype after anti-tumor
therapy. The ex vivo analysis of the TCR-Vβ repertoire of TAA specific T cells in
blood and TILs showed that whereas the TCR-Vβ04-02 clonotype is highly expressed 
in TILs the HER2/neu specific T cells are expressed mainly in blood after
therapy, suggesting that this particular TCR was selectively enriched in blood
after anti-tumor therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the benefits of anti-tumor therapy in a breast
cancer patient with clinical complete response in two ways, by restoring the
responsiveness of T cells by increasing the frequency and activation in
peripheral blood of tumor specific T cells present in the tumor before therapy.
