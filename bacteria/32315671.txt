c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a critical mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) implicated in inflammatory processes, with IQ-1S
(11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime sodium salt) being a high-affinity JNK 
inhibitor with pronounced anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we studied direct
effects of IQ-1S on phenotypical and cytokine-producing characteristics of
activated human monocytes/macrophages and T cells in vitro. Purified
monocyte/macrophage cells were activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS,
1 μg/ml) for 24 h, while T cells were activated by particles conjugated with
antibodies (Abs) against human CD2, CD3, and CD28 for 48 h. Treatment with IQ-1S 
(0.5-25 μМ) in the presence of LPS reduced percentages of CD197 (CCR7)-positive
cells in macrophage cultures, without affecting CD16+ (FcγRIII, low-affinity
Fc-receptor), CD119+ (interferon-γ receptor 1), and CD124+ (IL-4 receptor
α-subunit) cells. In addition, IQ-1S reduced production of tumour necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-10 in macrophage cultures.
In activated T cell cultures, IQ-1S decreased CD25+ cell numbers in both
CD4-positive and CD4-negative T cell compartments. Central memory СD45RA-/СD197+ 
and effector memory СD45RA-/СD197- T cells were more sensitive to IQ-1S-mediated 
suppression, as compared to naïve СD45RA+/СD197+ and terminally-differentiated
effector СD45RA+/СD197- T cells. IQ-1S also suppressed T-cell cytokine production
(IL-2, interferon-ɣ, IL-4, and IL-10). Collectively, the results suggest that
both human macrophage and T cells could be immediate cell targets for IQ-1S-based
anti-inflammatory immunotherapy. IQ-1S-mediated suppressive effects were unlikely
to be associated with macrophage/T helper polariation.
