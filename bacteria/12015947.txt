BACKGROUND: The isolation of Candida species in urine in patients admitted in
intensive care units who bear a vesical catheter is considered as a sign of bad
prognosis. The etiological mechanisms and the appropriateness of administering an
antifungal treatment in these patients is controversial.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: The prevalence of Candida species in urine and the in vitro 
susceptibility to fluconazole by means of the E-test were determined in 560
patients admitted in an intensive care unit.
RESULTS: In 60 patients (11%) Candida species was isolated in urine after
catheter replacement. 56.7% of isolates corresponded toC. albicans, 21.7% to C.
glabrata, 15% to C.tropicalis, 5% to C. parapsilosis and 1.7% to C.kefyr. Only
two isolates (C. albicans and C. glabrata)had a minimal inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) >= 64 microgram/ml (which was regarded as resistant) and 91% of strains had
a MIC between 0.125 and 8 microgram/ml. MIC 90% for C. albicans and C. tropicalis
was 1 microgram/ml,while it was 16 microgram/ml for C. glabrata. C. albicans is
the most frequent species isolated in urine in these patients. However,over 40%
of cases are found to have non-albicans species,especially C. glabrata and C.
tropicalis. The majority of Candida isolates (91%) are sensitive in vitro to
fluconazole.
