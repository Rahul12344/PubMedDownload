We evaluated whether signals transmitted through the T cell receptor (TCR) can
activate naive CD4 T cells expressing a transgenic TCR specific for a defined
peptide/MHC ligand in the absence of CD28/B7 costimulation. Our results showed
that CD28/B7 costimulation was required at low, but not at high, concentrations
of antigenic ligand. This was the case whether the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway 
was blocked by CTLA-4 Ig fusion protein or by the chemical fixation of
antigen-presenting cells. Naive CD4 cells stimulated with high concentrations of 
antigen and without CD28 costimulation produced low but detectable amounts of
IL-2 and interferon-gamma. Furthermore, naive CD4 T cells activated for a 7-day
period by either low or high concentrations of antigen with or without CD28
costimulation were functionally similar, indicating that signals transmitted
through the TCR were not intrinsically tolerogenic for CD4 T cells.
