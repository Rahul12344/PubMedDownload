The recent emergence and diffusion in the community of Escherichia coli isolates 
belonging to the multidrug-resistant and CTX-M-27-producing sequence type 131
(ST131) C1-M27 cluster makes this cluster potentially as epidemic as the
worldwide E. coli ST131 subclade C2 composed of multidrug-resistant isolates
producing CTX-M-15. Thirty-five extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
ST131 isolates were identified in a cohort of 1,885 French children over a 5-year
period. They were sequenced to characterize the ST131 E. coli isolates producing 
CTX-M-27 recently emerging in France. ST131 isolates producing CTX-M-27 (n = 17),
and particularly those belonging to the C1-M27 cluster (n = 14), carried many
resistance-encoding genes and predominantly an F1:A2:B20 plasmid type. In
multivariate analysis, having been hospitalized since birth (odds ratio [OR],
10.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4 to 48.8; P = 0.002) and being cared for
in a day care center (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.5 to 59.0; P = 0.017) were independent
risk factors for ST131 CTX-M-27 fecal carriage compared with ESBL-producing
non-ST131 isolates. No independent risk factor was found when comparing CTX-M-15 
(n = 11)- and CTX-M-1/14 (n = 7)-producing ST131 isolates with ESBL-producing
non-ST131 isolates or with non-ESBL-producing isolates. Several factors may
contribute to the increase in fecal carriage of CTX-M-27-producing E. coli
isolates, namely, resistance to multiple antibiotics, capacity of the CTX-M-27
enzyme to hydrolyze both cefotaxime and ceftazidime, carriage of a peculiar
F-type plasmid, and/or capacity to colonize children who have been hospitalized
since birth or who attend day care centers.
