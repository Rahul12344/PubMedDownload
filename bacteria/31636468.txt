Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells recognize activating self and microbial
lipids presented by CD1d. CD1d can also bind non-activating lipids, such as
sphingomyelin. We hypothesized that these serve as endogenous regulators and
investigated humans and mice deficient in acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), an enzyme 
that degrades sphingomyelin. We show that ASM absence in mice leads to diminished
CD1d-restricted antigen presentation and iNKT cell selection in the thymus,
resulting in decreased iNKT cell levels and resistance to iNKT cell-mediated
inflammatory conditions. Defective antigen presentation and decreased iNKT cells 
are also observed in ASM-deficient humans with Niemann-Pick disease, and ASM
activity in healthy humans correlates with iNKT cell phenotype. Pharmacological
ASM administration facilitates antigen presentation and restores the levels of
iNKT cells in ASM-deficient mice. Together, these results demonstrate that
control of non-agonistic CD1d-associated lipids is critical for iNKT cell
development and function in vivo and represents a tight link between cellular
sphingolipid metabolism and immunity.
