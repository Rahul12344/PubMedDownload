Effects of four aromatic organic pollutants on microbial glucose metabolism and
thymidine incorporation in marine sediments.

Bauer JE, Capone DG.

The metabolism of D-[U-14C]glucose and the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine 
by aerobic and anaerobic marine sediment microbes exposed to 1 to 1,000 ppm
anthracene, naphthalene, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and
pentachlorophenol were examined. Cell-specific rates of [14C]glucose metabolism
averaged 1.7 X 10(-21) and 0.5 X 10(-21) mol/min per cell for aerobic and
anaerobic sediment slurries, respectively; [3H]thymidine incorporation rates
averaged 43 X 10(-24) and 9 X 10(-24) mol/min per cell for aerobic and anaerobic 
slurries, respectively. Aerobic sediments exposed to three of the organic
pollutants for 2 to 7 days showed recovery of both activities. Anaerobic
sediments showed little recovery after 2 days of pre-exposure to the pollutants. 
We conclude that (i) anaerobic sediments are more sensitive than aerobic
sediments to pollutant additions; (ii) [3H]thymidine incorporation is more
sensitive to pollutant additions than is [14C]glucose metabolism; and (iii) the
toxicity of the pollutants increased in the following order: anthracene,
p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, naphthalene, and pentachlorophenol.
