While dogs are increasingly being utilized as large-animal models of disease,
important features of age-related immunosenescence in the dog have yet to be
evaluated due to the lack of defined naïve vs. memory T lymphocyte phenotypes. We
therefore performed multi-color flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from young and aged beagles, and determined the differential cytokine
production by proposed memory subsets. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in aged dogs
displayed increased cytokine production, and decreased proliferative capacity.
Antibodies targeting CD45RA and CD62L, but less so CD28 or CD44, defined canine
cells that consistently exhibited properties of naïve-, central memory-, effector
memory-, and terminal effector-like CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets. Older
dogs demonstrated decreased frequencies of naïve-like CD4+ and CD8+ T
lymphocytes, and an increased frequency of terminal effector-like CD8+ T
lymphocytes. Overall findings revealed that aged dogs displayed features of
immunosenescence similar to those reported in other species.
