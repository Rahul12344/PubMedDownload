The cyclo-l-Trp-l-Trp (cWW, 1) tailoring P450 GutD2774 from Streptomyces
lavendulae was characterized by expression in Streptomyces coelicolor, precursor 
feeding and enzyme assays. GutD2774 catalyzes mainly the transfer of hypoxanthine
to C2 and C3 of the indole ring of 1. cWW adducts with guanine were detected as
minor products. An orthologous cluster was identified in Streptomyces
xanthophaeus. These results expand the spectrum of cyclodipeptide derivatives by 
involvement of an additional nucleobase and identification of new coupling
patterns.
