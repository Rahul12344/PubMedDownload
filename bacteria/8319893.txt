The C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa247-370) of Clostridium perfringens 
has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Antiserum raised against
cpa247-370 reacted in an identical manner to anti-alpha-toxin serum when used to 
map epitopes in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that cpa247-370 was
immunologically and structurally identical to this region in the alpha-toxin. The
isolated cpa247-370 was devoid of sphingomyelinase activity or haemolytic
activity and was not cytotoxic for mouse lymphocytes. Haemolytic activity was
detected when cpa247-370 was tested with the N-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin
(cpa1-249), confirming that cpa247-370 confers haemolytic properties on the
phospholipase C activity of the alpha-toxin. Haemolytic activity was not detected
if cpa247-370 was tested with the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine
phospholipase C, nor if cpa1-249 and cpa247-370 were incubated sequentially with 
erythrocytes.
