Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative microorganism that causes a severe
pneumonia known as "legionnaires disease." Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) transduces
the lipopolysaccharide signal and is therefore considered to play a role in host 
defense against gram-negative bacterial infection. To determine the role of TLR4 
in L. pneumophila pneumonia, C3H/HeJ mice, which display a nonfunctional gene
encoding TLR4 (TLR4), and wild-type (wt) C3H/HeN mice were intranasally
inoculated with L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Infection proceeded in an identical
way in TLR4 mutant and wt mice, as reflected by similar bacterial outgrowth in
the lungs. In addition, the inflammatory responses to L. pneumophila infection-as
assessed by histopathologic analysis, cell influx in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid, myeloperoxidase activity in lungs, and lung cytokine concentrations-were
indistinguishable in TLR4 mutant and wt mice. These data suggest that, in this
mouse model, TLR4 does not play a role in resistance to L. pneumophila.
