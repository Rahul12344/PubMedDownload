The cyanobacterial aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (cADO) is a key enzyme that
catalyzes the unusual deformylation of aliphatic aldehydes for alkane
biosynthesis and can be applied to the production of biofuel in vitro and
in vivo. In this study, we determined crystal structures of two ADOs from
Limnothrix sp. KNUA012 (LiADO) and Oscillatoria sp. KNUA011 (OsADO). The
structures of LiADO and OsADO resembled those of typical cADOs, consisting of
eight α-helices found in ferritin-like di-iron proteins. However, structural
comparisons revealed that while the LiADO active site was vacant of iron and
substrates, the OsADO active site was fully occupied, containing both a
coordinated metal ion and substrate. Previous reports indicated that helix 5 is
capable of adopting two distinct conformations depending upon the existence of
bound iron. We observed that helix 5 of OsADO with an iron bound in the active
site presented as a long helix, whereas helix 5 of LiADO, which lacked iron in
the active site, presented two conformations (one long and two short helices),
indicating that an equilibrium exists between the two states in solution.
Furthermore, acquisition of a structure having a fully occupied active site is
unique in the absence of higher iron concentrations as compared with other cADO
structures, wherein low affinity for iron complicates the acquisition of crystal 
structures with bound iron. An in-depth analysis of the ADO apo-enzyme, the
enzyme with substrate bound, and the enzyme with both iron and substrate bound
provided novel insight into substrate-binding modes in the absence of a
coordinated metal ion and suggested a separate two-step binding mechanism for
substrate and iron co-factors. Moreover, our results provided a comprehensive
structural basis for conformational changes induced by binding of the substrate
and co-factor.
