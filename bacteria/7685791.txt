In this study we have demonstrated that costimulation for TSST-1-induced T cell
proliferation is provided by HLA class II negative accessory B cells. In
addition, TSST-1 binding to these HLA class II negative accessory B cells could
not be detected by immunocytofluorescence, or in a system in which T cell
proliferation depended on TSST-1 pretreated HLA class II negative B cells. These 
findings suggest that accessory signals can be supplied by B cells that are not
involved in the activation of T cells via Ag-HLA/TCR-CD3 complex interaction: TCR
ligation by a TSST-1/HLA complex and costimulation need not be delivered by the
same cell. In the presence of HLA class II negative B cells, T cell proliferation
in response to TSST-1 could be achieved despite addition of a mAb that can block 
HLA class II binding sites for TSST-1. These findings suggest the possibility
that TSST-1 may directly ligate TCR. In the presence of anti-BB1-treated HLA
class II negative accessory cells, TSST-1-induced T cell proliferation was
inhibited by over 50% indicating the involvement of the BB1/CD28 pathway. The
leukemic pre-B cell lines NALM-6, and BLIN-1, both of which express surface HLA
class II Ag, but not the costimulatory B cell activation Ag BB1, were deficient
in their accessory function for T cell proliferation in response to the
superantigen TSST-1 and the mitogen Con A.
