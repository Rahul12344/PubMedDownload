CD1 molecules are glycoproteins that present lipid antigens at the cell surface
for immunological recognition by specialized populations of T lymphocytes. Prior 
experimental data suggest a wide variety of lipid species can bind to CD1
molecules, but little is known about the characteristics of cellular ligands that
are selected for presentation. Here we have molecularly characterized lipids
bound to the human CD1d isoform. Ligands were eluted from secreted CD1d molecules
and separated by normal phase HPLC, then characterized by mass spectroscopy. A
total of 177 lipid species were molecularly identified, comprising
glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. The glycerophospholipids included common 
diacylglycerol species, reduced forms known as plasmalogens, lyso-phospholipids
(monoacyl species), and cardiolipins (tetraacyl species). The sphingolipids
included sphingomyelins and glycosylated forms, such as the ganglioside GM3.
These results demonstrate that human CD1d molecules bind a surprising diversity
of lipid structures within the secretory pathway, including compounds that have
been reported to play roles in cancer, autoimmune diseases, lipid signaling, and 
cell death.
