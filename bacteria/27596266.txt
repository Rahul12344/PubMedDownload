Understanding how memory B cells are induced and relate to long-lived plasma
cells is important for vaccine development. Immunity to oral vaccines has been
considered short-lived because of a poor ability to develop IgA B-cell memory.
Here we demonstrate that long-lived mucosal IgA memory is readily achieved by
oral but not systemic immunization in mouse models with NP hapten conjugated with
cholera toxin and transfer of B1-8(high)/GFP(+) NP-specific B cells.
Unexpectedly, memory B cells are poorly related to long-lived plasma cells and
less affinity-matured. They are α4β7-integrin(+)CD73(+)PD-L2(+)CD80(+) and at
systemic sites mostly IgM(+), while 80% are IgA(+) in Peyer's patches. On
reactivation, most memory B cells in Peyer's patches are GL7(-), but expand in
germinal centres and acquire higher affinity and more mutations, demonstrating
strong clonal selection. CCR9 expression is found only in Peyer's patches and
appears critical for gut homing. Thus, gut mucosal memory possesses unique
features not seen after systemic immunization.
