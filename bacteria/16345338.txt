The attachment of a marine Pseudomonas sp. to a variety of surfaces was
investigated, and the number of bacteria which became attached was related to the
surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity of the substratum. Large numbers of
bacteria attached to hydrophobic plastics with little or no surface charge
[Teflon, polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate)]; moderate
numbers attached to hydrophilic metals with a positive (platinum) or neutral
(germanium) surface charge; and very few attached to hydrophilic, negatively
charged substrata (glass, mica, oxidized plastics). The results suggest that both
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are involved in bacterial attachment.
