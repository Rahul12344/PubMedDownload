The aim of this study was to determine whether Desulfovibrio
desulfuricans-derived LPS stimulate the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from ECs and the
expression of their adhesion molecules at the transcriptional level. Confluent
monolayers of HUVEC were incubated in the absence or presence of 20 microg/ml and
60 microg/ml LPSs derived from the DdT and DdA bacterial strains. Also, the
simultaneous stimulation of cells with LPSs and IL-1beta was evaluated. The
levels of cytokines released were measured using ELISA. LPS-activated HUVEC
increased the secretion of both IL-6 and IL-8, which was not LPS dose dependent. 
The expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 was assessed by TR-PCR. The transcripts
were detectable at all the concentrations (20, 40, 60 microg/ml) of LPSs used.
These results suggest that D. desulfuricans LPS may activate immune functions in 
endothelial cells and influence the inflammatory response during bacteremia
caused by these bacteria.
