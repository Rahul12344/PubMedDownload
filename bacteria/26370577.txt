Calcium deposited within a root canal due to exogenous stimuli may hamper root
canal treatment. In endodontic treatment, an operating microscope allows the
conditions within the root canal to be directly viewed and evaluated. This report
describes a case in which an operating microscope was used to facilitate the
excision of a calcified structure from within a root canal at an early stage in
the treatment of an infection. An 18-year-old man was referred to our clinic due 
to suspected chronic suppurative apical periodontitis of the right maxillary
central incisor. Periapical radiography confirmed the presence of a radioopaque
structure inside the root canal that was likely to pose an obstacle to endodontic
treatment. After opening the pulp chamber, an operating microscope was used to
directly confirm the presence of the calcified structure in the root canal, which
was removed using an ultrasonic tip. The infected root canal was treated using
calcium hydroxide. Two months later, closure of the apical foramen as a result of
calcification of the apical foramen was confirmed and the root canal filled.
Using an operating microscope to directly view a structure posing an obstacle to 
root canal treatment made it possible to perform an excision while avoiding risks
such as canal perforation.
