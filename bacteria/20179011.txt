It is proposed that post-harvest longevity and appearance of salad crops is
closely linked to pre-harvest leaf morphology (cell and leaf size) and
biophysical structure (leaf strength). Transgenic lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa 
cv. Valeria) were produced in which the production of the cell wall-modifying
enzyme xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) was down-regulated by
antisense inhibition. Independently transformed lines were shown to have multiple
members of the LsXTH gene family down-regulated in mature leaves of 6-week-old
plants and during the course of shelf life. Consequently, xyloglucan
endotransglucosylase (XET) enzyme activity and action were down-regulated in the 
cell walls of these leaves and it was established that leaf area and fresh weight
were decreased while leaf strength was increased in the transgenic lines.
Membrane permeability was reduced towards the end of shelf life in the transgenic
lines relative to the controls and bacteria were evident inside the leaves of
control plants only. Most importantly, an extended shelf-life of transgenic lines
was observed relative to the non-transgenic control plants. These data illustrate
the potential for engineering cell wall traits for improving quality and
longevity of salad crops using either genetic modification directly, or by using 
markers associated with XTH genes to inform a commercial breeding programme.
