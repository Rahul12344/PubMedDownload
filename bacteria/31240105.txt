HLA-VBSeq is an HLA calling tool developed to infer the most likely HLA types
from high-throughput sequencing data. However, there is still room for
improvement in specific genetic groups because of the diversity of HLA alleles in
human populations. Here, we present HLA-VBSeq v2, a software application that
makes use of a new Japanese HLA reference panel to enhance calling accuracy for
Japanese HLA class-I genes. Our analysis showed significant improvements in
calling accuracy in all HLA regions, with prediction accuracies achieving over
99.0, 97.8, and 99.8% in HLA-A, B and C, respectively.
