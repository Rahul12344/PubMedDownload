Introduction: Low and middle income countries are disproportionately affected
with road traffic injuries and the lower extremity is one of the most affected
anatomical body parts. There exist very limited data on the pattern of lower
extremity injuries in the Cameroon especially in the South West Region. We
therefore, hypothesized that lower limb injuries are common in road traffic
crashes and motorized two wheelers are the commonest cause.
Methods: This was a hospital based prospective, cross sectional study. It
involved four hospitals (Limbe and Buea Regional Hospitals, Baptist hospital
Mutengene and Tiko District Hospital) in the Fako Division. It was carried out
for three months. Victims of road traffic crashes received at emergency
department of these hospitals during this period were assessed. Crash
characteristics and injury characteristics were assessed and recorded.
Results: We analyzed 411 crash victims, 197(47.93%) had lower extremity injuries.
The male to female ratio was 1.4:1. Majority of crash victims were in their 3rd
and 4th decades of life. The mean age of patients who had lower limb injuries was
33.30(Â±16.04). The most vulnerable road users were pedestrians (26.52%) and
passengers on motor bikes (38.44%) and the commonest mechanism by which crash
victims sustained injuries were: bike-car collisions (22.84%), and
bike-pedestrian collisions (19.29%). Commercial motor bikes (62.77%) and taxis
(22.38%) were the road users most involved in road traffic collisions. The leg
98(49.75%), thigh 23(11.68%), and knee 20(10.15%) were the most injured
anatomical parts of the lower extremity. Fractures 68 (34.52%), lacerations
53(26.90%), and bruises 49(24.87%) were the most recurrent pattern of lower
extremity injuries.
Conclusion: In view of our findings we conclude therefore as follows: The
prevalence of lower extremity injuries from Road Traffic Crashes in our study
area was 47.93%. Associated risk factors to the road traffic crashes as
identified by the victims were bad roads (10.15%) and bad weather (5.05%). The
safety gargets were not adequately utilized by our victims, with 87.72%
confirming that they did not wear the helmet and 87.50% affirming that they did
not wear the seat belt at the time of the crash. The occupations mostly affected 
in our series were pupils and students (20.3%) and business people (19.2%), then 
the bike riders (15.23%). We thus recommend that the laws on the use of road
safety gargets, especially helmets and seatbelts, be enforced, with riding and
driving speeds reduced to below 60km/hour. Road usage should be avoided in bad
weather and pedestrians lanes and zebra crossings be provided to minimize
pedestrian-car or -bike collision.
