BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with activation of platelets and endothelial
cells accompanied by enhanced P-selectin surface expression. Both platelet- and
endothelial P-selectin have been associated with leukocyte recruitment and
induction of inflammatory alterations. Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae is a common
human sepsis pathogen, particularly in the context of pneumonia.
METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and P-selectin-deficient (Selp(-/-) ) mice or bone marrow
chimeric mice were infected with K. pneumoniae via the airways to induce
pneumosepsis. Mice were sacrificed during early (12 h after infection) or
late-stage (44 h) sepsis for analyses, or followed in a survival study.
RESULTS: Selp(-/-) mice displayed 10-1000-fold higher bacterial burdens in the
lungs, blood and distant organs during late-stage sepsis. P-selectin deficiency
did not influence leukocyte recruitment to the lungs, but was associated with
decreased platelet-monocyte complexes and increased cytokine release. Bone marrow
transfer studies revealed a role for both platelet and endothelial cell
P-selectin as mice deficient in platelet or endothelial cell P-selectin displayed
an intermediate phenotype in bacterial loads and survival compared with full
wild-type or full knockout control mice.
CONCLUSION: Both platelet and endothelial cell P-selectin contribute to host
defense during Klebsiella pneumosepsis.
