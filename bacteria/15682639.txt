Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis caused by a group of 
different dematiaceous fungi, first described by Rudolph in 1914. In Brazil there
is a clear predominance of Fonsecaea pedrosoi. Sixty sera samples obtained from
patients with F. pedrosoi-caused CBM were analysed. Sera obtained from 36
sporothricosis (SPT) patients, 34 cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients and from 
48 blood donors (HBD) were used as control. F. pedrosoi metabolic antigen was
obtained from F. pedrosoi sample no. 884 (Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São
Paulo Collection). IE reaction disclosed an anodic migrating arch, which was
eluted and used as antigen. Both metabolic and eluate F. pedrosoi antigens were
submitted to SDS-PAGE and two fractions, weighing approximately 54 and 66 kDa
were identified. The 66-kDa fraction reacted against 43 of 60 CBM (71.7%) sera
samples and was recognized by 10 SPT and eight CL sera (15.3%). No reactivity was
observed against HBD sera. The 54-kDa fraction reacted against 58 of 60 CBM sera 
(96.7% sensitivity) and was not recognized by HBD, SPT nor CL sera (100%
specificity). Such high sensitivity and specificity levels suggest this antigenic
fraction is immunodominant and might prove a useful tool for further studies on
F. pedrosoi-caused CBM.
