A series of novel N-benzylidenesulfonohydrazide compounds were designed and
synthesized as inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid: L-alanine ligase (MurC)
and UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine: D-glutamate ligase (MurD) from E. coli,
involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell-walls. Some compounds possessed
inhibitory activity against both enzymes with IC(50) values as low as 30 microM. 
In addition, a new, one-pot synthesis of amidobenzaldehydes is reported.
