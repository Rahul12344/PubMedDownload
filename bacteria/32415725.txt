AIM: SLC26A3 (DRA) mediates the absorption of luminal Cl- in exchange for HCO3 - 
in the distal intestine. Its expression is lost in congenital chloride diarrhoea 
(CLD) and strongly decreased in the presence of intestinal inflammation. To
characterize the consequences of a loss of Slc26a3 beyond disturbed electrolyte
transport, colonic mucus synthesis, surface accumulation and composition, pH
microclimate, microbiome composition and development of inflammation was studied 
in slc26a3-/- mice.
METHODS: The epithelial surface pH microclimate and the surface mucus
accumulation in vivo was assessed by two photon microscopy in exteriorized mid
colon of anaesthetized slc26a3-/- and wt littermates. Mucus synthesis,
composition and inflammatory markers were studied by qPCR and
immunohistochemistry and microbiome composition by 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Colonic pH microclimate was significantly more acidic in slc26a3-/- and 
to a lesser extent in cftr-/- than in wt mice. Goblet cell thecae per crypt were 
decreased in slc26a3-/- and increased in cftr-/- colon. Mucus accumulation in
vivo was reduced, but much less so than in cftr-/- colon, which is possibly
related to the different colonic fluid balance. Slc26a3-/- colonic luminal
microbiome displayed strong decrease in diversity. These alterations preceded and
maybe causally related to increased mucosal TNFα mRNA expression levels and
leucocyte infiltration in the mid-distal colon of slc26a3-/- but not of cftr-/-
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may explain the strong increase in the susceptibility
of slc26a3-/- mice to DSS damage, and offer insight into the mechanisms leading
to an increased incidence of intestinal inflammation in CLD patients.
