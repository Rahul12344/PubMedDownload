Seven-carbon-chain-containing sugars exist in several groups of important
bacterial natural products. Septacidin represents a group of l-heptopyranoses
containing nucleoside antibiotics with antitumor, antifungal, and pain-relief
activities. Hygromycin B, an aminoglycoside anthelmintic agent used in swine and 
poultry farming, represents a group of d-heptopyranoses-containing antibiotics.
To date, very little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds. Here we 
sequenced the genome of the septacidin producer and identified the septacidin
gene cluster by heterologous expression. After determining the boundaries of the 
septacidin gene cluster, we studied septacidin biosynthesis by in vivo and in
vitro experiments and discovered that SepB, SepL, and SepC can convert
d-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S-7-P) to ADP-l-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose,
exemplifying the involvement of ADP-sugar in microbial natural product
biosynthesis. Interestingly, septacidin, a secondary metabolite from a
gram-positive bacterium, shares the same ADP-heptose biosynthesis pathway with
the gram-negative bacterium LPS. In addition, two acyltransferase-encoding genes 
sepD and sepH, were proposed to be involved in septacidin side-chain formation
according to the intermediates accumulated in their mutants. In hygromycin B
biosynthesis, an isomerase HygP can recognize S-7-P and convert it to
ADP-d-glycero-β-d-altro-heptose together with GmhA and HldE, two enzymes from the
Escherichia coli LPS heptose biosynthetic pathway, suggesting that the
d-heptopyranose moiety of hygromycin B is also derived from S-7-P. Unlike the
other S-7-P isomerases, HygP catalyzes consecutive isomerizations and controls
the stereochemistry of both C2 and C3 positions.
