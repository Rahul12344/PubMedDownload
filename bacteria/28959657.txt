The association between genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family
genes and pathological conditions related to long-term exposure to organochlorine
compounds (OCs) deserves further elucidation. OCs are persistent organic
pollutants with bioaccumulative and lipophilic characteristics. They can act as
endocrine disruptors and perturb cellular mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to OCs
has been associated with different pathological manifestations. CYP genes are
responsible for transcribing enzymes essential in xenobiotic metabolism.
Therefore, polymorphisms in these genetic sequences a. alter the metabolic
pathways, b. induce false cellular responses, and c. may provoke pathological
conditions. The main aim of this review is to define the interaction between
parameters a, b and c at a mechanistic/molecular level, with references in
clinical cases.
