INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a systemic, chronic inflammatory disease that not only
afflicts the skin but is also associated with cardiovascular disease and
metabolic syndrome. The strongest susceptibility loci for the disease is within
the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, though specific HLA allelic
associations vary between populations.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate HLA associations with clinical
phenotypes of psoriasis and metabolic syndrome in Chinese psoriasis cases.
METHODS: We conducted an observational case-control study in Singapore with a
cohort of psoriasis cases consecutively recruited from an outpatient specialist
dermatological center (n = 120) compared with 130 healthy controls.
RESULTS: Significant HLA associations with psoriasis were observed with
HLA-A*02:07, B*46:01, C*01:02, and C*06:02. The three-locus haplotype of
A*02:07-C*01:02-B*46:01 was also significant (odds ratio [OR] 3.07;
p = 9.47 × 10-5). We also observed an association between nail psoriasis and
HLA-A*02:07 carriers (OR 4.50; p = 0.002), whereas C*06:02 carriers were less
prone to have nail involvement (OR 0.16; p = 0.004). HLA-A*02:07 was also
identified as a possible risk allele for hypertension (OR 2.90; p < 0.05), and
C*01:02 was a possible risk allele for dyslipidemia (OR 3.36; p < 0.05), both
known to be common comorbidities in patients with psoriasis.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the growing importance of discerning
population-specific clinical phenotypes and their association with certain HLA
alleles in psoriasis.
