Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a CD1d-restricted T cell population
that can respond to lipid antigenic stimulation within minutes by secreting a
wide variety of cytokines. This broad functional scope has placed iNKT cells at
the frontlines of many kinds of immune responses. Although the diverse functional
capacities of iNKT cells have long been acknowledged, only recently have distinct
iNKT cell subsets, each with a marked functional predisposition, been
appreciated. Furthermore, the subsets can frequently occupy distinct niches in
different tissues and sometimes establish long-term tissue residency where they
can impact homeostasis and respond quickly when they sense perturbations. In this
review, we discuss the developmental origins of the iNKT cell subsets, their
localization patterns, and detail what is known about how different subsets
specifically influence their surroundings in conditions of steady and diseased
states.
