Acute K depletion in the rhizosphere can lead to increased root uptake of
radiocesium. Two processes can govern this increase: the very low uptake of
potassium and the weathering of Cs-fixing clay minerals. Their respective
importance is, however, unknown. We investigated the effects of these processes
on radiocesium mobilization by roots of willow (Salix viminalis L.) from three
micas: muscovite, biotite, and phlogopite. Willows were grown in a mixed
quartz-mica substrate with the three respective (134)Cs-contaminated micas as
sole sources of potassium and radiocesium. After 7 wk of plant growth, the micas 
were partially weathered. The degree of mica weathering and the prevalent
potassium concentration in the solution increased in the order muscovite (5-11
microM K) < biotite (25-32 microM K) < phlogopite (25-35 microM K). The
mobilization and root uptake of radiocesium were negligible with muscovite but
increased in the same order. These results show that mica weathering directly and
chiefly governs the mobility of radiocesium in K-depleted rhizosphere soil. The
low mobility of trace Cs in the muscovite rhizosphere is linked with the
dioctahedral character of this mica, and hence to its very low alterability.
