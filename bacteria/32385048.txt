CD8 T cells and NK cells are the two major cytotoxic lymphocytes that carry out
cell-mediated immunity and regulate other immune responses. However, we do not
completely understand human CD8 T cell and NK cell metabolic requirements and
they have not been compared in the same experiments. We activated human CD8 T
cells by two anti-CD3/CD28 mAb methods, and we stimulated both CD8 T cells and NK
cells with IL-12/IL-18. When glucose (Glc) could not be used, human CD8 T cells
either died or became hypofunctional, depending upon the anti-CD3/CD28 activation
method. In contrast, Glc starvation did not decrease the percentage of
IL-12/IL-18-stimulated human NK cells that made IFN-γ. NK cells were relatively
fuel resilient and used Glc, glutamine (Gln), fatty acid, or acetate to power
IFN-γ expression. Surprisingly, strongly activated human CD8 T cells required Gln
for glycolysis and Glc uptake. We showed that human CD8 T cells regulate Glc
uptake by a novel mechanism related to the TXNIP pleiotropic protein. These
conditions may be relevant to septic patients who have high blood Glc but low
Gln. Under the conditions tested, Gln did not change human NK cell TXNIP
expression. Our experiments reveal fundamental differences in human CD8 T cell
and NK cell metabolism and the fuels needed for IFN-γ production.
