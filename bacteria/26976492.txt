17α,20β-Dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17α,20βDiOH-P) and
17α,20β,21α-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20βOH-RSS) are the critical hormones
required for oocyte maturation in fish. We utilized B. megaterium's endogenous
20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20βHSD) for the efficient production of both
progestogens after genetically modifying the microorganism to reduce side-product
formation. First, the gene encoding the autologous cytochrome P450 CYP106A1 was
deleted, resulting in a strain devoid of any steroid hydroxylation activity.
Cultivation of this strain in the presence of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17αOH-P)
led to the formation of 17α,20α-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17α,20αDiOH-P) as a
major and 17α,20βDiOH-P as a minor product. Four enzymes were identified as
20αHSDs and their genes deleted to yield a strain with no 20αHSD activity. The
3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase FabG was found to exhibit
20βHSD-activity and overexpressed to create a biocatalyst yielding 0.22g/L
17α,20βDiOH-P and 0.34g/L 20βOH-RSS after 8h using shake-flask cultivation, thus 
obtaining products that are at least a thousand times more expensive than their
substrates.
