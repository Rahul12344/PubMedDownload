Reduced ocular pigmentation is common in Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi 
syndrome (PWS) and is long thought to be caused by OCA2 deletion. GABRB3 is
located in the 15q11-13 region flanked by UBE3A, GABRA5, GABRG3, and OCA2.
Mutations in GABRB3 have frequently been associated with epilepsy and autism,
consistent with its role in neurodevelopment. We report here a robust phenotype
in the mouse in which deletion of Gabrb3 alone causes nearly complete loss of
retinal pigmentation due to atrophied melanosomes, as evidenced by electron
microscopy. Using exome and RNA sequencing, we confirmed that only the Gabrb3
gene was disrupted while the Oca2 gene was intact. However, mRNA abundance of
Oca2 and other genes adjacent to Gabrb3 is substantially reduced in Gabrb3-/-
mice, suggesting complex transcriptional regulation in this region. These results
suggest that impairment in GABRB3 downregulates OCA2 and indirectly causes ocular
hypopigmentation and visual defects in AS and PWS.
