Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and it remains
one of the major bacterial infections worldwide. Innate immunity is an important 
arm of antimycobacterial host defence mechanism that senses various
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) of microbes by a variety of pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs). As per the recent discovery, Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) play a crucial role in the recognition of M. tb, this immune activation
occurs only in the presence of functional TLRs. Variants of TLRs may influence
their expression, function and alters the recognition or signalling mechanism,
which leads to the disease susceptibility. Hence, the identification of mutations
in these receptors could be used as a marker to screen the individuals who are at
risk. In this review, we discuss TLR SNPs and their signalling mechanism to
understand the susceptibility to TB for better therapeutic approaches.
