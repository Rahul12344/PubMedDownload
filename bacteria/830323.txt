Diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy by computed tomography.

Carroll BA, Lane B, Norman D, Enzmann D.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of
the central nervous system which predominantly affects immunologically
compromised hosts. The distinctive CT appearance in three documented cases
includes low-density lesions of central and convolutional white matter with
scalloped lateral borders. Lesions demonstrate no mass effect or contrast
material enhancement. Findings are discussed with reference to other entities
which may produce a similar CT appearance.
