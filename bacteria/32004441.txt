Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell costimulation mediated by CD28 and 4-1BB
is essential for CAR-T cell-induced tumor regression. However, CD28 and 4-1BB
differentially modulate kinetics, metabolism and persistence of CAR-T cells, and 
the mechanisms governing these differences are not fully understood. We found
that LCK recruited into the synapse of CD28-encoding CAR by co-receptors causes
antigen-independent CAR-CD3ζ phosphorylation and increased antigen-dependent
T cell activation. In contrast, the synapse formed by 4-1BB-encoding CAR recruits
the THEMIS-SHP1 phosphatase complex that attenuates CAR-CD3ζ phosphorylation. We 
further demonstrated that the CAR synapse can be engineered to recruit either LCK
to enhance the kinetics of tumor killing of 4-1BB CAR-T cells or SHP1 to tune
down cytokine release of CD28 CAR-T cells.
