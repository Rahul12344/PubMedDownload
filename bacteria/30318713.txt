C-C bond-forming reactions are key transformations for setting up the carbon
frameworks of organic compounds. In this context, Friedel-Crafts acylation is
commonly used for the synthesis of aryl ketones, which are common motifs in many 
fine chemicals and natural products. A bacterial multicomponent acyltransferase
from Pseudomonas protegens (PpATase) catalyzes such Friedel-Crafts C-acylation of
phenolic substrates in aqueous solution, reaching up to >99 % conversion without 
the need for CoA-activated reagents. We determined X-ray crystal structures of
the native and ligand-bound complexes. This multimeric enzyme consists of three
subunits: PhlA, PhlB, and PhlC, arranged in a Phl(A2 C2 )2 B4 composition. The
structure of a reaction intermediate obtained from crystals soaked with the
natural substrate 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)ethanone together with site-directed 
mutagenesis studies revealed that only residues from the PhlC subunits are
involved in the acyl transfer reaction, with Cys88 very likely playing a
significant role during catalysis. These structural and mechanistic insights form
the basis of further enzyme engineering efforts directed towards enhancing the
substrate scope of this enzyme.
