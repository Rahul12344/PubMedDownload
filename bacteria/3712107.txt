Changes in the tocopherol and unsaturated fatty acid constituents of spices after
pasteurization with superheated steam.

Marero LM, Homma S, Aida K, Fujimaki M.

The following five spices were pasteurized with superheated steam, as given in
parentheses: origanum (1 kg/cm2, 132 degrees C, 3.5 sec), laurel (0.5 kg/cm2, 118
degrees C, 3.5 sec), turmeric (2 kg/cm2, 160 degrees C, 5 sec), coriander (1
kg/cm2, 140 degrees C, 5 sec), and aniseed (1 kg/cm2, 140 degrees C 5 sec). The
detected tocopherols and other constituents were as follows: origanum (alpha-,
beta-, gamma-, delta-), laurel (alpha-, beta-), turmeric (so little that no
comparison could be made), coriander (almost no tocopherols), and aniseed
(alpha-, beta-, delta-). The tocopherols and unsaturated fatty acid constituents 
of origanum, laurel, aniseed and coriander underwent little change after
pasteurization with superheated steam, indicating stability, which may be due to 
the synergistic effect of tocopherols and phenolic compounds present in these
spices.
