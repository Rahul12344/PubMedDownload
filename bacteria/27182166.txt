AIM: To explore methylation of DAPK, THBS1, CDH-1, and p14 genes, and
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status in individuals harboring esophageal
columnar metaplasia.
METHODS: Distal esophageal mucosal samples obtained by endoscopy and
histologically diagnosed as gastric-type (non-specialized) columnar metaplasia,
were studied thoroughly. DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks, and methylation 
status of death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1),
cadherin-1 (CDH1), and p14 genes, was examined using a methyl-sensitive
polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and sodium bisulfite modification protocol. H.
pylori cagA status was determined by PCR.
RESULTS: In total, 68 subjects (33 females and 35 males), with a mean age of 52
years, were included. H. pylori cagA positive was present in the esophageal
gastric-type metaplastic mucosa of 18 individuals. DAPK, THSB1, CDH1, and p14
gene promoters were methylated by MS-PCR in 40 (58.8%), 33 (48.5%), 46 (67.6%),
and 23 (33.8%) cases of the 68 esophageal samples. H. pylori status was
associated with methylation of DAPK (P = 0.003) and THBS1 (P = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: DNA methylation occurs in cases of gastric-type (non-specialized)
columnar metaplasia of the esophagus, and this modification is associated with H.
pylori cagA positive infection.
