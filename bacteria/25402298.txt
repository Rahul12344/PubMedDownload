OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative organism in
community-acquired pneumonia responsible for millions of deaths every year.
DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa is an adaptor molecule for different myeloid
expressed receptors involved in innate immunity.
DESIGN: Animal study.
SETTING: University research laboratory.
SUBJECTS: DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa-deficient (dap12) and wild-type mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Mice were intranasally infected with S. pneumoniae. In addition,
ex vivo responsiveness of alveolar macrophages was examined.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: dap12 alveolar macrophages released more tumor
necrosis factor-Î± upon stimulation with S. pneumoniae and displayed increased
phagocytosis of this pathogen compared with wild-type cells. After infection with
S. pneumoniae via the airways, dap12 mice demonstrated reduced bacterial
outgrowth in the lungs together with delayed dissemination to distant body sites 
relative to wild-type mice. This favorable response in dap12 mice was accompanied
by reduced lung inflammation and an improved survival.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa impairs
host defense during pneumococcal pneumonia at the primary site of infection at
least in part by inhibiting phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.
