Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a cell wall component of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
induces the production of cytokines and chemokines in vitro. Interleukin-1 (IL-1)
contributes to granuloma formation in tuberculosis (TB), and exerts effects via
the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1R). To determine the effects of LAM in the
pulmonary compartment in vivo and to establish the role of endogenous IL-1
herein, normal and IL-1R deficient ((-/-)) mice were intranasally inoculated with
LAM (50 microgram). In normal mice, LAM resulted in a neutrophilic cell influx
into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). LAM also induced increases in the
lung concentrations of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), keratinocyte
(KC), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta.
IL-1R(-/-) mice had less influx of granulocytes in their BALF than wild-type
mice. Also, lung TNF-alpha levels were lower in IL-1R(-/-) mice. LAM may be an
important stimulator of innate immunity in infection with M. tuberculosis via
mechanisms that involve endogenous IL-1 activity.
