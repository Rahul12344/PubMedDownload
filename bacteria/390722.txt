Acute massive intravascular hemolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Atichartakarn V, Jootar S, Pathepchotiwong K, Srichaikul T.

Two cases of acute intravascular hemolysis complicating acute disseminated
intravascular coagulation were presented, one after normal delivery and the other
after group A beta hemolytic streptococcal septicemia complicating acute
myelomonoblastic leukemia. Neither case received heparin therapy. The first one
survived while the latter succumbed. Intravascular hemolysis may not be a bad
prognostic sign in such a condition.
