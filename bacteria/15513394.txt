looks?

In 1998 we presented 1 successfully treated case of Listeria monocytogenes
prosthetic valve endocarditis and made a review of all the cases that had been
published to date. We carry out an up-to-date review through Pub-Med of every
case of Listeria monocytogenes prosthetic valve endocarditis; mortality rate is
calculated and data from several clinical and therapeutical variables are
collected; Fisher's exact test is used to identify those variables significantly 
associated with mortality. Four out of 23 patients died in hospital (17%); among 
all the variables included, only peripheral embolism (p=0.024), onset on a
mechanical prosthesis (p=0.035) and having used only 1 antibiotic instead of a
combination of drugs (p=0.026) were independently associated with mortality.
Although the overall number of cases is too low to draw definite conclusions
(n=23), mortality rate is lower than previously believed. Some variables that
have traditionally been associated with a poor prognosis for endocarditides are
not for the case of Listeria monocytogenes on valvular prostheses. It seems
prudent to treat affected patients with a combination of ampicillin -- or
vancomycin, if there is a history of beta-lactam allergy and ampicillin
desensitization is not possible -- plus an aminoglycoside.
