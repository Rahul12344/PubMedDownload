Dendritic cells (DCs) that drain the gut and skin are known to favor the
establishment of T cell populations that home to the original site of DC-antigen 
(Ag) encounter by providing soluble "imprinting" signals to T cells in the lymph 
node (LN). To study the induction of lung T cell-trafficking, we used a
protein-adjuvant murine intranasal and intramuscular immunization model to
compare in vivo-activated Ag+ DCs in the lung and muscle-draining LNs. Higher
frequencies of Ag+ CD11b+ DCs were observed in lung-draining mediastinal LNs
(MedLN) compared to muscle-draining inguinal LNs (ILN). Ag+ CD11b+ MedLN DCs were
qualitatively superior at priming CD4+ T cells, which then expressed CD49a and
CXCR3, and preferentially trafficked into the lung parenchyma. CD11b+ DCs from
the MedLN expressed higher levels of surface podoplanin, Trem4, GL7, and the
known co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD24. Blockade of specific MedLN
DC molecules or the use of sorted DC and T cell co-cultures demonstrated that DC 
surface phenotype influences the ability to prime T cells that then home to the
lung. Thus, the density of dLN Ag+ DCs, and DC surface molecule signatures are
factors that can influence the output and differentiation of lung-homing CD4+ T
cells.
