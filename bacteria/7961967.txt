Topoisomerase II protein is essential for cell proliferation and is known to
exist as a phosphoprotein in cells from both lower and higher eukaryotic species.
In this paper, we have investigated the phosphorylation of the alpha isozyme of
human topoisomerase II. The topoisomerase II alpha protein was phosphorylated
predominantly on serine residues in the human tumor cell lines HeLa and NSCLC-3. 
Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping studies revealed several sites of 
phosphorylation in vivo, including a major site that was common to topoisomerase 
II alpha protein from both HeLa and NSCLC-3 cells. To identify sites of
phosphorylation, the regulatory C-terminal domain of human topoisomerase II alpha
protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion
protein and purified by nickel chelate chromatography. Tryptic phosphopeptide
mapping revealed that casein kinase II phosphorylated the C-terminal domain
primarily on 2 serine residues in vitro, which were shown to be sites of
modification in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified these casein
kinase II-specific phosphorylation sites as serine 1524 and serine 1376.
