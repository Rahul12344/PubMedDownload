Background: In order to identify potential activities against periodontal
diseases, eighteen dihydrochalcones and structurally related compounds were
tested in an established biological in vitro cell model of periodontal
inflammation using human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1 cells). Methods:
Subsequently to co-incubation of HGF-1 cells with a bacterial endotoxin
(Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, pgLPS) and each individual
dihydrochalcone in a concentration range of 1 µM to 100 µM, gene expression of
interleukin-8 (IL-8) was determined by qPCR and cellular interleukin-8 (IL-8)
release by ELISA. Results: Structure-activity analysis based on the
dihydrochalcone backbone and various substitution patterns at its aromatic ring
revealed moieties 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxy 3-methoxydihydrochalcone (7) to be the 
most effective anti-inflammatory compound, reducing the pgLPS-induced IL-8
release concentration between 1 µM and 100 µM up to 94%. In general, a
2,4,6-trihydroxy substitution at the A-ring and concomitant vanilloyl
(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy) pattern at the B-ring revealed to be preferable for IL-8
release inhibition. Furthermore, the introduction of an electronegative atom in
the A,B-linker chain led to an increased anti-inflammatory activity, shown by the
potency of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid N-vanillylamide (13). Conclusions: Our data may 
be feasible to be used for further lead structure designs for the development of 
potent anti-inflammatory additives in oral care products.
