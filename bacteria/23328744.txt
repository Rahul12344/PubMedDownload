Cell-free artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) were generated by coupling 
H-2K(b)/TRP2 tetramers together with anti-CD28 and anti-4-1BB antibodies onto
cell-sized latex beads and injected intravenously and subcutaneously into naïve
mice and antigen-primed mice (B6, H-2K(b)). Vigorous tumor antigen-specific CTL
responses in the native T-cell repertoire in each mouse model were elicited as
evaluated by measuring surface CD69 and CD25, intracellular IFN-γ, tetramer
staining and cytolysis of melanoma cells. Furthermore, the aAPCs efficiently
inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and markedly delayed tumor progression in
tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that bead-based aAPCs represent a
potential strategy for the active immunotherapy of cancers or persistent
infections.
