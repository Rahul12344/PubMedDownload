T lymphocytes recognize antigens consisting of peptides presented by class I and 
II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The peptides identified so
far have been predictable from the amino acid sequences of proteins. We have
identified the natural peptide target of a CTL clone that recognizes the
tyrosinase gene product on melanoma cells. The peptide results from
posttranslational conversion of asparagine to aspartic acid. This change is of
central importance for peptide recognition by melanoma-specific T cells, but has 
no impact on peptide binding to the MHC molecule. This posttranslational
modification has not been previously described for any MHC-associated peptide and
represents the first demonstration of posttranslational modification of a
naturally processed class I-associated peptide. This observation is relevant to
the identification and prediction of potential peptide antigens. The most likely 
mechanism for production of this peptide leads to the suggestion that antigenic
peptides can be derived from proteins that are translated into the endoplasmic
reticulum.
