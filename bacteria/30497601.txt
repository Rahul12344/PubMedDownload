Contamination of foodstuffs by potentially enteropathogenic Arcobacter spp. is
becoming a concern worldwide. However, few studies have examined
virulence-associated genes in isolates of Arcobacter spp. from food. Here, we
investigated the prevalence of three pathogenic Arcobacter species, A. butzleri, 
A. cryaerophilus, and A. skirrowii, in chicken, pork, and leafy green vegetables 
(n = 323) in South Korea. Samples were examined using two different protocols
selected from a literature review: Acrobacter selective broth (ASB)
II + Arcobacter selective medium (ASM) II (protocol A), and ASB II + modified
charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar supplemented with CAT (protocol B).
Overall, Arcobacter spp. were detected in 45.8% of food samples, and the recovery
rate of protocol B (37.8%) was significantly higher than that of protocol A
(30.7%) (p < 0.05). Refrigerated chicken gizzard samples showed the highest
detection rate (100%), followed by refrigerated chicken wing (79.5%), intestine
(77.3%), neck skin (63.3%), pork (55.6%), frozen chicken legs (5.0%), and leafy
green vegetables (4.4%) (p < 0.05). All isolates from chicken and leafy green
vegetables were identified as A. butzleri, whereas A. cryaerophilus and A.
skirrowii were mainly detected in pork. Most samples (95.8%) harbored more than
one of nine putative virulence factors (cadF, ciaB, cj1349, hecA, hecB, mviN,
pldA, irgA, and tlyA), and 91.3% harbored more than two. Isolates harboring all
nine putative virulence genes were obtained from 1.9% of samples: five pork and
one chicken. This study provides comprehensive and de facto evidence regarding
prevalence of an emerging pathogen, Arcobacter spp., in various foods, along with
their virulence potential. The results justify further research with respect to
their role in food safety.
