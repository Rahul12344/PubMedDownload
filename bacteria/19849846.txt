BACKGROUND: Foxp3 has been suggested to be a standard marker for murine Tregs
whereas its role as marker for human Tregs is controversial. While some reports
have shown that human Foxp3+ T cells had no regulatory function others have shown
their role in the inhibition of T cell proliferation.
METHODS: T cell activation was performed by means of brayostatin-1/ionomycin
(B/I), mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), and CD3/CD28 activation. T cell
proliferation was performed using BrdU and CFSE staining. Flow cytometry was
performed to determine Foxp3 expression, cell proliferation, viabilities and
phenotype analyses of T cells.
RESULTS: Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed Foxp3 upon activation in vitro.
Expression of Foxp3 remained more stable in CD4+CD25+ T cells compared to that in
CD8+CD25+ T cells. The CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells expressed CD44 and CD62L, showing 
their effector and memory phenotypes. Both FoxP3- responder T cells and
CD4+FoxP3+ T cells underwent proliferation upon CD3/CD28 activation.
CONCLUSION: Expression of Foxp3 does not necessarily convey regulatory function
in human CD4+CD25+ T cells. Increased FoxP3 on CD44+ effector and CD44+CD62L+
memory T cells upon stimulation suggest the activation-induced regulation of
FoxP3 expression.
