The surface properties of colicin E1, a 522-amino acid protein, and its
interaction with monolayers of Escherichia coli (E. coli) total lipid and
1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (DOPC) were studied using the
Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Colicin E1 is amphiphilic, forming a protein
monolayer at the air/buffer interface. The protein is thought to interact with
the E. coli total lipid head groups through electrostatic interactions, followed 
by its insertion into the lipid monolayers. Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) of E.
coli total lipid and DOPC, deposited onto mica at the cell membrane equivalence
pressure for E. coli and incubated with colicin E1, were imaged by contact mode
atomic force microscopy (CM-AFM). Colicin E1 formed protein aggregates on DOPC
SLBs, while E. coli total lipid SLB was deformed following its incubation with
colicin E1. Corresponding lateral force images, along with electrostatic surface 
potentials for colicin E1 P190, imply a direct interaction of colicin E1 with
lipid head groups facilitating their charge neutralization.
