The high number of the strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from
faeces, demonstrated that this bacteria takes the first place in diarrhoea. These
isolations had the same frequency all the year long. In infants, the
enteropathogenic E. coli (E. P. E. C.) (28.57%) are still frequent contrary to
developed countries. The E. coli with hemagglutination phenomenon (colonisation
factors) but without toxin detected were also responsible (mortality 6%). The E. 
coli without toxin and not belonging to E. P. E. C. group were also frequent
(71.42%). In adults, only the enteroinvasive E. coli (E. I. E. C.) (16.6%) and
the E. coli with hemagglutination but without toxin detected (16.6%) were
observed. This situation is due to bad hygienic conditions among the people and
the tropical climate.
