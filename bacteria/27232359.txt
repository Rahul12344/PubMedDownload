OBJECTIVE: Controversies exist regarding the relationship between the
concentrations of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and presence of dental caries in 
children. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine levels of AMPs in saliva of 
caries-free (CF), early childhood caries (ECC) and severe early childhood caries 
(S-ECC) children to determine if the levels of these salivary peptides
individually or in combinations were related to caries severity and mutans
streptococci levels.
DESIGN: 36 to 60 month-old children were selected to participate in this study.
Children were grouped into CF group (n=29), ECC group (n=25) and S-ECC group
(n=29). Saliva was collected from children for microbiological analysis by
culture. Salivary concentrations of cathelicidin LL-37, human β-defensin 2
(hBD-2), human β-defensin 3 (hBD-3) and histatin-5 (HTN-5) were determined by
ELISA.
RESULTS: Salivary concentrations of AMPs did not differ among CF, ECC and S-ECC
groups. Data showed positive correlations between mutans streptococci levels and 
salivary hBD-2 or HTN-5. Positive correlations were found between hBD-2, hBD-3,
LL-37 and HTN-5. Combinations among AMPs, mainly LL-37, were positively
associated with caries levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Salivary concentrations of AMPs individually were not associated
with the severity of early childhood caries. The stimulus of caries appears to
trigger a biological response, however, with a combination of these peptides.
