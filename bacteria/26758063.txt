Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication in elderly pneumonia patients
who have a rapid progression, and is accompanied by a high mortality rate.
Because the treatment options of ALI are limited to supportive care, identifying 
pneumonia patients who are at higher risk of ALI development is the emphasis of
many studies. Here, we approach this problem from an immunological perspective by
examining CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells, an important participant in acute and 
chronic inflammation. We find that elderly pneumonia patients have elevated
CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cell frequency compared to healthy individuals. This B 
cell population may express a higher level of IL-10, which has been was shown to 
suppress CD4(+) T cell-mediated proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNg) 
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) production, through an IL-10-dependent
mechanism. We also observe that the frequency of CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cell
is positively correlated with the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Tregs in
peripheral blood. Moreover, consistent with CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cell's
anti-inflammatory role, we find that pneumonia patients who later developed ALI
have reduced level of CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells. Together, our results
demonstrated that CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells in pneumonia patients possess
regulatory function in vivo, and are associated with a reduced ALI risk.
