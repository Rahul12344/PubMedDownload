Farmer's lung disease (FLD) is common in eastern France. It is the main form of
occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis, caused by chronic inhalation of
microorganisms (antigens) from mouldy hay, straw, or grain. The purpose of this
study was to assess, with a panel of data collected between 1997-2003,
environmental factors and agricultural practices that independently modify
concentrations in hay of microorganisms potentially responsible for FLD. A total 
of 629 hay samples from 86 farms were included in statistical analyses using
linear multilevel regression models allowing to consider the nested structure of 
the data: individual-level (batch of hay) and group-level (farm). The outcome
variable of these models was the concentration in hay (logarithmic value of
concentration+1) of microorganisms incriminated in FLD (Absidia corymbifera,
Eurotium spp., thermophilic actinomycetes). The simultaneous analysis of batch of
hay- and farm-level factors showed that bad climatic conditions of harvest,
high-density hay-packing modes, (especially round bales) and altitude (2nd
plateau, ]700-900] m) were the main factors associated with high concentrations
of these microorganisms in hay. This study allowed clarification of the factors
that influence the microbial concentration of hay with etiological agents of FLD.
