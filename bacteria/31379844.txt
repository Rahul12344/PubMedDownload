Interactions of human natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory receptors with
polymorphic HLA-A, -B and -C molecules educate NK cells for immune surveillance
against tumor cells. The KIR A haplotype encodes a distinctive set of
HLA-specific NK cell inhibiting receptors having strong influence on immunity. We
observed higher frequency of KIR A homozygosity among 745 healthy Chinese
Southern Han than 836 adult patients representing three types of leukemia: ALL
(OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.52-0.89, p = 0.004), AML (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.98, p
= 0.034), and CML (OR = 0.72 95% CI = 0.51-1.0, ns). We observed the same trend
for NHL (OR = 0.47 95% CI = 0.26-0.88 p = 0.017). For ALL, the protective effect 
of the KIR AA genotype was greater in the presence of KIR ligands C1 (Pc = 0.01) 
and Bw4 (Pc = 0.001), which are tightly linked in East Asians. By contrast, the
C2 ligand strengthened protection from CML (Pc = 0.004). NK cells isolated from
KIR AA individuals were significantly more cytotoxic toward leukemic cells than
those from other KIR genotypes (p < 0.0001). These data suggest KIR allotypes
encoded by East Asian KIR A haplotypes are strongly inhibitory, arming NK cells
to respond to leukemogenic cells having altered HLA expression. Thus, the study
of populations with distinct KIR and HLA distributions enlightens understanding
of immune mechanisms that significantly impact leukemia pathogenesis.
