The extraction of K(+) and SiO(2 )from silicate minerals by Bacillus
mucilaginosus in liquid culture was studied in incubation experiments. B.
mucilaginosus was found to dissolve soil minerals and mica and simultaneously
release K(+) and SiO(2) from the crystal lattices. In contrast, the bacterium did
not dissolve feldspar. B. mucilaginosus also produced organic acids and
polysaccharides during growth. The polysaccharides strongly adsorbed the organic 
acids and attached to the surface of the mineral, resulting in an area of high
concentration of organic acids near the mineral. The polysaccharides also
adsorbed SiO(2) and this affected the equilibrium between the mineral and fluid
phases and led to the reaction toward SiO(2 )and K(+) solubilization. These two
processes led to the decomposition of silicate minerals by the bacterium.
