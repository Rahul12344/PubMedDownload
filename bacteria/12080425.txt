The arabinose-inducible P(BAD) promoter suffers from all-or-none gene expression 
in which cells harboring the natively controlled arabinose transport gene (araE) 
are either induced or uninduced, the relative fraction of which is controlled by 
the concentration of arabinose. The population-averaged variation in expression
from P(BAD) as a function of inducer concentration is proportional to the
percentage of cells that are fully induced (vs. uninduced) rather than the level 
of expression in individual cells. Because of its undesirable effects on the
expression of heterologous genes, the all-or-none phenomenon was eliminated in
Escherichia coli by expression of araE from arabinose-independent (either the
Lactococcus lactis constitutive or IPTG-inducible lac) promoters. In these
arabinose-transport engineered cells, variation in P(BAD) expression with
arabinose concentration was a result of variation of the expression level in
individual cells with all cells in the population having approximately the same
induction level.
