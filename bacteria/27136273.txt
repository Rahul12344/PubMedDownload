Ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a Mg(2+) -dependent enzyme in the
branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway. It catalyses a complex two-part
reaction: an alkyl migration followed by a NADPH-dependent reduction. Both
reactions occur within the one active site, but in particular, the mechanism of
the isomerisation step is poorly understood. Here, using a combination of
kinetic, thermodynamic and spectroscopic techniques, the reaction mechanisms of
both Escherichia coli and rice KARI have been investigated. We propose a
conserved mechanism of catalysis, whereby a hydroxide, bridging the two Mg(2+)
ions in the active site, initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton from the 
C2 alcohol group of the substrate. While the μ-hydroxide-bridged dimetallic
centre is pre-assembled in the bacterial enzyme, in plant KARI substrate binding 
leads to a reduction of the metal-metal distance with the concomitant formation
of a hydroxide bridge. Only Mg(2+) is capable of promoting the isomerisation
reaction, likely to be due to non-competent substrate binding in the presence of 
other metal ions.
