Chlorophylls (Chls) are the most important cofactors for capturing solar energy
to drive photosynthetic reactions. Five spectral types of Chls have been
identified to date, with Chl f having the most red-shifted absorption maximum
because of a C21-formyl group substitution of Chl f However, the biochemical
provenance of this formyl group is unknown. Here, we used a stable isotope
labeling technique (18O and 2H) to determine the origin of the C21-formyl group
of Chl f and to verify whether Chl f is synthesized from Chl a in the
cyanobacterial species Halomicronema hongdechloris. In the presence of either
H218O or 18O2, the origin of oxygen atoms in the newly synthesized chlorophylls
was investigated. The pigments were isolated with HPLC, followed by MS analysis. 
We found that the oxygen atom of the C21-formyl group originates from molecular
oxygen and not from H2O. Moreover, we examined the kinetics of the labeling of
Chl a and Chl f from H. hongdechloris grown in 50% D2O-seawater medium under
different light conditions. When cells were shifted from white light D2O-seawater
medium to far-red light H2O-seawater medium, the observed deuteration in Chl f
indicated that Chl(ide) a is the precursor of Chl f Taken together, our results
advance our understanding of the biosynthesis pathway of the chlorophylls and the
formation of the formyl group in Chl f.
