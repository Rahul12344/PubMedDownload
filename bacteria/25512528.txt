The metalloprotease ADAMTS13 cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) within
endovascular platelet aggregates, and ADAMTS13 deficiency causes fatal
microvascular thrombosis. The proximal metalloprotease (M), disintegrin-like (D),
thrombospondin-1 (T), Cys-rich (C), and spacer (S) domains of ADAMTS13 recognize 
a cryptic site in VWF that is exposed by tensile force. Another seven T and two
complement C1r/C1s, sea urchin epidermal growth factor, and bone morphogenetic
protein (CUB) domains of uncertain function are C-terminal to the MDTCS domains. 
We find that the distal T8-CUB2 domains markedly inhibit substrate cleavage, and 
binding of VWF or monoclonal antibodies to distal ADAMTS13 domains relieves this 
autoinhibition. Small angle X-ray scattering data indicate that distal T-CUB
domains interact with proximal MDTCS domains. Thus, ADAMTS13 is regulated by
substrate-induced allosteric activation, which may optimize VWF cleavage under
fluid shear stress in vivo. Distal domains of other ADAMTS proteases may have
similar allosteric properties.
