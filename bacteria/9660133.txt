The present study investigated the pathogenesis of Blastocystis hominis by
intramuscular injection of the organism into experimental mice. A total of 27
na√Øve BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks were injected in the leg muscle with axenic
culture isolate B of B. hominis. Histological examination at different times
revealed that B. hominis could produce a severe inflammatory reaction and
myonecrosis. Most changes were observed at 6 h after injection and for up to 2-3 
days. By 2 weeks the muscle had regained normal histology. There was infiltration
of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML) into the injection site, indicating that B.
hominis had a strong chemoattractant activity for PML.
