The carotenoid deinoxanthin is a crucial resistance factor against various
stresses in the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. Disruption
of the gene dr2473 encoding the cytochrome P450 CYP287A1 led to the accumulation 
of 2-deoxydeinoxanthin in D. radiodurans, demonstrating that CYP287A1 is a novel 
β-carotene 2-hydroxylase. The dr2473 knockout mutant was shown to be more
sensitive to UV radiation and oxidative stress than the wild-type strain D.
radiodurans R1, indicating that the C2 alcohol of deinoxanthin is important for
antioxidant activity.
