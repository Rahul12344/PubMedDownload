In the case of external ocular diseases such as conjunctivitis,
keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and superficial corneal ulcers, topical
administration of eyedrops containing an antibacterial agent is often prescribed.
Numerous daily instillations of eyedrops over several days are required for
successful treatment, often leading to bad compliance. In addition, the reflex
lachrymation following instillation promotes rapid elimination of the drug from
the corneal surface. To overcome the disadvantage of repeated instillations, a
soluble bioadhesive ophthalmic drug insert (BODI) to be placed in the lower cul
de sac of the eye was developed. The clinical efficacy, after deposition of one
insert and a classical eyedrop treatment (Tiacil), Virbac Laboratories), was
investigated in dogs presenting conjunctivitis, superficial corneal ulcer or
keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). Similar total clinical recovery results were
obtained after 3 and 7 days for both treatments. BODI can therefore
advantageously be prescribed for the treatment of external ophthalmic diseases,
by reducing the treatment to a single application and therefore improving
compliance compared to classical eyedrop treatment.
