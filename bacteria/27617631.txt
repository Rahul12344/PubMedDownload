A stereocontrolled first total synthesis of muraymycin D1 (1) has been achieved. 
The synthetic route is highly stereoselective, featuring (1) selective
β-ribosylation of the C2-methylated amino ribose, (2) selective Strecker
reaction, and (3) ring-opening reaction of a diastereomeric mixture of a
diaminolactone to synthesize muraymycidine (epi-capreomycidine). The
acid-cleavable protecting groups for secondary alcohol and uridine ureido
nitrogen are applied for simultaneous deprotections with the Boc and tBu groups. 
Muraymycin D1 (1) and its amide derivatives (2 and 3) exhibited growth inhibitory
activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC50 = 1.56-6.25 μg/mL) and strong 
enzyme inhibitory activities against the bacterial phosphotransferases (MurX and 
WecA) (IC50 = 0.096-0.69 μM).
