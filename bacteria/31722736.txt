BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an increasingly significant challenge throughout the world 
as one of the major causes of patient morbidity and mortality. Central to the
host immunologic response to sepsis is the increase in circulating
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which have been demonstrated to be
present and independently associated with poor long-term clinical outcomes. MDSCs
are plastic cells and potentially modifiable, particularly through epigenetic
interventions. The objective of this study was to determine how the suppressive
phenotype of MDSCs evolves after sepsis in surgical ICU patients, as well as to
identify epigenetic differences in MDSCs that may explain these changes.
METHODS: Circulating MDSCs from 267 survivors of surgical sepsis were phenotyped 
at various intervals over 6 weeks, and highly enriched MDSCs from 23 of these
samples were co-cultured with CD3/CD28-stimulated autologous T cells. microRNA
expression from enriched MDSCs was also identified.
RESULTS: We observed that MDSC numbers remain significantly elevated in
hospitalized sepsis survivors for at least 6 weeks after their infection.
However, only MDSCs obtained at and beyond 14 days post-sepsis significantly
suppressed T lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production. These same MDSCs
displayed unique epigenetic (miRNA) expression patterns compared to earlier time 
points.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in sepsis survivors, immature myeloid cell numbers 
are increased but the immune suppressive function specific to MDSCs develops over
time, and this is associated with a specific epigenome. These findings may
explain the chronic and persistent immune suppression seen in these subjects.
