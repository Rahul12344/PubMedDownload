To elucidate the reaction mechanism of the ring cleavage of homogentisate by
homogentisate dioxygenase, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)
calculations were carried out by using two systems in different protonation
states of the substrate C2 hydroxyl group. When the substrate C2 hydroxyl group
is ionized (the ionized pathway), the superoxo attack on the substrate is the
rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle, with a barrier of 15.9 kcal/mol.
Glu396 was found to play an important role in stabilizing the bridge species and 
its O-O cleavage product by donating a proton via a hydrogen-bonded water
molecule. When the substrate C2 hydroxyl group is not ionized (the nonionized
pathway), the O-O bond cleavage of the bridge species is the rate-limiting step, 
with a barrier of 15.3 kcal/mol. The QM/MM-optimized geometries for the dioxygen 
and alkylperoxo complexes using the nonionized model (for the C2 hydroxyl group) 
are in agreement with the experimental crystal structures, suggesting that the C2
hydroxyl group is more likely to be nonionized.
