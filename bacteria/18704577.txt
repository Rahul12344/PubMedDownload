TnAraOut is a mariner-based transposon containing an arabinose-inducible promoter
P(BAD) facing outward. TnAraOut mutagenesis previously used to identify essential
genes in Vibrio cholerae can also be used to identify in vitro essential genes in
Salmonella enteritidis. A mutant screen was conducted based on the assumption
that a mutant-harboring TnAraOut insertion in the promoter region of an essential
gene should exhibit arabinose-dependent growth phenotype. Among five isolated
mutants with such growth phenotype, DNA sequencing revealed that two of them have
insertions in the upstream region of atpI and the coding region of yigP gene such
that P(BAD) promoter drives the expression of the downstream gene(s). Growth
assay showed that the growth defects of these two mutants were fully restored by 
arabinose induction.
