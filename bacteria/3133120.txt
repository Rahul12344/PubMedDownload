The expression of MHC class II genes is tightly regulated. One form of congenital
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by a regulatory defect
that precludes expression of HLA class II genes. B lymphocyte cell lines from
such SCID patients provide a tool for identifying putative regulatory proteins
that bind to class II gene promoters. We have identified three proteins binding
to specific segments of the HLA-DRA promoter, two of which interact to form the
predominant DNA-protein complex observed. One of these proteins, defined as an X 
box binding protein (RF-X), is specifically missing in cells from class II
deficient SCID patients. We propose that the molecular defect in this congenital 
HLA class II regulatory deficiency is a lack of RF-X and that this factor plays
an important role in the normal regulation of MHC class II gene expression.
