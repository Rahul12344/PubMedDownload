Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae strains vary considerably in their ability to cause
invasive disease in humans, which is at least in part determined by the capsular 
serotype. Platelets have been implicated as sentinel cells in the circulation for
host defence. One of their utensils for this function is the expression of
Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We here aimed to investigate platelet response to S. 
pneumoniae and a role for TLRs herein. Platelets were stimulated using four
serotypes of S. pneumonia including an unencapsulated mutant strain. In vitro
aggregation and flow cytometry assays were performed using blood of healthy
volunteers, or blood of TLR knock out and WT mice. For in vivo pneumonia
experiments, platelet specific Myd88 knockout (Plt-Myd88-/-) mice were used. We
found that platelet aggregation was induced by unencapsulated S. pneumoniae only.
Whole blood incubation with all S. pneumoniae serotypes tested resulted in
platelet degranulation and platelet-leukocyte complex formation. Platelet
activation was TLR independent, as responses were not inhibited by TLR blocking
antibodies, not induced by TLR agonists and were equally induced in wild-type and
Tlr2-/-, Tlr4-/-, Tlr2/4-/-, Tlr9-/- and Myd88-/- blood. Plt-Myd88-/- and control
mice displayed no differences in bacterial clearance or immune response to
pneumonia by unencapsulated S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, S. pneumoniae activates
platelets through a TLR-independent mechanism that is impeded by the bacterial
capsule. Additionally, platelet MyD88-dependent TLR signalling is not involved in
host defence to unencapsulated S. pneumoniae in vivo.
