The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the prevalence of
Helico-bacter pylori (H. pylori) infection among stable chronic hemodialysis (HD)
patients having non ulcer dyspepsia. The study was carried out on 80 patients
consisting of 40 patients with dyspepsia and 40 consecutive control subjects
without renal disease and dyspepsic symptoms. Mean age of patients were 56 +/- 14
and 47 +/- 15 respectively. This study showed no significant difference of H.
pylori infection between the two groups. Tissue examination of gastric antrum
showed higher localization of H. pylori in HD patients in contrast to controls.
This finding has not been reported before and needs further confirmation and
evaluation for its significance.
