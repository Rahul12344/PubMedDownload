M.I.D.A.S.--an on-line microbiology information system.

Kiehn TE.

The system I have described is the result of several years of study and design. A
special thanks is in order to our many friends who shared thoughts, both good and
bad, about their own systems. Computerization of clinical microbiology
laboratories requires planning that varies considerably from other diagnostic
laboratories. As we develop and update our systems it will be very important for 
us to continue this dialogue. The microbiology Computer Users Group, started by
George E. Buck at Texas, is a good example of this effort.
