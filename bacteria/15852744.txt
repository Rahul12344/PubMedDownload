OBJECTIVE: Immunophenotypic characterization of high grade (pleomorphic) sarcomas
and determination of their frequency, mean/median age, sex preferences and common
sites in Pakistani patients.
METHODS: This study included 134 consecutive cases of high grade (pleomorphic)
sarcomas diagnosed in adults above the age of 15 years in the section of
histopathology at theAga Khan University Hospital, Karachi during a period of two
years. These high grade (pleomorphic) sarcomas were immunophenotyped using a
panel including antibodies against Vimentin, Desmin, Smooth muscle Actin, S 100, 
CD34, CD68 and Cytokeratin etc by indirect immunoperoxidase.
RESULTS: Of the 134 cases which were characterized, 38.1% were pleomorphic
leiomyosarcoma, followed by pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma 14.9%, Malignant
Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumour 9%, pleomorphic liposarcoma 3.7% and pleomorphic
storiform Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma 0.7%. Thirty three percent of cases
could not be characterized further. Mean/ median age for Leiomyosarcoma was
50/50, for Rhabdomyosarcomas 33/22, for MPNST 42/41, for Liposarcoma 52/50 and
for Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma 46/46 respectively. The commonest site for
leiomyosarcoma was lower limb (43%), for rhabdomyosarcoma head and neck (42%),
for MPNSTthorax (36.4%) and for liposarcoma abdomen (50%).
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the most common pleomorphic sarcoma occurring
in our adult population was Leiomyosarcoma, and that immunohistochemical stains
are essential in most cases for further characterization of pleomorphic high
grade sarcoma.
