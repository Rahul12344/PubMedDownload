Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative pathogen in
community-acquired pneumonia. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is expressed
by different cell types in the lungs and can mediate inflammatory responses. We
sought to determine the role of PAR2 during pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal 
pneumonia or sepsis was induced in wild-type and PAR2 knock-out (Par2-/-) mice by
infection with viable S. pneumoniae. Par2-/- mice demonstrated improved host
defense, a largely preserved lung barrier integrity, and reduced mortality during
pneumococcal pneumonia. PAR2 deficiency did not influence bacterial growth after 
intravenous infection. Inhibition of the endogenous PAR2 activating proteases
tissue factor/factor VIIa or tryptase did not impact on bacterial burdens during 
pneumonia. In a PAR2 reporter cell line it was demonstrated that S.
pneumoniae-derived proteases are able to cleave PAR2. These results show that S. 
pneumoniae is able to cleave and exploit PAR2 to disseminate systemically from
the airways.
