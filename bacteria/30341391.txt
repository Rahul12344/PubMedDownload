ADP-glucose is the precursor of glycogen biosynthesis in bacteria, and a compound
abundant in the starchy plant organs ingested by many mammals. Here we show that 
the enteric species Escherichia coli is capable of scavenging exogenous
ADP-glucose for use as a glycosyl donor in glycogen biosynthesis and feed the
adenine nucleotide pool. To unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in this
process, we screened the E. coli single-gene deletion mutants of the Keio
collection for glycogen content in ADP-glucose-containing culture medium. In
comparison to wild-type (WT) cells, individual ∆nupC and ∆nupG mutants lacking
the cAMP/CRP responsive inner-membrane nucleoside transporters NupC and NupG
displayed reduced glycogen contents and slow ADP-glucose incorporation. In
concordance, ∆cya and ∆crp mutants accumulated low levels of glycogen and slowly 
incorporated ADP-glucose. Two-thirds of the glycogen-excess mutants identified
during screening lacked functions that underlie envelope biogenesis and
integrity, including the RpoE specific RseA anti-sigma factor. These mutants
exhibited higher ADP-glucose uptake than WT cells. The incorporation of either
∆crp, ∆nupG or ∆nupC null alleles sharply reduced the ADP-glucose incorporation
and glycogen content initially witnessed in ∆rseA cells. Overall, the data showed
that E. coli incorporates extracellular ADP-glucose through a cAMP/CRP-regulated 
process involving the NupC and NupG nucleoside transporters that is facilitated
under envelope stress conditions.
