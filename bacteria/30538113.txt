Megakaryocyte (MK) migration from the bone marrow periosteal niche toward the
vascular niche is a prerequisite for proplatelet extension and release into the
circulation. The mechanism for this highly coordinated process is poorly
understood. Here we show that dynasore (DNSR), a small-molecule inhibitor of
dynamins (DNMs), or short hairpin RNA knockdown of DNM2 and DNM3 impairs
directional migration in a human MK cell line or MKs derived from cultured CD34+ 
cells. Because cell migration requires actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, we
measured actin polymerization and the activity of cytoskeleton regulator RhoA and
found them to be decreased after inhibition of DNM2 and DNM3. Because SDF-1α is
important for hematopoiesis, we studied the expression of its receptor CXCR4 in
DNSR-treated cells. CXCR4 expression on the cell surface was increased, at least 
partially because of slower endocytosis and internalization after SDF-1α
treatment. Combined inhibition of DNM2 and DNM3 or forced expression of
dominant-negative Dnm2-K44A or GTPase-defective DNM3 diminished β1 integrin
(ITGB1) activity. DNSR-treated MKs showed an abnormally clustered staining
pattern of Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes. This suggests decreased
recruitment of the recycling pathway in DNSR-treated cells. Altogether, we show
that the GTPase activity of DNMs, which governs endocytosis and regulates cell
receptor trafficking, exerts control on MK migration toward SDF-1α gradients,
such as those originating from the vascular niche. DNMs play a critical role in
MKs by triggering membrane-cytoskeleton rearrangements downstream of CXCR4 and
integrins.
