Escherichia coli purB encodes adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL), the enzyme that
catalyzes step 8 in the pathway for de novo synthesis of IMP and also the final
reaction in the two-step sequence from IMP to AMP. Gene purB was cloned and found
to encode an ASL protein of 435 amino acids having a calculated molecular weight 
of 49,225. E. coli ASL is homologous to the corresponding enzymes from Bacillus
subtilis and chickens and also to fumarase from B. subtilis. Gene phoP is 232 bp 
downstream of purB. Gene purB is regulated threefold by the purine pool and purR.
Transcriptional regulation of purB involves binding of the purine repressor to
the 16-bp conserved pur regulon operator. The purB operator is 224 bp downstream 
of the transcription start site and overlaps codons 62 to 67 in the
protein-coding sequence.
