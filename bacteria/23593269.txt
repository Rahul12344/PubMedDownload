The generation of antigen-specific antibodies and the development of
immunological memory require collaboration between B and T cells. T cell-secreted
IL-4 is important for B cell survival, isotype switch to IgG1 and IgE, affinity
maturation, and the development of germinal centers (GC). Fyn, a member of the
Src family tyrosine kinase, is widely expressed in many cell types, including
lymphocytes. This kinase is known to interact with both the B cell and T cell
receptor (BCR and TCR, respectively). While Fyn deletion does not impair the
development of immature T cells and B cells, TCR signaling is altered in mature T
cells. The current study demonstrates that Fyn deficient (KO) B cells have
impaired IL-4 signaling. Fyn KO mice displayed low basal levels of IgG1, IgE and 
IgG2c, and delayed antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2b production, with a dramatic
decrease in antigen-specific IgG2c following immunization with a T-dependent
antigen. Defects in antibody production correlated with significantly reduced
numbers of GC B cells, follicular T helper cells (TFH), and splenic plasma cells 
(PC). Taken together, our data demonstrate that Fyn kinase is required for
optimal humoral responses.
