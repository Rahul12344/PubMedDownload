Lymphocyte migration through gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and into
intestinal effector sites is critical to intestinal immune system function and
homeostasis. Chemokines contribute to lymphocyte trafficking by triggering
integrin activation and firm arrest in the vasculature and mediating chemotactic 
localization within tissues. Several chemokines have been identified that are
expressed in the GALT and/or the intestines themselves (TECK/CCL25, MEC/CCL28,
and MIP-3alpha/CCL20) and play a role in intestinal lymphocyte localization,
including unification of intestinal and other mucosa-associated effector sites;
segmental specialization of the intestines; and subset selective localization to 
the intestines. This review examines the role of these chemokines (and their
receptors CCR9, CCR10, and CCR6, respectively) in lymphocyte homing to the GALT, 
in the induction and differentiation of intestinal effector and memory
lymphocytes, and in the homeostatic and inflammatory localization of lymphocytes 
to the intestines.
