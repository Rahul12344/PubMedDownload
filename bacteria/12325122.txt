Calcineurin is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase that is
conserved in eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, and is the conserved target of the
immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. Genetic studies in yeast
and fungi established the molecular basis of calcineurin inhibition by the
cyclophilin A-CsA and FKBP12-FK506 complexes. Calcineurin also functions in fungi
to control a myriad of physiological processes including cell cycle progression, 
cation homeostasis, and morphogenesis. Recent investigations into the molecular
mechanisms of pathogenesis in Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, two
fungi that cause life-threatening infections in humans, have revealed an
essential role for calcineurin in morphogenesis, virulence, and antifungal drug
action. Novel non-immunosuppressive analogs of the calcineurin inhibitors CsA and
FK506 that retain antifungal activity have been identified and hold promise as
candidate antifungal drugs. In addition, comparisons of calcineurin function in
both fungi and humans may identify fungal-specific components of
calcineurin-signaling pathways that could be targeted for therapy, as well as
conserved elements of calcium signaling events.
