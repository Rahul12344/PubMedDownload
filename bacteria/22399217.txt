OBJECTIVE: To compare the bactericidal properties of povidone-iodine versus
alcohol-based chlorhexidine solution for cleansing the gravid abdomen prior to
amniocentesis.
METHODS: Fifty study participants were recruited from the University of Texas
Women's Clinic in Houston, Texas. Two baseline swabs of the patients' abdomens
were obtained to assess bacterial flora prior to treatment. A 10% povidone-iodine
solution and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate with 70% isopropyl alcohol solution in a 
3-mL prefilled applicator (Chloraprep, Cardinal Health, Inc., Leawood, KS) were
then applied on different sides of the abdomen. After 30 seconds, cultures were
obtained and plated on Trypticase Soy (PML Microbiologicals, Durham, NC) with
sheep's blood agar for aerobic flora. Plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 48 hours 
for aerobic flora. Colony-forming units were counted and recorded.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was detected between baseline
colony counts between the left and right side of each patient's abdomen (p =
0.33) prior to cleansing. Postcleansing colony counts were evaluated, and a
statistically significant difference was identified, favoring chlorhexidine as a 
more efficacious abdominal cleanser (p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that 2% chlorhexidine with 70% isopropyl alcohol had 
excellent bactericidal efficacy and was superior to povidone-iodine for cleansing
the maternal abdomen.
