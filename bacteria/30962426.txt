Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), composed mainly of Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), are strongly implicated in the development of intestinal
inflammation lesions. Its exact etiology and pathogenesis are still undetermined.
Recently accumulating evidence supports that group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3)
are responsible for gastrointestinal mucosal homeostasis through moderate
generation of IL-22, IL-17, and GM-CSF in the physiological state. ILC3
contribute to the progression and aggravation of IBD while both IL-22 and IL-17, 
along with IFN-Î³, are overexpressed by the dysregulation of NCR- ILC3 or NCR+
ILC3 function and the bias of NCR+ ILC3 towards ILC1 as well as regulatory ILC
dysfunction in the pathological state. Herein, we feature the group 3 innate
lymphoid cells' development, biological function, maintenance of gut homeostasis,
mediation of IBD occurrence, and potential application to IBD therapy.
