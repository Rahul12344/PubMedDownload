OBJECTIVES: To investigate the proportion of asymptomatic infection among blood
donors in a region endemic for Leishmania; and to ascertain epidemiological and
genetic factors associated with this condition.
METHODS: We studied 1260 blood donors in the Province of Granada in the Southern 
Spain. After obtaining informed consent in each participant, a poll about habits,
housing and contact with animals were carried out. Blood samples were obtained
for determining antileishmanial antibodies and a PCR assay. HLA typing was
performed in a randomly sample among the donors with positive serology.
RESULTS: We have found that L. infantum antibodies were present in 7.9% of blood 
donors and DNA in blood was detected in 2.5% of donors. There was no concordance 
between both determinations, except in one patient. Taking into consideration
both techniques, 129 participants were considered to have asymptomatic Leishmania
infection. No participant in this study developed clinical leishmaniasis during a
follow-up period of 2 years. HLA were typed in 51 donors. Asymptomatic Leishmania
infection might be associated with certain HLA antigens. A multivariate analysis 
was done with the variables obtained through the participants' interview. The
contact with livestock (goats, pigs, and sheep), but not dogs, either at home or 
in the environment, was significantly and independently associated with
asymptomatic leishmania infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic leishmanial infection among blood donors is frequent in
the Granada Province, south of Spain. The presence of livestock in this region is
related to this infection, perhaps influencing vector density of this disease.
Some HLA genes might be associated with asymptomatic leishmanial state.
