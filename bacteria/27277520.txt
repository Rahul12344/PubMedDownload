Recently, it was proposed that some antibiotics stimulate the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to cell death. Later, other
research groups have provided arguments against ROS-mediated killing of bacteria 
by antibiotics. At present, there remain a number of unanswered questions in
understanding of the role of ROS in killing by antibiotics. Mutants of
Escherichia coli in components of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin redox pathways
used in this study possess a great variability in antioxidant activity, and they 
therefore are a useful model for the investigation of the role of oxidative
stress in bactericidal effect of antibiotics. Statistical analysis did not reveal
a significant correlation between the susceptibility of the mutants to
ciprofloxacin and ampicillin and their resistance to peroxide stress. However, we
found strong reverse correlations between the bactericidal activity of
antibiotics and the specific growth rate of these mutants at the moment of drug
addition. Supplements changing the level of intra- and extracellular glutathione 
considerably affected E. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin. The
effect of GSH precursors on bactericidal activity of antibiotics was also
observed in gshA mutants.
