Infection of cattle with Anaplasma marginale fails to prime sustained
effector/memory T-cell responses, and high bacterial load may induce
antigen-specific CD4 T exhaustion and deletion. We tested the hypothesis that
clearance of persistent infection restores the exhausted T-cell response. We show
that infection-induced T-cell exhaustion, characterized as loss of
antigen-specific proliferation, and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-α) production are partially restored in cattle following
clearance of persistent infection with tetracycline.
