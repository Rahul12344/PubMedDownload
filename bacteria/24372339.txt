BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Altered immune response may be a major contributor to
periodontal disease in Down syndrome. This study investigated the relationship
between peripheral lymphocytes and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in serum in
Down syndrome children with gingivitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children with Down syndrome (n = 10) and healthy controls
(n = 10) were clinically and radiographically examined during dental treatment
under general anaesthesia. Peripheral blood and gingival crevicular fluid were
collected from each subject and concentrations were determined: serum MMP-2, -3, 
-8 and -9; serum tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) -1, -2 and -3;
and gingival crevicular fluid. Leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood and
the relative amounts (%) of the various cell phenotypes were analysed using flow 
cytometry. In addition, peripheral blood cells were treated with Porphyromonas
gingivalis lipopolysaccharide and levels of MMPs and TIMPs measured.
RESULTS: Concentrations of MMP-3, MMP-8 and TIMP-1 in serum were significantly
higher (p < 0.05) in the Down syndrome group compared to the controls. When
peripheral blood leukocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of P.
gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, MMP-8 levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher 
in the Down syndrome group compared to controls. Children with Down syndrome
exhibited significant positive correlations between CD8(+) T cells and MMP-8
(r = 0.630; p = 0.050), between CD8(+) T cells and MMP-9 (r = 0.648; p = 0.043), 
and between CD56(+) NK cells and MMP-3 (r = 0.828; p = 0.003) compared to
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The positive relationship of serum MMP-3, -8 and -9 with immune
cells in children with Down syndrome may facilitate migration of CD8(+) T cells
and CD56(+) NK cells into the periodontal tissue, which may contribute to the
increased degradation of periodontal tissue in individuals with Down syndrome.
