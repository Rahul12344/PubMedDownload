The major histocompatibility complex region has been suggested to play an
important role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). In this
study, we investigated the associations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles 
and amino acid variants of HLA with early-onset AITD. HLA class I and class II
genes were analyzed in 116 Korean children with AITDs (Graves' disease [GD]: 71, 
Hashimoto's disease [HD]: 45) and 142 healthy controls. HLA-B*46:01 (OR = 3.96,
Pc = 0.008), -C*01:02 (OR = 2.51 Pc = 0.04), -DPB1*02:02 (OR = 3.99, Pc = 0.04), 
and -DPB1*05:01 (OR = 4.6, Pc = 0.003) were significantly associated with GD, and
HLA-A*02:07 (OR = 4.68, Pc = 0.045) and -DPB1*02:02 (OR = 6.57, Pc = 0.0001) with
HD. The frequency of HLA-DPB1*05:01 was significantly higher in GD patients than 
in HD patients (Pc = 0.0005). Furthermore, differences were found between
patients with Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and those without TAO in
the distribution of HLA-B*54:01 (8.6% vs. 30.6%, P = 0.04) and -C*03:03 (37.1%
vs. 11.1%, P = 0.02). In the analysis of amino acid variants of HLA molecules,
both Leu35 (OR = 23.38, P = 0.0002) and Glu55 (OR = 23.38, P = 0.0002) of
HLA-DPB1 were strongly associated with GD and showed different distributions
between GD and HD (P = 0.001). Our results suggest that HLA alleles, especially
amino-acid signatures of the HLA-DP Î² chain, might contribute to the molecular
pathogenesis of early-onset AITD.
