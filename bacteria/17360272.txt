The green seaweed Ulva has been shown to detect signal molecules produced by
bacteria. Biofilms that release N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) attract
zoospores--the motile reproductive stages of Ulva. The evidence for AHL
involvement is based on several independent lines of evidence, including the
observation that zoospores are attracted to wild-type bacteria that produce AHLs 
but are not attracted to mutants that do not produce signal molecules. Synthetic 
AHL also attracts zoospores and the attraction is lost in the presence of
autoinducer inactivation (AiiA) protein. The mechanism of attraction is not
chemotactic but involves chemokinesis. When zoospores detect AHLs, the swimming
rate is reduced and this results in accumulation of cells at the source of the
AHL. It has been demonstrated that the detection of AHLs results in calcium
influx into the zoospore. This is the first example of a calcium signalling event
in a eukaryote in response to bacterial quorum sensing molecules. The role of
AHLs in the ecology of Ulva is discussed. It is probable that AHLs act as cues
for the settlement of zoospores, rather than being directly involved as a
signalling mechanism.
