HLA-A is a class I major histocompatibility complex receptor that presents
peptide antigens on the surface of most cells. Vitiligo, an autoimmune disease in
which skin melanocytes are destroyed by cognate T cells, is associated with
variation in the HLA-A gene; specifically HLA-A*02:01, which presents multiple
vitiligo melanocyte autoantigens. Refined genetic mapping localizes vitiligo risk
in the HLA-A region to an SNP haplotype âˆ¼20-kb downstream, spanning an ENCODE
element with many characteristics of a transcriptional enhancer. Convergent CTCF 
insulator sites flanking the HLA-A gene promoter and the predicted
transcriptional regulator, with apparent interaction between these sites,
suggests this element regulates the HLA-A promoter. Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from healthy subjects homozygous for the high-risk haplotype expressed 39% 
more HLA-A RNA than cells from subjects carrying nonhigh-risk haplotypes (P =
0.0048). Similarly, RNAseq analysis of 1,000 Genomes Project data showed more
HLA-A mRNA expressed in subjects homozygous for the high-risk allele of lead SNP 
rs60131261 than subjects homozygous for the low-risk allele (P = 0.006). Reporter
plasmid transfection and genomic run-on sequence analyses confirm that the HLA-A 
transcriptional regulator contains multiple bidirectional promoters, with
greatest activity on the high-risk haplotype, although it does not behave as a
classic enhancer. Vitiligo risk associated with the MHC class I region thus
derives from combined quantitative and qualitative phenomena: a SNP haplotype in 
a transcriptional regulator that induces gain-of-function, elevating expression
of HLA-A RNA in vivo, in strong linkage disequilibrium with an HLA-A allele that 
confers *02:01 specificity.
