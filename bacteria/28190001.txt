Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene encoding the transcriptional regulator 
Ikaros (IKZF1) is a hallmark of BCR-ABL1+ precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (pre-B ALL). However, the mechanisms by which Ikaros functions as a
tumor suppressor in pre-B ALL remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed a mouse
model of BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL together with a new model of inducible expression of
wild-type Ikaros in IKZF1 mutant human BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL. We performed
integrated genome-wide chromatin and expression analyses and identified Ikaros
target genes in mouse and human BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL, revealing novel conserved
gene pathways associated with Ikaros tumor suppressor function. Notably, genetic 
depletion of different Ikaros targets, including CTNND1 and the early
hematopoietic cell surface marker CD34, resulted in reduced leukemic growth. Our 
results suggest that Ikaros mediates tumor suppressor function by enforcing
proper developmental stage-specific expression of multiple genes through
chromatin compaction at its target genes.
