Natural killer T (NKT) cells play an important immunoregulatory role and are
thought to bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses. Following activation 
through cognate interactions with lipid antigen presented in the context of CD1d 
molecules, NKT cells rapidly produce a plethora of cytokines and can also mediate
cytotoxicity. Due to their potent effector functions, extensive research has been
performed to increase our understanding on how to effectively modulate these
cells. In fact, NKT cell agonists have been used as vaccine adjuvants to enhance 
antigen specific T and B cell responses to infections and malignancy. In this
review, we will focus on recent advances in NKT cell-based vaccination
strategies. Given the role that NKT cells play in autoimmune disease, infectious 
diseases, cancer, transplant immunology and dermatology, it is important to
understand how to effectively guide their effector functions in order to develop 
novel immunotherapeutic strategies.
