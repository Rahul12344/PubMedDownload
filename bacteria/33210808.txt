Complement is known to play a role in ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI). A
general paradigm is that complement is activated by self-reactive natural IgM
antibodies (nAbs), after they engage postischemic neoepitopes. However, a role
for nAbs in lung transplantation (LTx) has not been explored. Using mouse models 
of LTx, we investigated the role of two postischemic neoepitopes, modified
annexin IV (B4) and a subset of phospholipids (C2), in LTx. Antibody deficient
Rag1-/- recipient mice were protected from LTx IRI. Reconstitution with either B4
or C2nAb restored IRI, with C2 significantly more effective than B4 nAb. Based on
these information, we developed/characterized a novel complement inhibitor
composed of single-chain antibody (scFv) derived from the C2 nAb linked to Crry
(C2scFv-Crry), a murine inhibitor of C3 activation. Using an allogeneic LTx, in
which recipients contain a full nAb repertoire, C2scFv-Crry targeted to the LTx, 
inhibited IRI, and delayed acute rejection. Finally, we demonstrate the
expression of the C2 neoepitope in human donor lungs, highlighting the
translational potential of this approach.
