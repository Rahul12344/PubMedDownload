tRNAs are the central adaptor molecules in translation. Their decoding properties
are influenced by post-transcriptional modifications, particularly in the
critical anticodon-stem-loop (ASL) region. Synonymous codon choice, also called
codon usage bias, affects both translation efficiency and accuracy, and ASL
modifications play key roles in both of these processes. In combination with a
handful of historical examples, recent studies integrating ribosome profiling,
proteomics, codon-usage analyses, and modification quantifications show that
levels of tRNA modifications can change under stress, during development, or
under specific metabolic conditions and can modulate the expression of specific
genes. Deconvoluting the different responses (global or specific) to tRNA
modification deficiencies can be difficult because of pleiotropic effects, but,
as more cases emerge, it does seem that tRNA modification changes could add
another layer of regulation in the transfer of information from DNA to protein.
