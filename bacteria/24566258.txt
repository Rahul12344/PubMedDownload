An organoleptic assessment of an odor is defined as a method that can measure the
strength of target odors and expresses the value in terms of a point or number
with reference to a pre-defined organoleptic scale. Organoleptic assessments are 
performed using different scales and are used widely in industry (e.g. for
measuring the effectiveness of anti-odor agents), in research (to discover
relationships between bad breath and microbiology of the tongue, or the
generation of particular volatile compounds), but it is also a prerequisite for
the diagnosis of halitosis in individual patients required before directing
appropriate treatment. An organoleptic assessment of halitosis patients may be
carried out in specialized institutions but--based on the fact that in most cases
the odor originates from oral structures--also by dental professionals including 
general dental practitioners (GDPs). Thus, this paper describes the scientific
background for recommendations on how a GDP or dental hygienist or general
practitioner with cases of bad breath should use organoleptic methods as a valid 
approach to assess malodor in patients, with a view to diagnosis and treatment,
and subsequent treatment monitoring.
