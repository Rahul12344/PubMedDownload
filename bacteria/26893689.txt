The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Apelin-13 on
autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and the underlying mechanism of
the effect. The HepG2 cells were treated with Apelin-13 at a final concentration 
of 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 µmol/l for 24 h. Cells were also treated with 10
µmol/l PD98059 for 24 h. The expression of the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and Beclin1 proteins were
detected by western blot analysis. Beclin1 mRNA expression was also detected by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Autophagy was observed using
fluorescence microscopy subsequent to monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining.
Following treatment with the various concentrations of Apelin-13, the expression 
of the ERK1/2 protein remained at a similar level, whereas the expression of
pERK1/2 increased in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the control group,
the increase was significant (P<0.05). Similarly, Beclin1 expression was
upregulated at the protein and mRNA levels by Apelin-13 treatment in a
dose-dependent manner and was significantly increased compared with the control
group. However, following treatment with the Apelin-13 inhibitor PD98059, the
expression of pERK1/2, Beclin1 protein and Beclin1 mRNA were significantly
decreased (P<0.05). In addition, Apelin-13 induced the autophagy of HepG2 cells
in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by MDC staining. PD98059 inhibited
autophagy of HepG2 cells induced by Apelin-13. Therefore, Apelin-13 may promote
autophagy in HepG2 cells by inducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
upregulating the expression of Beclin1.
