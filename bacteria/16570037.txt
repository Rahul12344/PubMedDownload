A male patient, 29 years old, was admitted to our unit with purpura fulminans,
coagulation deficiency, renal failure and subsequent septic shock accompanied by 
respiratory insufficiency in the absence of meningeal signs. The serum levels of 
endogenous protein C, ATIII and calcium were well below the norm. The
bacteriological examination revealed the presence of gram-negative diplococci.
The onset of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) revealed aa early
complication of the meningococcal sepsis. Forty-eight hours after being admitted,
the recombinant protein C infusion was started at a dose of 24 microg/kg/h for
the duration of 96 h. The skin lesions regressed, starting from the ecchymosis
and the edema of the face, trunk and auricular pavilions. A week after the onset 
of the symptomatology the chest X-ray appeared clear, the renal function had
normalised, and the signs of shock had disappeared.
