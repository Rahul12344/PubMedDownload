Depletion of CD4+ T cells during HIV-1 infection is mostly mediated by
inflammatory cells via indirect but not clearly defined mechanisms. In this
report, we used single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) technology to study HIV-induced
transcriptomic change in innate immune cells in lymphoid organs. We performed
scRNA-Seq on hCD45+hCD3-hCD19- human leukocytes isolated from spleens of
humanized NOD/Rag2-/-Î³c-/- (NRG) mice transplanted with human CD34+ hematopoietic
stem progenitor cells (NRG-hu HSC mice). We identified major populations of
innate immune cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), myeloid
dendritic cells (mDCs), macrophages, NK cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). 
HIV-1 infection significantly upregulated genes involved in type I IFN
inflammatory pathways in each of the innate immune subsets. Interestingly, we
found that TRAIL was upregulated in the innate immune populations, including
pDCs, mDCs, macrophages, NK cells, and ILCs. We further demonstrated that
blockade of the TRAIL signaling pathway in NRG-hu HSC mice prevented
HIV-1-induced CD4+ T cell depletion in vivo. In summary, we characterized
HIV-induced transcriptomic changes of innate immune cells in the spleen at
single-cell levels, identified the TRAIL+ innate immune cells, and defined an
important role of the TRAIL signaling pathway in HIV-1-induced CD4+ T cell
depletion in vivo.
