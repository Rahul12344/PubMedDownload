The genes in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens that encode the enzymes involved in
butyrate production were sequenced. In a type I strain (ATCC 19171(T)), the genes
coding for the enzymes that catalyze the conversion from acetyl-CoA to
butyryl-CoA, thl (thiolase), crt (crotonase), hbd (beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase), bcd (butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), etfB (electron transfer
flavoprotein [ETF]-beta), and etfA (ETF-alpha), were found to be clustered and
arranged in this order. A type II strain (ATCC 51255) had the same clustered
genes with the same arrangement, except that crt was not present in the clustered
genes. The deduced amino acid sequences of these enzymes did not greatly differ
between the two strains, and even between B. fibrisolvens and clostridia. Amino
acid identity appeared to be higher within the same type than between types I and
II. The clustered genes were shown to be cotranscribed, and constitutively
transcribed without being affected significantly by culture conditions.
