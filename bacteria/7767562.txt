Airway surface liquid (ASL) is complex and comes from many sources, in particular
glands and epithelium. The mucoglycoproteins present bind to bacteria. Bacterial 
membranes contain adhesins that bind to receptors on the mucus. The bound
bacteria multiply and release toxins that diffuse to the epithelium and damage or
destroy it, inhibiting mucociliary transport. The damaged epithelium releases
products such as phospholipids into the ASL. These change the physical properties
of the mucus and also promote mucus secretion, which may block smaller airways.
Airway surface liquid contains constituents such as immunoglobulins, lysozyme,
and lactoferrin and neutrophil products such as proteases that act on bacteria.
Few bacteria adhere to healthy epithelium. To adhere, most require damaged tissue
with membrane receptors that encourage bacterial invasion. If the epithelium is
destroyed, bacteria adhere to the basement membrane or extracellular matrix. A
damaged epithelium can also cause hyperresponsiveness of airway secretory
mechanisms, with increased gland secretion that in turn interacts with the
bacteria.
