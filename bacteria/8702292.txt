Natural transformation was demonstrated in unenclosed experiments incubated in
river epilithon. Strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were transformed to
prototrophy by either free DNA (lysates) or live donor cells. The sources of
transforming DNA and recipient culture were immobilized on filters, secured to
stones, and incubated midstream in the river. The transfer frequency generally
increased with temperature. No transfer was detected in the river Taff below 10
degrees C. The age of the recipient culture affected the transformation
frequencies in situ but did not significantly affect the transfer frequency on
laboratory media. Transformation of recipient cultures which had been
incorporated into the natural epilithic biofilm and transformation of the plasmid
pQM17 in situ were also demonstrated. This study provides the first direct
evidence of natural transformation in situ of bacteria incorporated into an
indigenous community.
