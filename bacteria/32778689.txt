Class II terpene cyclases, such as oxidosqualene and squalene-hopene cyclases,
catalyse some of the most complex polycyclization reactions. They minimally
exhibit a β,γ-didomain architecture that has been evolutionarily repurposed in a 
wide range of terpene-processing enzymes and likely resulted from a fusion of
unidentified monodomain proteins. Although single domain class I terpene cyclases
have already been identified, the corresponding class II counterparts have not
been previously reported. Here we present high-resolution X-ray structures of a
monodomain class II cyclase, merosterolic acid synthase (MstE). With a
minimalistic β-domain architecture, this cyanobacterial enzyme is able to
construct four rings in cytotoxic meroterpenoids with a sterol-like topology. The
structures with bound substrate, product, and inhibitor provide detailed
snapshots of a cyclization mechanism largely governed by residues located in a
noncanonical enzyme region. Our results complement the few known class II cyclase
crystal structures, while also indicating that archaic monodomain cyclases might 
have already catalyzed complex reaction cascades.
