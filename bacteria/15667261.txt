All eukaryotes seem to possess proteins that most probably evolved from an
ancestral Fe-hydrogenase. These proteins, known as NARF or Nar, do not produce
hydrogen. Notably, a small group of rather unrelated unicellular anaerobes and a 
few algae possess Fe-hydrogenases, which produce hydrogen. In most, but not all
organisms, hydrogen production occurs in membrane-bounded organelles, i.e.
hydrogenosomes or plastids. Whereas plastids are monophyletic, hydrogenosomes
evolved repeatedly and independently from mitochondria or mitochondria-like
organelles. A systematic analysis of the various hydrogenosomes and their
hydrogenases will contribute to an understanding of the evolution of the
eukaryotic cell, and provide clues to the evolutionary origin(s) of the
Fe-hydrogenase.
