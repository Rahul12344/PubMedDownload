The design of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for biological applications, 
operating at ambient pressure, is described. The STM is combined with an
"auxiliary" light microscope to facilitate finding and identifying specimen areas
of interest. The performance of the STM has been tested with evaporated gold
films and with graphite. We have evaluated evaporated carbon and platinum/carbon 
films deposited on glass or mica to be used as specimen supports. First
applications to biological material coated with a conducting film of
platinum/carbon are described.
