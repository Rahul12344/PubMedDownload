Type IVa pili are protein filaments essential for virulence in many bacterial
pathogens; they extend and retract from the surface of bacterial cells to pull
the bacteria forward. The motor ATPase PilB powers pilus assembly. Here we report
the structures of the core ATPase domains of Geobacter metallireducens PilB bound
to ADP and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, at 3.4 and 2.3 Å
resolution, respectively. These structures reveal important differences in
nucleotide binding between chains. Analysis of these differences reveals the
sequential turnover of nucleotide, and the corresponding domain movements. Our
data suggest a clockwise rotation of the central sub-pores of PilB, which through
interactions with PilC, would support the assembly of a right-handed helical
pilus. Our analysis also suggests a counterclockwise rotation of the C2 symmetric
PilT that would enable right-handed pilus disassembly. The proposed model
provides insight into how this family of ATPases can power pilus extension and
retraction.
