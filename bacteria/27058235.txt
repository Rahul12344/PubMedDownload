Salmonella Typhimurium stimulates inflammatory responses in the intestinal
epithelium, which are essential for its ability to replicate within the
intestinal tract. Stimulation of these responses is strictly dependent on the
activity of a type III secretion system encoded within its pathogenicity island
1, which through the delivery of effector proteins, triggers signaling pathways
leading to inflammation. One of these effectors is SopA, a HECT-type E3 ligase,
which is required for the efficient stimulation of inflammation in an animal
model of Salmonella Typhimurium infection. We show here that SopA contributes to 
the stimulation of innate immune responses by targeting two host E3 ubiquitin
ligases, TRIM56 and TRIM65. We also found that TRIM65 interacts with the innate
immune receptor MDA5 enhancing its ability to stimulate interferon-β signaling.
Therefore, by targeting TRIM56 and TRIM65, SopA can stimulate signaling through
two innate immune receptors, RIG-I and MDA5. These findings describe a Salmonella
mechanism to modulate inflammatory responses by directly targeting innate immune 
signaling mechanisms.
