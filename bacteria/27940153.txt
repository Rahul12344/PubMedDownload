BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial translation machinery solely exists for the synthesis
of 13 mitochondrially-encoded subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) 
complexes in mammals. Therefore, it plays a critical role in mitochondrial energy
production. However, regulation of the mitochondrial translation machinery is
still poorly understood. In comprehensive proteomics studies with normal and
diseased tissues and cell lines, we and others have found the majority of
mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) to be phosphorylated. Neither the kinases
for these phosphorylation events nor their specific roles in mitochondrial
translation are known.
METHODS: Mitochondrial kinases are responsible for phosphorylation of MRPs
enriched from bovine mitoplasts by strong cation-exchange chromatography and
identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses of kinase rich
fractions. Phosphorylation of recombinant MRPs and 55S ribosomes was assessed by 
in vitro phosphorylation assays using the kinase-rich fractions. The effect of
identified kinase on OXPHOS and mitochondrial translation was assessed by various
cell biological and immunoblotting approaches.
RESULTS: Here, we provide the first evidence for the association of Fyn kinase, a
Src family kinase, with mitochondrial translation components and its involvement 
in phosphorylation of 55S ribosomal proteins in vitro. Modulation of Fyn
expression in human cell lines has provided a link between mitochondrial
translation and energy metabolism, which was evident by the changes in 13
mitochondrially encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes.
CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that Fyn kinase is
part of a complex mechanism that regulates protein synthesis and OXPHOS possibly 
by tyrosine phosphorylation of translation components in mammalian mitochondria.
