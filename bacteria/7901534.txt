During summer 1991 an outbreak of louse-borne relapsing fever occurred
simultaneously in two transit camps established for prisoners of war being
returned from Eritrea at the end of the Ethiopian civil war. Only antibiotic
treatment was given at the Bahr Dar camp where the frequency of cases increased
for 20 days. Vector control by delousing in addition to antibiotics was given at 
Mekele camp where the frequency of cases fell over a similar period. This
difference was significant (p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant
correlation between the decreasing proportion of camp inhabitants that had not
been deloused at Mekele camp each day and the numbers of patients with fever (r =
0.89, p < 0.001). Taken together, these results confirm that effective control of
an epidemic of louse-borne relapsing fever is dependent on efficient vector
control in addition to antibiotic treatment.
