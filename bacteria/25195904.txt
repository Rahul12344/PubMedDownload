RsmI and RsmH are AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases that are responsible for
the 2'-O-methylation and N(4)-methylation of C1402 of Escherichia coli 16S rRNA, 
respectively. Modification of this site has been found to play a role in
fine-tuning the shape and function of the P-site to increase the decoding
fidelity. It is interesting to study the mechanism by which C1402 can be
methylated by both RsmI and RsmH. The crystal structure of RsmH in complex with
AdoMet and cytidine has recently been determined and provided some implications
for N(4)-methylation of this site. Here, the purification and crystallization of 
RsmI as well as its preliminary crystallographic analysis are reported.
Co-crystallization of RsmI with AdoMet was carried out by the sitting-drop
vapour-diffusion method and X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.60 Å
resolution on beamline 1W2B at BSRF. The crystal contained three molecules per
asymmetric unit and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
121.9, b = 152.5, c = 54.2 Å, β = 93.4°.
