The study of early T-cell development in humans is challenging because of limited
availability of thymic samples and the limitations of in vitro T-cell
differentiation assays. We used an artificial thymic organoid (ATO) platform
generated by aggregating a DLL4-expressing stromal cell line (MS5-hDLL4) with
CD34+ cells isolated from bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood to study
T-cell development from CD34+ cells of patients carrying hematopoietic intrinsic 
or thymic defects that cause T-cell lymphopenia. We found that AK2 deficiency is 
associated with decreased cell viability and an early block in T-cell
development. We observed a similar defect in a patient carrying a null IL2RG
mutation. In contrast, CD34+ cells from a patient carrying a missense IL2RG
mutation reached full T-cell maturation, although cell numbers were significantly
lower than in controls. CD34+ cells from patients carrying RAG mutations were
able to differentiate to CD4+CD8+ cells, but not to CD3+TCRαβ+ cells. Finally,
normal T-cell differentiation was observed in a patient with complete DiGeorge
syndrome, consistent with the extra-hematopoietic nature of the defect. The ATO
system may help determine whether T-cell deficiency reflects hematopoietic or
thymic intrinsic abnormalities and define the exact stage at which T-cell
differentiation is blocked.
