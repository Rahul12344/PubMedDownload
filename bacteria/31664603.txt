BACKGROUND: Advanced age is associated with increased mortality in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Preclinical studies suggest that
the host response to an injurious challenge is age-dependent. In ARDS patients,
we investigated whether the association between age and mortality is mediated
through age-related differences in the host response.
METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study,
performed in the ICUs of two university-affiliated hospitals. The systemic host
response was characterized in three predefined age-groups, based on the
age-tertiles of the studied population: young (18 to 54 years, N = 209),
middle-aged (55 to 67 years, N = 213), and elderly (67 years and older, N = 196).
Biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial activation, and coagulation were
determined in plasma obtained at the onset of ARDS. The primary outcome was
90-day mortality. A mediation analysis was performed to examine whether
age-related differences in biomarker levels serve as potential causal pathways
mediating the association between age and mortality.
RESULTS: Ninety-day mortality rates were 30% (63/209) in young, 37% (78/213) in
middle-aged, and 43% (84/196) in elderly patients. Middle-aged and elderly
patients had a higher risk of death compared to young patients (adjusted odds
ratio, 1.5 [95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.3] and 2.1 [1.4 to 3.4],
respectively). Relative to young patients, the elderly had significantly lower
systemic levels of biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation. Tissue 
plasminogen activator, a marker of coagulation, was the only biomarker that
showed partial mediation (proportion of mediation, 10 [1 to 28] %).
CONCLUSION: Little evidence was found that the association between age and
mortality in ARDS patients is mediated through age-dependent differences in host 
response pathways. Only tissue plasminogen activator was identified as a possible
mediator of interest.
