Legionella pneumophila, the Gram-negative pathogen causing Legionnaires' disease,
infects host cells by hijacking endocytic pathways and forming a
Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) in which the bacteria replicate. To promote
LCV expansion and prevent lysosomal targeting, effector proteins are translocated
into the host cell where they alter membrane traffic. Here we show that three of 
these effectors [LegC2 (Legionella eukaryotic-like gene C2)/YlfB (yeast lethal
factor B), LegC3, and LegC7/YlfA] functionally mimic glutamine (Q)-SNARE
proteins. In infected cells, the three proteins selectively form complexes with
the endosomal arginine (R)-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4).
When reconstituted in proteoliposomes, these proteins avidly fuse with liposomes 
containing VAMP4, resulting in a stable complex with properties resembling
canonical SNARE complexes. Intriguingly, however, the LegC/SNARE hybrid complex
cannot be disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. We conclude that
LegCs use SNARE mimicry to divert VAMP4-containing vesicles for fusion with the
LCV, thus promoting its expansion. In addition, the LegC/VAMP4 complex avoids the
host's disassembly machinery, thus effectively trapping VAMP4 in an inactive
state.
