S100A13 is involved in several key biological functions like angiogenesis, tumor 
formation and cell apoptosis. It is a homodimeric protein that belongs to the
S100 protein family. S100A13 is co-expressed with acidic fibroblast growth factor
(FGF1) and interleukin-1α which are key angiogenesis inducers. The S100 proteins 
have been shown to be involved in several cellular functions such as calcium
homeostasis, cell growth and differentiation dynamic of cytoskeleton. Its
biological functions are mainly mediated through the receptor for advanced
glycation end products (RAGE) signaling. RAGE is involved in inflammatory
processes and is associated with diabetic complications, tumor outgrowth, and
neurodegenerative disorders. RAGE induces cellular signaling upon binding of
different ligands, such as S100 proteins, glycated proteins, and HMGB1. RAGE
signaling is complex, and it depends on the cell type and concentration of the
ligand. Molecular level interactions of RAGE and S100 proteins are useful to
understand the RAGE signaling diversity. In this report we focus on the molecular
level interactions of S100A13 and RAGE C2 domain. The binding between RAGE C2 and
S100A13 is moderately strong (Kd~1.3μM). We have solved the solution structure of
the S100A13-RAGE C2 complex and pronounce the interface regions in S100A13-RAGE
C2 complex which are helpful for drug development of RAGE induced diseases.
