We examined chaperone association with subtypes of HLA-A68 differing at positions
116 and/or 70, and analyzed the surface expression of each A68 subtype. Our
findings with A68 indicate that certain subtypes have inefficient association
with the assembly complex and correspondingly high surface expression, dependent 
on the character of position 116. Specifically, poor association of A68 subtypes 
with the transporter associated with antigen processing correlated with a
comparatively high level of W6/32(+) forms at the cell surface. This observation 
suggests that intracellular retention is a dominant function of the assembly
complex and that natural differences in assembly complex interaction may dictate 
the level of surface expression of MHC class I molecules. We also found that
position 116 was crucial for HLA-A68 subtype association with the assembly
complex. Our data contrast with results we obtained previously with HLA-B7 in
that an aspartic acid at position 116 abrogated chaperone association for
HLA-A68, whereas it increased association for HLA-B7. In total, HLA-A molecules
exhibit natural allele-specific distinctions in chaperone association that
correlate with differences in cell surface expression and with the identity of
amino acid position 116.
