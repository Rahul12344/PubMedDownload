Dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) that liberate dipeptides from the N-terminal end of 
oligopeptides are crucial for the growth of Porphyromonas species, anaerobic
asaccharolytic gram negative rods that utilize amino acids as energy sources.
Porphyromonas endodontalis is a causative agent of periapical lesions with acute 
symptoms and Asp/Glu-specific DPP11 has been solely characterized in this
organism. In this study, we identified and characterized two P. endodontalis
DPPs, DPP5 and DPP7. Cell-associated DPP activity toward
Lys-Ala-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) was prominent in P. endodontalis ATCC
35406 as compared with the Porphyromonas gingivalis strains ATCC 33277, 16-1,
HW24D1, ATCC 49417, W83, W50, and HNA99. The level of hydrolysis of Leu-Asp-MCA
by DPP11, Gly-Pro-MCA by DPP4, and Met-Leu-MCA was also higher than in the P.
gingivalis strains. MER236725 and MER278904 are P. endodontalis proteins belong
to the S9- and S46-family peptidases, respectively. Recombinant MER236725
exhibited enzymatic properties including substrate specificity, and salt- and
pH-dependence similar to P. gingivalis DPP5 belonging to the S9 family. However, 
the kcat/Km figure (194 µM-1·sec-1) for the most potent substrate (Lys-Ala-MCA)
was 18.4-fold higher as compared to the P. gingivalis entity (10.5 µM-1·sec-1).
In addition, P. endodontalis DPP5 mRNA and protein contents were increased
several fold as compared with those in P. gingivalis. Recombinant MER278904
preferentially hydrolyzed Met-Leu-MCA and exhibited a substrate specificity
similar to P. gingivalis DPP7 belonging to the S46 family. In accord with the
deduced molecular mass of 818 amino acids, a 105-kDa band was immunologically
detected, indicating that P. endodontalis DPP7 is an exceptionally large molecule
in the DPP7/DPP11/S46 peptidase family. The enhancement of four DPP activities
was conclusively demonstrated in P. endodontalis, and remarkable
Lys-Ala-MCA-hydrolysis was achieved by qualitative and quantitative potentiation 
of the DPP5 molecule.
