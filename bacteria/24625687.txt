BACKGROUND: This pilot study investigated changes in remyelinating and
demyelinating activity in normal appearing brain tissue (NABT) and lesions, by
using voxel-wise magnetization transfer ratio (VW-MTR), in patients with
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) receiving interferon beta-1a 44 mcg
subcutaneously (IFN β-1a SC) three times weekly versus healthy controls (HCs)
(NCT01085318).
METHODS: Increasing (suggestive of remyelination) and decreasing (suggestive of
demyelination) VW-MTR changes in NABT and in T2, T1 and gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing
lesion volume were measured over 24 weeks in 23 patients treated with IFN β-1a SC
and in 15 HCs (where applicable). VW-MTR changes were tested using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
RESULTS: A trend for greater volume of NABT with increasing VW-MTR at 24 weeks
was observed for patients versus HCs (median [range] 1206 [0-15278]; 342 [0-951] 
mm3; p = 0.061). NABT volume with increasing VW-MTR at 12 weeks was significantly
greater in patients than in HCs (852 [6-11577]; 360 [0-1755] mm3; p = 0.028).
Similar findings were detected for lesion volumes. Two patients with notably high
numbers of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline had a markedly greater volume of
tissue with increasing VW-MTR compared with other patients. Volume of NABT tissue
with decreasing VW-MTR was significantly greater in patients versus HCs at 24
weeks (942 [0-6141]; 297 [0-852] mm3; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The significant change in NABT volume with increasing VW-MTR at 12
weeks suggests that active remyelination in patients with RRMS may occur during
treatment with IFN β-1a SC. Findings from two patients with the highest number of
Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline suggest that extensive remyelination in NABT may
occur in patients with high disease activity. Tissue volume with decreasing
VW-MTR was greater in patients than in HCs, despite treatment, validating the
sensitivity of this technique for detecting MS disease activity.
