PURPOSE: Circulating adipose stromal cells (CASC) are thought to be increased in 
obesity and facilitate angiogenesis, and tumor metastases.
METHODS: CASC were identified from buffy coat peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) by flow cytometry as CD34brightCD31- CD45- and CASC frequency was
compared to adiposity measures in 33 women at increased risk for breast cancer.
Feasibility of CASC as a response biomarker for a diet and exercise intervention 
in ten breast cancer survivors was then explored.
RESULTS: For 33 high-risk women, median CASC frequency was 9.7 per million PBMCs 
and trended positively with body mass index, fat mass index (FMI), and percent
android fat. Correlation was significant when BMI was dichotomized at
> versus < 35 kg/m2 (p = 0.02). For ten breast cancer survivors with a median BMI
of 37 kg/m2, median CASC frequency was 16.4 per million PBMCs. In univariate
analyses, change in BMI, total fat and visceral fat were significantly correlated
with change in CASC frequency. On multivariate analysis, change in visceral
adipose had the strongest association with change in CASC frequency
(p < 0.00078).
CONCLUSIONS: The association between the reduction in visceral adipose tissue and
the decrease in frequency of circulating adipose stromal cells suggests that the 
latter might be a useful biomarker in clinical trials of obese breast cancer
survivors undergoing a weight loss intervention.
