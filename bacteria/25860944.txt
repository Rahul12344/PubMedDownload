Lichens are valuable natural resources used for centuries throughout the world as
medicine, food, fodder, perfume, spices and dyes, as well as for other
miscellaneous purposes. This study investigates the antiproliferative,
antibacterial and antifungal activity of the acetone extract of the lichen
Xanthoria parietina (Linnaeus) Theodor Fries and its major secondary metabolite, 
parietin. The extract and parietin were tested for antimicrobial activity against
nine American Type Culture Collection standard and clinically isolated bacterial 
strains, and three fungal strains. Both showed strong antibacterial activity
against all bacterial strains and matched clinical isolates, particularly against
Staphylococcus aureus from standard and clinical sources. Among the fungi tested,
Rhizoctonia solani was the most sensitive. The antiproliferative effects of the
extract and parietin were also investigated in human breast cancer cells. The
extract inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis, both effects being
accompanied by modulation of expression of cell cycle regulating genes such as
p16, p27, cyclin D1 and cyclin A. It also mediated apoptosis by activating
extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways, modulating Tumor Necrosis
Factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),
and inducing Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) phosphorylation. Our
results indicate that Xanthoria parietina is a major potential source of
antimicrobial and anticancer substances.
