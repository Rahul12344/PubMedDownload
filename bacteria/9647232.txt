TCR down-regulation plays an important role in modulating T cell responses both
during T cell development and in mature T cells. Down-regulation of the TCR is
induced by engagement of the TCR by specific ligands and/or by activation of
protein kinase C (PKC). We report here that ligand- and PKC-induced TCR
down-regulation is mediated by two distinct, independent mechanisms.
Ligand-induced TCR down-regulation is dependent on the protein tyrosine kinases
p56(lck) and p59(fyn) but independent of PKC and the CD3gamma leucine-based
(L-based) internalization motif. In contrast, PKC-induced TCR down-regulation is 
dependent on the CD3gamma L-based internalization motif but independent of
p56(lck) and p59(fyn). Finally, our data indicate that in the absence of TCR
ligation, TCR expression levels can be finely regulated via the CD3gamma L-based 
motif by the balance between PKC and serine/threonine protein phosphatase
activities. Such a TCR ligation-independent regulation of TCR expression levels
could probably be important in determining the activation threshold of T cells in
their encounter with APC.
