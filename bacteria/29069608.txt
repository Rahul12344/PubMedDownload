The TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling pathway plays critical roles in multiple
biological processes. Extensive studies have explored the mechanisms regulating
this signaling cascade, and identified an E2 complex, Uev1A-Ubc13, that mediates 
K63-linked poly-Ub chain formation and thus recruits NEMO to activate the
signaling transduction. In this study, we demonstrate that the Uev1A-Ubc13
complex simultaneously serves as a repressor of the NF-κB pathway. It was found
that cells overexpressing UEV1A silence the signal cascade earlier than control
cells. Importantly, UEV1A overexpression enhances TACE maturation to shed the
TNFα receptor. The Uev1A-Ubc13 complex interacts with RHBDF2, a key factor
promoting TACE maturation, and inhibition of the Uev1A-Ubc13 activity interferes 
with RHBDF2-promoted TACE maturation. Furthermore, upon TNFα stimulation, the
Uev1A-Ubc13 complex cooperates with CHIP to promote K63-linked ubiquitination of 
RHBDF2, enhancing its activity toward TACE maturation and subsequently blocking
TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling.
