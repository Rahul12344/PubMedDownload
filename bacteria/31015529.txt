The CRISPR-Cas9 system has raised hopes for developing personalized gene
therapies for complex diseases. Its application for genetic and epigenetic
therapies in humans raises concerns over immunogenicity of the bacterially
derived Cas9 protein. Here we detect antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9
(SpCas9) in at least 5% of 143 healthy individuals. We also report pre-existing
human CD8+T cell immunity in the majority of healthy individuals screened. We
identify two immunodominant SpCas9 T cell epitopes for HLA-A*02:01 using an
enhanced prediction algorithm that incorporates T cell receptor contact residue
hydrophobicity and HLA binding and evaluated them by T cell assays using healthy 
donor PBMCs. In a proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate that Cas9 protein can 
be modified to eliminate immunodominant epitopes through targeted mutation while 
preserving its function and specificity. Our study highlights the problem of
pre-existing immunity against CRISPR-associated nucleases and offers a potential 
solution to mitigate the T cell immune response.
