Seven gene loci of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were analyzed as potential 
epidemiological typing markers to aid in the investigation of legionella
outbreaks. The genes chosen included four likely to be selectively neutral (acn, 
groES, groEL, and recA) and three likely to be under selective pressure (flaA,
mompS, and proA). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify 279- to 763-bp
fragments from each gene. Initial sequence analysis of the seven loci from 10
well-characterized isolates of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 gave excellent
reproducibility (R) and epidemiological concordance (E) values (R = 1.00; E =
1.00). The three loci showing greatest discrimination and nucleotide variation,
flaA, mompS, and proA, were chosen for further study. Indices of discrimination
(D) were calculated using a panel of 79 unrelated isolates. Single loci gave D
values ranging from 0.767 to 0.857, and a combination of all three loci resulted 
in a D value of 0.924. When all three loci were combined with monoclonal antibody
subgrouping, the D value was 0.971. Sequence-based typing of L. pneumophila
serogroup 1 using only three loci is epidemiologically concordant and highly
discriminatory and has the potential to become the new "gold standard" for the
epidemiological typing of L. pneumophila.
