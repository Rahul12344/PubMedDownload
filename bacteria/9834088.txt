Staphylococcus enterotoxin superantigens are potent T cell activators. To gain
new insights into the mechanism of T cell activation induced by these
superantigens, we investigated the recruitment of signaling molecules in this
process. Here, we show that enterotoxin superantigen activation can be
transmitted to TCR-CD3 complexes that did not interact with their ligand. Indeed,
by studying cells expressing two distinct TCRs, we found that enterotoxin
superantigens induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TCRzeta subunits, the
recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70,
and an increase in protein tyrosine kinase activity of both directly stimulated
and unstimulated TCR-CD3 complexes. As the involvement of unstimulated TCR-CD3
complexes in signal transduction would increase the number of signaling molecules
and, therefore, the efficiency of T cell activation, these data provide a novel
explanation for the ability of enterotoxin superantigens to potently activate T
lymphocytes.
