The oral mucosa exhibits unique regenerative properties, sometimes referred to as
foetal-like wound healing. Researchers from our institute have used sheets of
oral mucosa epithelial cells (OMECs) for regenerative medicine applications
including cornea replacement and oesophageal epithelial regeneration for
stricture prevention. Here, we have isolated exosomes from clinical-grade
production of OMEC sheets from healthy human donors (n = 8), aiming to evaluate
the clinical potential of the exosomes to stimulate epithelial regeneration and
to improve understanding of the mode-of-action of the cells. Exosomes were
isolated from conditioned (cExo) and non-conditioned (ncExo) media.
Characterization was performed using Western blot for common exosomal-markers:
CD9 and flotillin were positive while annexin V, EpCam and contaminating marker
GRP94 were negative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed a diameter of
~120 nm and transmission electron microscopy showed a corresponding size and
spherical appearance. Human skin fibroblasts exposed to exosomes showed
dose-dependent reduction of proliferation and a considerable increase of growth
factor gene expression (HGF, VEGFA, FGF2 and CTGF). The results were similar for 
both groups, but with a trend towards a larger effect from cExo. To study
adhesion, fluorescently labelled exosomes were topically applied to pig
oesophageal wound-beds ex vivo and subsequently washed. Positive signal could be 
detected after as little as 1 min of adhesion, but increased adhesion time
produced a stronger signal. Next, labelled exosomes were added to full-thickness 
skin wounds in rats and signal was detected up to 5 days after application. cExo 
significantly reduced the wound size at days 6 and 17. In conclusion, exosomes
from OMEC sheets showed pro-regenerative effects on skin wound healing. This is
the first time that the healing capacity of the oral mucosa is studied from an
exosome perspective. These findings might lead to a combinational therapy of cell
sheets and exosomes for future patients with early oesophageal cancer.
