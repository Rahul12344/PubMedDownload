We present a case of a 46-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history
significant for uncontrolled diabetes presenting with abdominal pain, nausea and 
vomiting and found to have Lactobacillus bacteremia and liver abscess. A PubMed
and Clinical Key literature review of the other known cases of Lactobacillus
liver abscess was performed. Through examination of previous case reports, the
patient presented in this paper, and the associated risk factors of Lactobacillus
liver abscess it is likely that the incidence of this rare condition will
increase and would therefore be prudent to further study Lactobacillus as a
pathogenic bacteria so that its complications may be better treated and
prevented.
