Translational control of gene expression plays a key role during the early phases
of embryonic development. Here we describe a transcriptional regulator of mouse
embryonic stem cells (mESCs), Yin-yang 2 (YY2), that is controlled by the
translation inhibitors, Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins
(4E-BPs). YY2 plays a critical role in regulating mESC functions through control 
of key pluripotency factors, including Octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct4) and
Estrogen-related receptor-β (Esrrb). Importantly, overexpression of YY2 directs
the differentiation of mESCs into cardiovascular lineages. We show that the
splicing regulator Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) promotes the
retention of an intron in the 5'-UTR of Yy2 mRNA that confers sensitivity to
4E-BP-mediated translational suppression. Thus, we conclude that YY2 is a major
regulator of mESC self-renewal and lineage commitment and document a multilayer
regulatory mechanism that controls its expression.
