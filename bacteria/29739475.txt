OBJECTIVEWe report the utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) conducted in a
clinically relevant time frame (ie, sufficient for guiding management decision), 
in managing a Streptococcus pyogenes outbreak, and present a comparison of its
performance with emm typing.SETTINGA 2,000-bed tertiary-care psychiatric
hospital.METHODSActive surveillance was conducted to identify new cases of S.
pyogenes. WGS guided targeted epidemiological investigations, and infection
control measures were implemented. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based
genome phylogeny, emm typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were
performed. We compared the ability of WGS and emm typing to correctly identify
person-to-person transmission and to guide the management of the
outbreak.RESULTSThe study included 204 patients and 152 staff. We identified 35
patients and 2 staff members with S. pyogenes. WGS revealed polyclonal S.
pyogenes infections with 3 genetically distinct phylogenetic clusters (C1-C3).
Cluster C1 isolates were all emm type 4, sequence type 915 and had pairwise SNP
differences of 0-5, which suggested recent person-to-person transmissions.
Epidemiological investigation revealed that cluster C1 was mediated by dermal
colonization and transmission of S. pyogenes in a male residential ward. Clusters
C2 and C3 were genomically diverse, with pairwise SNP differences of 21-45 and
26-58, and emm 11 and mostly emm120, respectively. Clusters C2 and C3, which may 
have been considered person-to-person transmissions by emm typing, were shown by 
WGS to be unlikely by integrating pairwise SNP differences with
epidemiology.CONCLUSIONSWGS had higher resolution than emm typing in identifying 
clusters with recent and ongoing person-to-person transmissions, which allowed
implementation of targeted intervention to control the outbreak.Infect Control
