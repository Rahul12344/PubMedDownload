BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug that is also currently used 
in transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma. Previous studies have
suggested a negative impact of lenalidomide on the mobilization of CD34+ cells.
No data are available regarding the more detailed composition of blood grafts
after lenalidomide.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, prospective study, we analyzed the
mobilization of CD34+ cells, graft cellular composition, and post-transplant
hematologic recovery in 26 patients with multiple myeloma after
lenalidomide-based induction and in 34 lenalidomide-naive controls with multiple 
myeloma. All patients were mobilized with low-dose cyclophosphamide plus
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. The cellular composition of the grafts was
analyzed from thawed, cryopreserved samples with flow cytometry. Graft function
was evaluated by engraftment data and by complete blood counts until 12 months
after the graft infusion.
RESULTS: Patients in the lenalidomide arm had lower median peak CD34+ counts and 
approximately 40% lower CD34+ cell yields from the first apheresis session, but
these differences were not significant. The median total number of CD34+ cells
collected was comparable (6.4 vs. 7.5 × 106 /kg). The number of apheresis
sessions was higher in the lenalidomide group (2 vs. 1; p = 0.039). The blood
graft composition was comparable between the groups. Hematologic recovery within 
12 months post-transplant did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide-based induction seems to have an impact on the number of
aphereses performed, but not on the total yields of the CD34+ cells in the graft.
Neither cellular composition of the grafts nor post-transplant recovery was
affected by the limited pre-transplant exposure to lenalidomide.
