Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) are associated with enhancement of
metastasis and poor cancer outcomes. Circulating PMPs transfer platelet microRNAs
(miRNAs) to vascular cells. Solid tumor vasculature is highly permeable, allowing
the possibility of PMP-tumor cell interaction. Here, we show that PMPs infiltrate
solid tumors in humans and mice and transfer platelet-derived RNA, including
miRNAs, to tumor cells in vivo and in vitro, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis.
MiR-24 was a major species in this transfer. PMP transfusion inhibited growth of 
both lung and colon carcinoma ectopic tumors, whereas blockade of miR-24 in tumor
cells accelerated tumor growth in vivo, and prevented tumor growth inhibition by 
PMPs. Conversely, Par4-deleted mice, which had reduced circulating microparticles
(MPs), supported accelerated tumor growth which was halted by PMP transfusion.
PMP targeting was associated with tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. We identified
direct RNA targets of platelet-derived miR-24 in tumor cells, which included
mitochondrial mt-Nd2, and Snora75, a noncoding small nucleolar RNA. These RNAs
were suppressed in PMP-treated tumor cells, resulting in mitochondrial
dysfunction and growth inhibition, in an miR-24-dependent manner. Thus,
platelet-derived miRNAs transfer in vivo to tumor cells in solid tumors via
infiltrating MPs, regulate tumor cell gene expression, and modulate tumor
progression. These findings provide novel insight into mechanisms of horizontal
RNA transfer and add multiple layers to the regulatory roles of miRNAs and PMPs
in tumor progression. Plasma MP-mediated transfer of regulatory RNAs and
modulation of gene expression may be a common feature with important outcomes in 
contexts of enhanced vascular permeability.
