Removal of ubiquitinated targets by autophagosomes can be mediated by receptor
molecules, like SQSTM1, in a mechanism referred to as selective autophagy. While 
cytoplasmic protein aggregates, mitochondria, and bacteria are the best-known
targets of selective autophagy, their role in the turnover of membrane receptors 
is scarce. We here showed that fasting-induced wasting of skeletal muscle
involves remodeling of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by increasing the
turnover of muscle-type CHRN (cholinergic receptor, nicotinic/nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor) in a TRIM63-dependent manner. Notably, this process
implied enhanced production of endo/lysosomal carriers of CHRN, which also
contained the membrane remodeler SH3GLB1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM63, and
the selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1. Furthermore, these vesicles were
surrounded by the autophagic marker MAP1LC3A in an ATG7-dependent fashion, and
some of them were also positive for the lysosomal marker, LAMP1. While the amount
of vesicles containing endocytosed CHRN strongly augmented in the absence of ATG7
as well as upon denervation as a model for long-term atrophy, denervation-induced
increase in autophagic CHRN vesicles was completely blunted in the absence of
TRIM63. On a similar note, in trim63(-/-) mice denervation-induced upregulation
of SQSTM1 and LC3-II was abolished and endogenous SQSTM1 did not colocalize with 
CHRN vesicles as it did in the wild type. SQSTM1 and LC3-II coprecipitated with
surface-labeled/endocytosed CHRN and SQSTM1 overexpression significantly induced 
CHRN vesicle formation. Taken together, our data suggested that selective
autophagy regulates the basal and atrophy-induced turnover of the pentameric
transmembrane protein, CHRN, and that TRIM63, together with SH3GLB1 and SQSTM1
regulate this process.
