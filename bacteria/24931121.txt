Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is important in cellular
homeostasis. Prior work showed a key role for the autophagy related 5 (Atg5) in
resistance to Toxoplasma gondii. Here we show that the cassette of autophagy
proteins involved in the conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3 (LC3) to phosphatidylethanolamine, including Atg7, Atg3, and the
Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex play crucial roles in the control of T. gondii
in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, pharmacologic modulation of the degradative
autophagy pathway or genetic deletion of other essential autophagy genes had no
substantial effects. Rather the conjugation system was required for targeting of 
LC3 and interferon-γ effectors onto the vacuolar membrane of T. gondii and its
consequent disruption. These data suggest that the ubiquitin-like conjugation
systems that reorganize intracellular membranes during canonical autophagy are
necessary for proper targeting of immune effectors to the intracellular vacuole
membranes utilized by pathogens.
