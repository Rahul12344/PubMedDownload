BACKGROUND: Mortality due to infective endocarditis (IE) in Chile is close to
30%.
AIM: To report the experience with patients admitted with the diagnosis of IE in 
a regional tertiary hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 107 patients aged 50 ± 16 years (75%
males) discharged with a definitive diagnosis of IE according to modified DUKE
criteria, between years 2003 and 2010. Demographic variables, severity scores,
clinical characteristics, bacteriology and hospital evolution were recorded.
RESULTS: Fifty nine percent of patients had concomitant cardiovascular problems. 
APACHE II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores on admission were
8.4 ± 4.7 and 2.7 ± 2.8 respectively. Native valves were affected in 91% of cases
(aortic and mitral valves in 62% and 50% of cases respectively). Prosthetic
valves were affected in 9.3% of cases. Rheumatic heart disease was the
predominant primary lesion in 10% of patients. Antibiotics were used in 45.1%
before blood cultures were performed. In 68% of patients blood cultures were
positive. S. viridans (30.8%), S.aureus (18.6%) and coagulase negative
Streptococci (5.6%) were the identified microorganisms. Intensive care unit
admission was required in 48% of patients. Renal, heart and neurological
deterioration was observed in 53, 34 and 14% of patients, respectively. Twenty
percent of patients developed systemic embolism and 37% required heart surgery.
Mean hospital stay was 28.3 ± 19.1 days and 27% of patients died.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients, IE has a high mortality. Most patients
studied were admitted in bad conditions.
