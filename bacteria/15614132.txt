Interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokine formed by a p35
and a p40 subunit. To determine the role of IL-12 in abdominal sepsis, p35
gene-deficient (IL-12 knockout, KO) mice and normal wild-type (WT) mice were
injected intraperitoneally with Escherichia coli. Peritonitis was associated with
a bacterial dose-dependent increase in IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p75 concentrations in 
peritoneal fluid and plasma. Whereas at 6 h postinfection, IL-12 KO and WT mice
displayed similar bacterial counts, at 20 hours IL-12 KO mice had significantly
more bacteria in liver homogenates and were more susceptible to progressing to
systemic infection. In addition, IL-12 KO mice demonstrated higher levels of
proinflammatory cytokines in peritoneal fluid and increased lung and liver
injury. IL-12 deficiency did not influence the recruitment of cells to the site
of the infection. These data suggest that endogenous IL-12 is involved in the
early antibacterial host response during abdominal sepsis.
