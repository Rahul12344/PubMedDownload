The genus Thiobacterium includes uncultivated rod-shaped microbes containing
several spherical grains of elemental sulfur and forming conspicuous gelatinous
mats. Owing to the fragility of mats and cells, their 16S ribosomal RNA genes
have not been phylogenetically classified. This study examined the occurrence of 
Thiobacterium mats in three different sulfidic marine habitats: a submerged whale
bone, deep-water seafloor and a submarine cave. All three mats contained massive 
amounts of Thiobacterium cells and were highly enriched in sulfur. Microsensor
measurements and other biogeochemistry data suggest chemoautotrophic growth of
Thiobacterium. Sulfide and oxygen microprofiles confirmed the dependence of
Thiobacterium on hydrogen sulfide as energy source. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization indicated that Thiobacterium spp. belong to the
Gammaproteobacteria, a class that harbors many mat-forming sulfide-oxidizing
bacteria. Further phylogenetic characterization of the mats led to the discovery 
of an unexpected microbial diversity associated with Thiobacterium.
