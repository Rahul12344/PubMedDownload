Epidemiological data indicate high incidence of campylobacteriosis. Improperly
prepared poultry-products, unpasteurized milk as well as non-chlorinated drinking
water were shown to be the main vehicles of Campylobacter transmission to man.
There is a lack of knowledge concerning the role of various environments in
transmission of Campylobacter. The review summarizes the present knowledge about 
occurrence and survival of Campylobacters in various environments (sewage,
sludge, surface water, drinking water). In conclusion risk assessment for public 
health is discussed.
