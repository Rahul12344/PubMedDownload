BACKGROUND: Infectious endocarditis (IE) is a bacterial infection of the
endocardium. Diagnosis is based on results obtained from echocardiography, blood 
cultures, and molecular genetic screening for bacteria and on data for
inflammatory markers such as the leukocyte (WBC) count and the C-reactive protein
(CRP) concentration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) as a supportive biomarker for the
diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of IE.
METHODS: We measured LBP and CRP concentrations and WBC counts in 57 IE patients 
at hospital admission, 40 patients with noninfectious heart valve diseases
(HVDs), and 55 healthy blood donors. The progression of these 3 markers and the
influence of cardiac surgery on them were evaluated in 29 IE patients and 21
control patients.
RESULTS: Serum LBP concentrations were significantly higher in IE patients [mean 
(SD), 33.41 (32.10) mg/L] compared with HVD patients [6.67 (1.82) mg/L, P <
0.0001] and healthy control individuals [5.61 (1.20) mg/L]. The progression in
the LBP concentration during therapy of IE patients correlated with the changes
in the CRP concentration. The 2 markers were equally influenced by antibiotic
treatment and surgical intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Serial LBP measurement may provide an effective and useful tool for 
evaluating the response to therapy in IE patients. We found a strong correlation 
between LBP and CRP concentrations; LBP has a tendency to increase earlier in
cases of reinfection.
