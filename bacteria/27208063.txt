B7-H3 (CD276) is an important immune checkpoint member of the B7 and CD28
families. Induced on antigen-presenting cells, B7-H3 plays an important role in
the inhibition of T-cell function. Importantly, B7-H3 is highly overexpressed on 
a wide range of human solid cancers and often correlates with both negative
prognosis and poor clinical outcome in patients. Challenges remain to identify
the receptor(s) of B7-H3 and thus better elucidate the role of the B7-H3 pathway 
in immune responses and tumor evasion. With a preferential expression on tumor
cells, B7-H3 is an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. Based on the
clinical success of inhibitory immune checkpoint blockade (CTLA-4, PD-1, and
PD-L1), mAbs against B7-H3 appear to be a promising therapeutic strategy worthy
of development. An unconventional mAb against B7-H3 with antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical
trial and has shown encouraging preliminary results. Additional therapeutic
approaches in targeting B7-H3, such as blocking mAbs, bispecific mAbs, chimeric
antigen receptor T cells, small-molecule inhibitors, and combination therapies,
should be evaluated, as these technologies have already shown positive results in
various cancer settings. A better understanding of the B7-H3 pathway in humans
will surely help to further optimize associated cancer immunotherapies. Clin
