CONTEXT: Diagnoses rendered as atypical/suspicious for malignancy on fine-needle 
aspiration (FNA) of pancreatic mass lesions range from 2% to 29% in various
studies. We have identified the expression of 3 genes, MUC4, MUC16, and NGAL that
are highly upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this study, we analyzed
the expression of these markers in FNA samples to determine whether they could
improve sensitivity and specificity.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of MUC4, MUC16, and NGAL in the evaluation of 
pancreatic FNA specimens.
DESIGN: Records of pancreatic FNAs performed during 10 consecutive years were
reviewed. Unstained sections from corresponding cell blocks were immunostained
for MUC4, MUC16, and NGAL (polyclonal). Immunostaining was assessed using the
H-score (range, 0-3). Any case with an H-score of >0.5 was considered positive.
RESULTS: Cases were classified using cytomorphologic criteria as adenocarcinoma
(31 of 64; 48.4%), benign (17 of 64; 26.6%), and atypical/suspicious (16 of 64;
25%). On follow-up, all cases (100%; 31 of 31) diagnosed as carcinoma on cytology
were confirmed on biopsy/resection samples or by clinical follow-up (such as
unresectable disease). Of the cases diagnosed as atypical/suspicious, 69% (11 of 
16) were found to be positive for adenocarcinoma and 31% (5 of 16) were benign on
subsequent follow-up. Overall sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for the 
various markers for the detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were as follows:
MUC4 (74% and 100%), MUC16 (62.9% and 100%), and NGAL (61.3% and 58.8%). In cases
that were atypical/suspicious on cytology, expression of MUC4 and MUC16 was 100% 
specific for carcinoma with sensitivities of 63.6% and 66.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Immunocytochemistry for MUC4 and MUC16 appears to be a useful adjunct
in the classification of pancreatic FNA samples, especially in cases that are
equivocal (atypical/suspicious) for adenocarcinoma on cytomorphologic assessment.
