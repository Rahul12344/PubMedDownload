We previously showed that immature CD166(+) osteoblasts (OB) promote
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. Here, we demonstrate that CD166 is a
functional HSC marker that identifies both murine and human long-term
repopulating cells. Both murine LSKCD48(-)CD166(+)CD150(+) and
LSKCD48(-)CD166(+)CD150(+)CD9(+) cells, as well as human
Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD49f(+)CD166(+) cells sustained significantly higher levels 
of chimerism in primary and secondary recipients than CD166(-) cells. CD166(-/-) 
knockout (KO) LSK cells engrafted poorly in wild-type (WT) recipients and KO bone
marrow cells failed to radioprotect lethally irradiated WT recipients. CD166(-/-)
hosts supported short-term, but not long-term WT HSC engraftment, confirming that
loss of CD166 is detrimental to the competence of the hematopoietic niche.
CD166(-/-) mice were significantly more sensitive to hematopoietic stress.
Marrow-homed transplanted WT hematopoietic cells lodged closer to the recipient
endosteum than CD166(-/-) cells, suggesting that HSC-OB homophilic CD166
interactions are critical for HSC engraftment. STAT3 has 3 binding sites on the
CD166 promoter and STAT3 inhibition reduced CD166 expression, suggesting that
both CD166 and STAT3 may be functionally coupled and involved in HSC competence. 
These studies illustrate the significance of CD166 in the identification and
engraftment of HSC and in HSC-niche interactions, and suggest that CD166
expression can be modulated to enhance HSC function.
