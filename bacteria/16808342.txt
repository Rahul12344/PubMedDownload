Subunits 70S, 50S, and 30S of ribosomes of E. coli and T. maritima have been
studied by atomic force microscopy. A considerable heterogeneity of structures
was visualized when 70S and 30S subunits were sorbed on mica. The linear size and
the height of molecules were estimated. It was found that the heights of
ribosomes of E. coli and T. maritima substantially differ. The average height of 
70S ribosomes of E. coli was 9.4 + 0.01 nm and that of T. maritima was 10.35 +/- 
0.02 nm. The differences in the dimensions were probably determined by special
organization of the mobile ribosomal element the L7/L12-stalk.
