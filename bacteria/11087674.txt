To elucidate the structural basis for important differences between types I and
II regulatory subunit isoforms (RI and RII) of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, the full-length RII beta isoform
and five RII beta deletion mutants were constructed, expressed, purified, and
screened for crystallization. Only one of these six proteins yielded diffraction 
quality crystals. Crystals were grown of the RII beta deletion mutant (delta
1-111) monomer potentially in complex with two cAMP molecules. X-ray diffraction 
quality data were obtained only after significant modification to existing
purification procedures. Modifications required a Sepharose, not agarose, support
for cAMP affinity chromatography followed by rapid, quantitative removal of free 
cAMP by size-exclusion chromatography under reducing conditions. Data to 2.4 A
resolution were collected at 29 degrees C using synchrotron radiation on a single
crystal measuring 0.2 x 0.3 x 1.2 mm(3). Data were 99% complete. The hexagonal
crystal belonged to space group P6((1)) or P6((5)) with unit cell dimensions a = 
b = 161.62 A and c = 39.66 A.
