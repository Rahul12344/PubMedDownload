In the last three decades, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased in
incidence and severity in many countries worldwide. The increase in CDI incidence
has been particularly apparent among surgical patients. Therefore, prevention of 
CDI and optimization of management in the surgical patient are paramount. An
international multidisciplinary panel of experts from the World Society of
Emergency Surgery (WSES) updated its guidelines for management of CDI in surgical
patients according to the most recent available literature. The update includes
recent changes introduced in the management of this infection.
