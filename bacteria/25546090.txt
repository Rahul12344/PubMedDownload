NKp44 (NCR2) is a distinct member of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) family
that can induce cytokine production and cytolytic activity in human NK cells.
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are differentially expressed in various
normal and cancerous tissues. HSPGs were reported to serve as ligands/co-ligands 
for NKp44 and other NCRs. However, HSPG expression is not restricted to either
group and can be found also in NK cells. Our current study reveals that NKp44
function can be modulated through interactions with HSPGs on NK cells themselves 
in -cis rather than on target cells in -trans. The intimate interaction of NKp44 
and the NK cell-associated HSPG syndecan-4 (SDC4) in -cis can directly regulate
membrane distribution of NKp44 and constitutively dampens the triggering of the
receptor. We further demonstrate, that the disruption of NKp44 and SDC4
interaction releases the receptor to engage with its ligands in -trans and
therefore enhances NKp44 activation potential and NK cell functional response.
