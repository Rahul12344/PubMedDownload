BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients frequently develop acute lung injury (ALI).
Disturbed alveolar fibrin turnover, a characteristic feature of ALI, is the
result of both activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis.
Nebulized fibrinolytic agents could exert lung-protective effects, via promotion 
of fibrinolysis as well as anti-inflammation.
METHODS: Rats were challenged intratracheally with Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
resulting in pneumonia as a model for direct ALI, or received an intravenous
bolus infusion of lipopolysaccharide, as a model for indirect ALI. Rats were
randomized to nebulization of normal saline (placebo), recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (rtPA), or monoclonal antibodies against plasminogen
activator inhibitor-type 1 (anti-PAI-1).
RESULTS: Nebulized rtPA or anti-PA1-1 enhanced the bronchoalveolar fibrinolytic
system, as reflected by a significant reduction of PAI-1 activity levels in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and a consequent increase in plasminogen activator 
activity (PAA) levels to supranormal values. Both treatments also significantly
affected systemic fibrinolysis as reflected by a significant increase in PAA
levels in plasma to supranormal levels. Neither nebulized rtPA nor anti-PA1-1
affected pulmonary inflammation. Neither treatment affected bacterial clearance
of P. aeruginosa from the lungs in case of pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Local treatment with rtPA or anti-PA1-1 affects pulmonary
fibrinolysis but not inflammation in models of direct or indirect ALI in rats.
