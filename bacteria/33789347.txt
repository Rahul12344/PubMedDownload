The gram-negative bacterium Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Query (Q)
fever in humans and coxiellosis in livestock. Host genetics are associated with
C. burnetii pathogenesis both in humans and animals; however, it remains unknown 
if specific genes are associated with severity of infection. We employed the
Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel to perform a genome-wide association study to
identify host genetic variants that affect host survival to C. burnetii
infection. The genome-wide association study identified 64 unique variants
(P < 10-5) associated with 25 candidate genes. We examined the role each
candidate gene contributes to host survival during C. burnetii infection using
flies carrying a null mutation or RNAi knockdown of each candidate. We validated 
15 of the 25 candidate genes using at least one method. This is the first report 
establishing involvement of many of these genes or their homologs with C.
burnetii susceptibility in any system. Among the validated genes, FER and tara
play roles in the JAK/STAT, JNK, and decapentaplegic/TGF-β signaling pathways
which are components of known innate immune responses to C. burnetii infection.
CG42673 and DIP-ε play roles in bacterial infection and synaptic signaling but
have no previous association with C. burnetii pathogenesis. Furthermore, since
the mammalian ortholog of CG13404 (PLGRKT) is an important regulator of
macrophage function, CG13404 could play a role in host susceptibility to C.
burnetii through hemocyte regulation. These insights provide a foundation for
further investigation regarding the genetics of C. burnetii susceptibility across
a wide variety of hosts.
