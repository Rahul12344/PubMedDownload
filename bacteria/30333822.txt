T cells producing IFNγ play a pathogenic role in the development of inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD). To investigate the functions of CD1d-dependent invariant
natural killer T (iNKT) cells in experimental colitis induced in Yeti mice with
dysregulated expression of IFNγ, we generated iNKT cell-deficient Yeti/CD1d KO
mice and compared colitis among WT, CD1d KO, Yeti, and Yeti/CD1d KO mice
following DSS treatment. We found that deficiency of iNKT cells exacerbated
colitis and disease pathogenesis was mainly mediated by NK1.1+CD8+ T cells.
Furthermore, the protective effects of iNKT cells correlated with up-regulation
of regulatory T cells. Taken together, our results have demonstrated that
CD1d-dependent iNKT cells and CD1d-independent NK1.1+CD8+ T cells reciprocally
regulate the development of intestinal inflammatory responses mediated by
IFNγ-dysregulation. These findings also identify NK1.1+CD8+ T cells as novel
target cells for the development of therapeutics for human IBD.
