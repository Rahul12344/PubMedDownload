We report a patient in Automatic Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) with tuberculous
peritonitis by possible peritoneal infection due to the proximity between
fallopian tube and the left ovary, a peritoneal liquid culture was constantly
negative. The patient presented a bad clinic evolution. Her only medical history 
was hypercalcemia six months before developing a peritonitis and occasionally
nausea and vomits To confirm the diagnosis it was needed a peritoneal biopsy by
means of a laparoscopy with a removal of the peritoneal catheter and left
anexectomy. Now, the patient is asintomatic in daily home hemodialysis.
