in human leprosy.

We used human leprosy as a model to compare patterns of costimulatory molecule
expression in respect to the clinical/immunologic spectrum of disease. We found
that B7-1, B7-2, and CD28 transcripts dominated in tuberculoid leprosy patients, 
who have potent T cell responses to Mycobacterium leprae. In contrast, CTLA-4 was
more strongly expressed in lesions from lepromatous patients, who manifest
specific T cell anergy to the leprosy bacterium. T cell clones from tuberculoid
lesions were CD4+CD28+ or CD4+CD28-, and T cell clones from lepromatous lesions
were predominantly CD8+CD28-. The M. leprae-specific recall response of CD4+ T
cell clones from tuberculoid lesions was blocked by anti-B7-1 mAb, but not by
anti-B7-2 mAb or CTLA-Ig. However, anti-CD28 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs did not block
activation of clones from tuberculoid lesions, suggesting that B7-1 may utilize
another costimulatory pathway. Peripheral blood T cell responses in the
lepromatous form were strongly regulated by CD28 during T cell activation, in
contrast to the tuberculoid form. Thus, B7-1 costimulation could play a role in
maintaining a strong immune response to the pathogen.
