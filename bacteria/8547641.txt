To determine whether signaling via CD122 (interleukin-2 [IL-2]/IL-15 receptor
beta-chain) plays a role in regulating the expansion and differentiation of
lymphocyte precursors, we have characterized its expression and evaluated its
ability to influence the activity of developing lymphoid cells. A significant
fraction of Sca1+Lin- hematopoietic stem cells in day 12 fetal liver were found
to be CD122+. CD122-mRNA+ and IL-2-mRNA+ cells were also localized in embryo
sections within pharyngeal blood vessels adjacent to and surrounding the thymic
analgen. This distribution is consistent with the migration of CD122+ progenitor 
cells from the liver to the developing thymus where a majority of Sca1+
intrathymic T-cell progenitors were CD122+. Analysis of CD122 expression in the
day 12 fetal liver revealed that the majority of B220+ cells were CD122+.
Furthermore, CD122 expression was restricted to the earliest B220+ cells
(CD43+CD24-; prepro B cells; fraction A) that proliferate vigorously to IL-2 in
the absence of any stromal cells, but not to IL-15. Consistent with a role for
the IL-2/IL-2R pathway in lymphocyte development is the progressive loss of B
cells seen in IL-2-deficient mice. Together, these observations suggest that
CD122 plays a role in regulating normal lymphocyte development in vivo.
