OBJECTIVE: To lay a foundation for researches on the expression of gene
engineering anti-tumor drugs.
METHODS: On the basis of mRNA sequence of human thrombospondin-1(TSP-1), two
pairs of primers were designed and synthesized. Two active fragments TSP-1,
called TSP-1-I and TSP-1-III, were obtained by using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The sizes of those two fragments
were found to be 728 bp and 257 bp respectively. They were purified and then
cloned into pMDT vector after transformation into Escherichia coli with
recombined DNAs.
RESULTS: Plasmid DNAs were isolated from transformants and digested with
restriction enzyme. The results from agarose gel electrophorasis showed that
these two fragments had been inserted into vector and their sizes were in accord 
with the expected values. Sequence analysis demonstrated that TSP-1-I is 728 bp
in size and encodes a peptide containing 212 amino acid residues with relative
molecular mass of 23.6 x 10(3) and the TSP-I III is 257 bp in size and encodes a 
peptide containing 86 amino acid residues with relative molecular mass of 9.5 x
10(3).
CONCLUSION: The results from homology analysis indicate that the sequence of
these two fragments is identified with that of TSP-1 of Genbank.
