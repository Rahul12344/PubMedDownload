Urological implants in the urinary tract are routinely used to ensure urine flow.
However, the morbidities are numerous concerning long-term derivations.
Especially with the ureteral stents, failure can have considerable consequences. 
Since the surfaces of all urological implants are more or less ideal substrates
for microorganisms, the formation of bacterial biofilms is a regularly observed
and often serious complication, which in many cases forces early implant
replacement. The burden on the patient and the health system are enormous. This
article provides an overview of the numerous strategies developed or under
development to protect against bacterial adhesion. Observations in use show
"sometimes good, sometimes bad results" for all strategies, which may be due to
the fact that the treated patients have different biological and clinical
conditions. The implants are each equipped with defense mechanisms designed for
certain "scenarios"; if they are used inadequately in this respect, they cannot
optimally fulfill their task. Systematic observations of the "outcomes" and
evaluation of the obtained data would be necessary in order to be able to assign 
an "optimal" effect spectrum to each defense strategy, thus, ultimately
prospectively giving patients the most suitable product in advance. Systematic
use of the existing implant concepts can avoid a large number of implant-related 
complications "ad hoc"; further development steps with regard to improved surface
modifications can be made more specifically. However, the hope of a "super
strategy" is likely to remain unfulfilled because bacteria as "opponents" have
already proved billions of years of survival.
