We describe a mini-Tn7-based broad-host-range expression cassette for
arabinose-inducible gene expression from the P(BAD) promoter. This delivery
vector, pTJ1, can integrate a single copy of a gene into the chromosome of
Gram-negative bacteria for diverse genetic applications, of which several are
discussed, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the model host.
