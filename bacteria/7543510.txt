The importance of CD28 costimulation to a primary T cell response in vivo was
assessed in an adoptive transfer system where a small population of
peptide-specific CD4+ TCR transgenic T cells can be physically tracked.
Ag-dependent clonal expansion of the transgenic T cells in draining lymph nodes
was blocked by cyclosporin A and required a CD28 signal that was completely
inhibited by CTLA-4-Ig or a combination of anti-B7-1 and anti-B7-2 mAbs, but not 
by either Ab alone. In vivo treatment with the combination of anti-B7-1 and
anti-B7-2 mAbs also blocked conversion of the Ag-specific T cells to the
activated phenotype. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 Fab greatly enhanced the in vivo
clonal expansion of the Ag-specific T cells. These results suggest that Ag-driven
proliferation and phenotype conversion of naive CD4+ T cells is dependent on
CD28-derived signals and is inhibited by CTLA-4.
