The presence of Candida albicans in the biofilm underlying the dental prosthesis 
is related to denture stomatitis (DS), an inflammatory reaction of the oral
mucosa. The oral epithelium, a component of the innate immune response, has the
ability to react to fungal invasion. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro
effect of viable C. albicans on the apoptosis, nitric oxide (NO) production, and 
β-defensin 2 (hBD-2) expression and production of human palate epithelial cells
(HPECs). We further determined whether or not these effects were correlated with 
fungal invasion of epithelial cells. Interaction between HPEC primary culture and
C. albicans was obtained through either direct or indirect cell-cell contact with
a supernatant from a hyphal fungus. We found that the hyphae supernatants were
sufficient to induce slight HPEC apoptosis, which occurred prior to the
activation of the specific mechanisms of epithelial defense. The epithelial
defense responses were found to occur via NO and antimicrobial peptide hBD-2
production only during direct contact between C. albicans and HPECs and coincided
with the fungus's intraepithelial invasion. However, although the hBD-2 levels
remained constant in the HPEC supernatants over time, the NO release and hBD-2
gene expression were reduced at a later time (10 h), indicating that the
epithelial defense capacity against the fungal invasion was not maintained in
later phases. This aspect of the immune response was associated with increased
epithelial invasion and apoptosis maintenance.
