Silencing of SOCS1 protein with shRNAi lentivirus (shR-SOCS1) led to partial
reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. SOCS1
silencing inhibited cell migration and invasion as well as in vitro growth by
cell cycle arrest at S phase with increased cell size and nuclei. Down-regulation
of SOCS1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, Ins-Rα,
and fibroblast growth factor receptors. The present work aimed at analyzing the
SOCS1 cell signaling and expression of proteins relevant to tumor development. An
RNA microarray analysis of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells with SOCS1 silenced by
shRNAi-SOCS1 was undertaken in comparison with cells transduced with the empty
vector. Among 609 differentially expressed genes, c-Kit, Met and EphA3
cytokine/tyrosine-kinase (TK) receptors were down regulated. A significant
decrease in the expression of TK receptors, the phosphorylation of mediators of
ERK1/2 and p38 pathways and STAT3 (S727) were observed. Subcutaneous immunization
with shR-SOCS1-transduced viable tumor cells rendered protection against melanoma
in a syngeneic model, with decreased expression of PD-L1 and of matrix
metallo-proteinases (MMPs) and CD-10 in those cells. The present work shows the
role of SOCS1 in murine melanoma development and the potential of SOCS1-silenced 
tumor cells in raising an effective anti-melanoma immune response.
