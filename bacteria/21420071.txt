OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of 
different biomaterials used for regenerative periodontal surgery on the growth of
the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
METHODS: Three commercially available biomaterials of synthetic origin
(hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate, nanostructured hydroxyapatite paste,
oily calcium hydroxide suspension), a bovine-derived xenograft as well as an
enamel matrix derivative (EMD) were added in different concentrations to
calibrated suspensions of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718/33384 (serotype
b/c). Equal aliquots (0.1 ml) for the viability assay were taken after 5 min, 1h,
3h, 8h and 24h, plated on blood agar and incubated in an anaerobic environment
for 48 h at 37°C. Viable cell counts were expressed as colony forming units
(cfu)/0.1 ml.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that none of the investigated biomaterials
could inhibit the growth of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b. A marked growth 
reduction of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was observed in the presence of 
oily calcium hydroxide suspension and nanostructured hydroxyapatite. In contrast,
no significant growth inhibition could be observed in the presence of
hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate, enamel matrix derivative and
bovine-derived xenograft.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that none of the
investigated biomaterials possesses antimicrobial properties against A.
actinomycetemcomitans serotype b. Therefore, the use of these biomaterials for
regenerative procedures should be weighted critically in the presence of A.
actinomycetemcomitans serotype b.
