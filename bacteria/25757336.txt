The biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate by Methylobacteria extorquens G10 and
Methyloligella halotolerans C2 via the serine pathway of C1 metabolism was
comparatively studied. Nitrogen limitation stimulated synthesis of the biopolymer
in both cultures. It was shown that, despite the similarity of the pathways of
methanol metabolism and those of polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis, the
methylobacteria synthesized polymers of different molecular weights. In the case 
of M. extorquens G10, an increase in the content of the residual nitrogen in the 
culture medium was found to result in a reduction of the molecular weight of the 
polymer from 250 to 85 kDa, whereas M. halotolerans C2 synthesized a polymer of
high molecular weight (approximately 3000 kDa) regardless of the residual content
of the nitrogen source. It was established that the examined methylobacteria can 
utilize not only pure methanol but also a crude one, a feature that made it
possible to significantly reduce the cost of the resulting polyhydroxybutyrate.
