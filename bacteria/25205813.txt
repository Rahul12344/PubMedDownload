CXCR6-GFP(+) cells, which encompass 70% invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT
cells), have been found primarily patrolling inside blood vessels in the liver.
Although the iNKT cells fail to interact with live pathogens, they do respond to 
bacterial glycolipids presented by CD1d on liver macrophage that have caught the 
microbe. In contrast, in this study using dual laser multichannel spinning-disk
intravital microscopy of joints, the CXCR6-GFP, which also made up 60-70% iNKT
cells, were not found in the vasculature but rather closely apposed to and
surrounding the outside of blood vessels, and to a lesser extent throughout the
extravascular space. These iNKT cells also differed in behavior, responding
rapidly and directly to joint-homing pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi, which
causes Lyme disease. These iNKT cells interacted with B. burgdorferi at the
vessel wall and disrupted dissemination attempts by these microbes into joints.
Successful penetrance of B. burgdorferi out of the vasculature and into the joint
tissue was met by a lethal attack by extravascular iNKT cells through a
granzyme-dependent pathway, an observation also made in vitro for iNKT cells from
joint but not liver or spleen. These results suggest a novel, critical
extravascular iNKT cell immune surveillance in joints that functions as a
cytotoxic barrier and explains a large increase in pathogen burden of B.
burgdorferi in the joint of iNKT cell-deficient mice, and perhaps the greater
susceptibility of humans to this pathogen because of fewer iNKT cells in human
joints.
