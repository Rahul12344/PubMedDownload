Defensins are known to play an important role in defense against bacteria. It is 
also known that immunity against infection is compromised with age. The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the localization of human beta-defensin (HBD)-2 in 
human gingival epithelia according to age. Gingival epithelia in maxillary
premolar buccal normal regions was immunohistochemically stained for HBD-2.
Specimens were divided into two groups: 6 cases in a young group (<20 years old) 
and 7 cases in an elderly group (>50 years old). Expression of HBD-2 in gingival 
epithelium in young subjects was mostly detected in the superficial layer of the 
parakeratinized layer, while some areas of the spinous cell layer in elderly
subjects were positive for HBD-2, as was the superficial layer. Two cases in the 
young group and 5 cases in the elderly group immunoreacted with HBD-2 in the
spinous cell layer. Furthermore, immunoreaction was stronger in the elderly
group. The results revealed HBD-2 positive cells in spinous cells in the elderly 
group and in the parakeratinized layer in the young group.
