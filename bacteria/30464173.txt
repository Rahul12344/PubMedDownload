Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have
become a powerful tool for human disease modeling and therapeutic testing.
However, their use remains limited by their immaturity and heterogeneity. To
characterize the source of this heterogeneity, we applied complementary
single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq technologies over time during hiPSC cardiac 
differentiation and in the adult heart. Using integrated transcriptomic and
splicing analysis, more than half a dozen distinct single-cell populations were
observed, several of which were coincident at a single time-point, day 30 of
differentiation. To dissect the role of distinct cardiac transcriptional
regulators associated with each cell population, we systematically tested the
effect of a gain or loss of three transcription factors (NR2F2, TBX5, and HEY2), 
using CRISPR genome editing and ChIP-seq, in conjunction with patch clamp,
calcium imaging, and CyTOF analysis. These targets, data, and integrative
genomics analysis methods provide a powerful platform for understanding in vitro 
cellular heterogeneity.
