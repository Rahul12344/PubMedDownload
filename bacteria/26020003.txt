Transporter-facilitated arsenite extrusion is the major pathway of arsenic
resistance within bacteria. So far only two types of membrane-bound transporter
proteins, ArsB and ArsY (ACR3), have been well studied, although the arsenic
transporters in bacteria display considerable diversity. Utilizing accumulated
genome sequence data, we searched arsenic resistance (ars) operons in about 2,500
bacterial strains and located over 700 membrane-bound transporters which are
encoded in these operons. Sequence analysis revealed at least five distinct
transporter families, with ArsY being the most dominant, followed by ArsB, ArsP
(a recently reported permease family), Major Facilitator protein Superfamily
(MFS) and Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP). In addition, other types of transporters
encoded in the ars operons were found, but in much lower frequencies. The
diversity and evolutionary relationships of these transporters with regard to
arsenic resistance will be discussed.
