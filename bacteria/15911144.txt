Brain-2 (Brn-2), a Class III POU transcription factor, plays an important role in
the development of the neocortex and the establishment of neural cell lineage.
Here we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify the Brn-2 binding
proteins. We obtained Jun-activation-domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) as a new
Brn-2 binding protein. Direct interaction between Brn-2 and Jab1 was confirmed by
using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Considering the involvement of Jab1 
in the onset of the neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and
Alzheimer's disease, the interaction between Brn-2 and Jab1 may provide some
insights into the understanding of neuronal development and neurodegenerative
diseases.
