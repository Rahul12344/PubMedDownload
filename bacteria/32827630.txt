Albocycline (ALB) is a unique macrolactone natural product with potent,
narrow-spectrum activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate (VISA), and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA)
strains (MIC = 0.5-1.0 μg/mL). Described herein is the synthesis and evaluation
of a novel series analogs derived from albocycline by functionalization at three 
specific sites: the C2-C3 enone, the tertiary carbinol at C4, and the allylic C16
methyl group. Exploration of the structure-activity relationships (SAR) by means 
of minimum inhibitory concentration assays (MICs) revealed that C4 ester analog 6
was twice as potent as ALB, which represents a class of lead compound that can be
further studied to address multi-drug resistant pathogens.
