Penicillenols (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) were isolated from Aspergillus
restrictus DFFSCS006, and could differentially inhibit biofilm formation and
eradicate pre-developed biofilms of Candida albicans. Their structure-bioactivity
relationships suggested that the saturation of hydrocarbon chain at C-8,
R-configuration of C-5 and trans-configuration of the double bond between C-5 and
C-6 of pyrrolidine-2,4-dione unit were important for their anti-biofilm
activities. Penicillenols A2 and B1 slowed the hyphal growth and suppressed the
transcripts of hypha specific genes HWP1, ALS1, ALS3, ECE1 and SAP4. Moreover,
penicillenols A2 and B1 were found to act synergistically with amphotericin B
against C. albicans biofilm formation.
