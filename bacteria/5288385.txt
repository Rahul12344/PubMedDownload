An alternate complement pathway: C-3 cleaving activity, not due to C4,2a, on
endotoxic lipopolysaccharide after treatment with guinea pig serum; relation to
properdin.

Marcus RL, Shin HS, Mayer MM.

The reaction between endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the guinea pig
complement system was shown to proceed by way of an intermediate complex, LPS-X, 
which contains at least six guinea pig serum proteins. LPS-X, like [unk] (sheep
erythrocytes carrying antibody molecules and [unk] complexes), destroys the C3
molecule by cleavage. On incubation at 37 degrees C, LPS-X loses its capacity to 
destroy C3 at about the same rate as the decay of [unk], so that it has been
assumed that LPS-X carries [unk] sites that are responsible for the destruction
of C3. We have now shown that monospecific rabbit antiguinea pig C2, which
effectively inhibits C3 cleavage by [unk], does not interfere with the
destruction of C3 by LPS-X. Furthermore, not more than a trace of C2a(d) is
released from LPS-X on incubation at 37 degrees C. These results indicate that
LPS-X does not carry a significant quantity of [unk] and, hence, that its
capacity to destroy C3 is due to another factor which is presumably a component
of the properdin system.
