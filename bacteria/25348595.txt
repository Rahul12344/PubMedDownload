Bioorthogonal cleavable linkers are attractive building blocks for compounds that
can be manipulated to study biological and cellular processes. Sodium dithionite 
sensitive azobenzene-containing (Abc) peptides were applied for the temporary
stabilization of recombinant MHC complexes, which can then be employed to
generate libraries of MHC tetramers after exchange with a novel epitope. This
technology represents an important tool for high-throughput studies of
disease-specific T cell responses.
