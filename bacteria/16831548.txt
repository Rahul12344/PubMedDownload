A nutritional assay has been conducted with rainbow trout fry (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) using a biomass of photosynthetic micro-organisms. The algal biomass was 
incorporated in the feed at increasing levels (12.5%, 25% and 50%) in order to
verify the effects on survival (%), growth (length and mass) and carcass quality 
of the fish (skin color, water, protein and lipid content). Two commercial feeds 
(CF, as sold, and 0% A, reprocessed without algae) have been used as controls.
After eight weeks at 10 degrees C, the growth has been significantly reduced in
fish fed the feeds containing 25% and 50% algae diets (P<0.01). Moreover, an
incorporation of algae higher than 12.5% in the feed led to a increase of water
content (CF versus other diets; P<0.01) and TL (CF versus 50% A; P<0.01) (wet
basis) content of carcasses. Survival was 100% in all treatment groups. Under the
experimental conditions used, the results obtained show that a maximum of 12.5%
of algal biomass can be incorporated in the feed for rainbow trout fry (O.
mykiss) without negative consequences on growth and body content in lipids and
energy of fish.
