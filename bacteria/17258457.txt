Synthesis of novel NAD(+) analogues that cannot be phosphorylated by NAD kinase
is reported. In these analogues the C2' hydroxyl group of the adenosine moiety
was replaced by fluorine in the ribo or arabino configuration (1 and 2,
respectively) or was inverted into arabino configuration to give compound 3.
Compounds 1 and 2 showed inhibition of human NAD kinase, whereas analogue 3
inhibited both the human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD kinase. An uncharged 
benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD) was found to be the most potent competitive 
inhibitor (K(i)=90 microM) of the human enzyme reported so far.
