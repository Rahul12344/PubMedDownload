MBP (maltose-binding protein) is a component of Escherichia coli. Our previous
study found that MBP directly induces the activation of Th1 (T helper type 1),
but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, CD4+T cells
were purified from the spleens of normal mice using antibody-coated
immunomagnetic beads by negative selection. CD4+T cells activated with a CD3/CD28
antibody were stimulated with MBP. The results indicated that MBP elevated IFN-γ 
mRNA levels in activated CD4+T cells and promoted IFN-γ production from activated
CD4+T cells. To explore TLR2/TLR4 signaling involved in the mechanism of
MBP-induced activation of Th1, we further detected downstream molecules of
TLR2/TLR4 signaling. We found that MBP increased the mRNA levels of MyD88, TRAF6,
TRIF and TRAF3 expressed in CD4+T cells. The results suggested that downstream
molecules of TLR2/TLR4 signaling may be involved in MBP-induced activation of
CD4+T cells. Furthermore, MyD88, TRIF, TRAF3 and TRAF6 expressed in activated
CD4+T cells blocked with anti-TLR2 antibody or anti-TLR4 antibody followed by
treatment with MBP were detected via RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively.
MBP decreased the production of IFN-γ in CD4+T cells in the presence of
anti-TLR2, accompanied by the down-regulated expression of MyD88 and TRAF6.
However, MBP increased the production of IFN-γ in CD4+T cells in the presence of 
anti-TLR4 antibody accompanied by the up-regulated expression of MyD88 and the
down-regulated expression of TRIF, TRAF6 and TRAF3. The results suggested that
the MyD88-dependent pathway of TLR2 and TRIF-dependent pathway are involved in
the mechanism of Th1 activation induced by MBP. Our study has contributed to the 
clarification of the molecular mechanism of MBP-induced activation of CD4+T
cells.
