BACKGROUND: Environmental concerns about peat extraction in wetland ecosystems
have increased. Therefore, there is an international effort to evaluate
alternative organic substrates for the partial substitution of peat. The aim of
this work was to use different composts (C1-C10) obtained from the fruit and
vegetable processing industry (pepper, carrot, broccoli, orange, artichoke
residues, sewage sludge (citric and pepper) and vineyard pruning wastes) to
produce added-value composts as growing media with suppressive effect against
Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. melonis (FOM) in muskmelon.
RESULTS: Composts showed values of water-soluble carbon fractions and
dehydrogenase activity that allowed them to be considered mature and stabilized. 
All compost treatments produced significantly (F = 7.382; P < 0.05) higher fresh 
shoot weight than peat, treatment T-C2 showing the highest values. Treatments
T-C5, T-C7 and T-C8 showed percentages of disease incidence that were
significantly (F = 16.052; P < 0.05) the lowest, relative to peat, followed by
T-C6, T-C10, T-C1 and T-C9 with values below 50%.
CONCLUSION: Composts produced are suitable components of mixed compost-peat
growing media, providing a 50% substitution of peat. Furthermore, some of these
composts also showed an added value as a suppressive organic medium against
Fusarium wilt in muskmelon seedling, a fact probably related to high pH and
pepper wastes and high content of pruning waste as initial raw materials. © 2016
