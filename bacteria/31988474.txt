Surveys of 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from marine sediments have indicated
that a widely distributed group of Gammaproteobacteria, named "JTB255-Marine
Benthic Group" (now the candidate order Woeseiales), accounts for 1-22% of the
retrieved sequences. Despite their ubiquity in seafloor communities, little is
known about their distribution and specific ecological niches in the deep sea,
which constitutes the largest biome globally. Here, we characterized the
phylogeny, environmental distribution patterns, abundance, and metabolic
potential of Woeseiales bacteria with a focus on representatives from the deep
sea. From a phylogenetic analysis of publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequences
(≥1400 bp, n = 994), we identified lineages of Woeseiales with greater prevalence
in the deep sea than in coastal environments, a pattern corroborated by the
distribution of 16S oligotypes recovered from 28 globally distributed sediment
samples. Cell counts revealed that Woeseiales bacteria accounted for 5 ± 2% of
all microbial cells in deep-sea surface sediments at 23 globally distributed
sites. Comparative analyses of a genome, metagenome bins, and single-cell genomes
suggested that members of the corresponding clades are likely to grow on
proteinaceous matter, potentially derived from detrital cell membranes, cell
walls, and other organic remnants in marine sediments.
