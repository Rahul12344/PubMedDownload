Entry into mitosis requires the activity of the Cdc2 kinase. Cdc2 associates with
the B-type cyclins, and the Cdc2-cyclin B heterodimer is in turn regulated by
phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of threonine 161 is required for the Cdc2-cyclin
B complex to be catalytically active, whereas phosphorylation of threonine 14 and
tyrosine 15 is inhibitory. Human kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of
threonine 161 and tyrosine 15 have been identified. Here we report the isolation 
of a novel human cDNA encoding a dual-specificity protein kinase (designated
Myt1Hu) that preferentially phosphorylates Cdc2 on threonine 14 in a
cyclin-dependent manner. Myt1Hu is 46% identical to Myt1Xe, a kinase recently
characterized from Xenopus laevis. Myt1Hu localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum 
and Golgi complex in HeLa cells. A stretch of hydrophobic and uncharged amino
acids located outside the catalytic domain of Myt1Hu is the likely
membrane-targeting domain, as its deletion results in the localization of Myt1Hu 
primarily to the nucleus.
