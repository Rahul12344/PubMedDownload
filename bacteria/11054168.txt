Microbial analysis of contaminated soil and uncontaminated plant and faecal
material resulted in the enrichment of a number of microbial communities capable 
of utilizing a range of environmental pollutants. Growth was observed on
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, heterocyclic
aromatic compounds and organochlorine pesticides. However, none of the
communities could grow on pentachlorophenol. Pure cultures were isolated from
microbial communities using phenanthrene and pyrene as the sole carbon and energy
source. Isolates were also obtained using DDT, DOH, DBH and PCPA when peptone was
supplemented to the medium. Strain AJR39,504, isolated using DDT and peptone,
could not be positively identified on the basis of substrate utilization tests.
However, it most closely resembled Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (0.424
similarity) using the Microlog 3 database software. Isolate AJR39, 504 could also
grow on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated- and nitro-aromatic
compounds. In addition, the degradation of DDT (100 mg l(-1)) by isolate
AJR39,504 resulted in a 35% decrease in DDT concentration after 28 days with a
concomitant increase in DDD concentration.
