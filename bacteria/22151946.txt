BACKGROUND: Membrane proteins (MPs) populate 20-30% of genomes sequenced to date 
and hold potential as therapeutic targets as well as for practical applications
in bionanotechnology. However, MP toxicity and low yields in normally robust
expression hosts such as E. coli has curtailed progress in our understanding of
their structure and function.
RESULTS: Using the seven transmembrane segments H. turkmenica deltarhodopsin
(HtdR) as a reporter, we isolated a spontaneous mutant in the arabinose-inducible
P(BAD) promoter leading to improved cell growth and a twofold increase in the
recovery of active HtdR at 37°C. A single transversion in a conserved region of
the cyclic AMP receptor protein binding site caused the phenotype by reducing
htdR transcript levels by 65%. When the mutant promoter was used in conjunction
with a host lacking the molecular chaperone Trigger Factor (Δtig cells), toxicity
was further suppressed and the amount of correctly folded HtdR was 4-fold that
present in the membranes of control cells. More importantly, while improved
growth barely compensated for the reduction in transcription rates when another
polytopic membrane protein (N. pharonis sensory rhodopsin II) was expressed under
control of the mutant promoter in wild type cells, a 4-fold increase in
productivity could be achieved in a Δtig host.
CONCLUSIONS: Our system, which combines a downregulated version of the tightly
repressed P(BAD) promoter with a TF-deficient host may prove a valuable
alternative to T7-based expression for the production of membrane proteins that
have so far remained elusive targets.
