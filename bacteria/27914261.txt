UK best practice guidelines for oncoplastic breast reconstruction were published 
in 2012. Implant-based reconstruction quality indicator (QI) targets for
readmission, return to theatre and implant loss rates were set at 5% by 3 months,
along with guidance to achieve these targets. The aims of this study were to
quantify complication rates following implant-based reconstruction before and
after the implementation of the guidelines. A retrospective audit of 86 patients 
with 106 implants in the 12 months to June 2013 was performed, C1. Following
institutional changes including reducing antibiotic usage, a prospective audit
was performed on 89 patients with 105 implants to June 2014, C2. Extended
follow-up of salvaged implants was also performed. Demographics were not
significantly different between the two cohorts apart from smoking. Implant loss 
rates fell from 7.5%(C1) to 1.9%(C2), p = 0.054 but at the cost of an increase in
the return to theatre rate (14.2%-18%, p > 0.05). The implant salvage rate
increased from 47% in C1 to 89.5% in C2, however, 3 of the implants that were
salvaged were lost in the long term giving an overall salvage rate of 82.4% in
C2. While an implant loss rate of <5% at 3 months appears achievable with less
antibiotic use, this was made possible by the institution of an aggressive
readmission and salvage policy. We would question the QI standards for
readmission and return to theatre for immediate implant-based breast
reconstruction, given that our implant loss rate of 1.9% was achieved with a
return to theatre rate of 18%.
