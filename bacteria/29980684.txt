Various subsets of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells with different
cytokine productions develop in the mouse thymus, but the factors driving their
differentiation remain unclear. Here we show that hypomorphic alleles of Zap70 or
chemical inhibition of Zap70 catalysis leads to an increase of IFN-γ-producing
iNKT cells (NKT1 cells), suggesting that NKT1 cells may require a lower TCR
signal threshold. Zap70 mutant mice develop IL-17-dependent arthritis. In a mouse
experimental arthritis model, NKT17 cells are increased as the disease
progresses, while NKT1 numbers negatively correlates with disease severity, with 
this protective effect of NKT1 linked to their IFN-γ expression. NKT1 cells are
also present in the synovial fluid of arthritis patients. Our data therefore
suggest that TCR signal strength during thymic differentiation may influence not 
only IFN-γ production, but also the protective function of iNKT cells in
arthritis.
